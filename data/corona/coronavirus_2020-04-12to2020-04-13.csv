What nobody is talking about is the potential for 5G to unlock the whole ""tracking chip"" thing as a possible option. 

So here we are, all ""collectively"" acknowledging that people who believe this conspiracy are fucking stupid, and now the seed has been planted. Anyone who mentions ""5G"" and ""Coronavirus"" in the same sentence is now a nut who is preaching nonsense; very convenient right? Now anyone who may actually have some valuable information who attempts to ""sound the alarm"" can be easily dismissed as crazy by the general public. 

We shouldn't be so quick to brush all of this aside. I'm not supporting the ridiculous ""5G causes Coronavirus"" theory. But I do think we should at least acknowledge that this could purposely be a big topic in MSM right now as it would be incredibly convenient if a theory that were *somewhat* close(?) to some shady shit that's going on were to be painted as absolute nonsense and burn any possible association between the two."

2020-04-12,Tychonaut,worldnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fymcph/snowden_warns_governments_are_using_coronavirus/fn5kfgo/,">Here is an article an article from Feb 6 

So, first, you would agree that *up until* Feb 06 there were absolutely no controls in place, correct?  Or at least, there are no mentions of this anywhere, since I imagine you have been searching for this.

Second, as you see from that article the measures that were in place were *only* ""quarantine for 2 weeks"".

But .. havent we been told that is not enough?

https://www.thestate.com/news/nation-world/national/article241124531.html

- ""Some people who get the coronavirus could be contagious for a lot longer than the two-week quarantine period that many countries are using, a new study says.""
- ""A separate study in the New England Journal of Medicine said that coronavirus patients could be infected for up to 24 days before showing symptoms.""

So ... is that stuff true? or not?

Because if it *is* true, that would mean the following -

Not only were there no measures between China and India for at least one and a half months since the start of the COVID timeline ..

.. but also that the measures installed in February *would not be sufficient* to stop someone with the virus.

And so lets say *one single* asymptomatic carrier got into India somewhere in January up until Feb 06, or after Feb 06 you had someone who was infectious and who ""outlasted"" the 2 week quarantine.

(And I am not even looking at the possibilities of non-direct travel to and from China)

But lets say that *one single* person ""got in"" at some point.

Using the idea of ""exponential growth"", how many people would this carrier infect throughout February?  And how many people would *they* infect? Etc etc etc.

Or .. lets even drop the idea of this ""early infection vector"" for a moment.

Lets just wind back to the end of March.  We ""know"" that there were some coronavirus in India at that point, right?

And we ""know"" that carriers dont necessarily show symptoms.

And we ""know"" that symptoms appear after around 5 days, usually.

So take a look at India at the end of last month.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/india/india-coronavirus-social-distancing-intl-hnk/index.html

Just look at those massive crowds, all moving together.

If even *one* of those people had been a carrier, infection would have spread like wildfire.  And it would have spread exponentially.  And within about 5 days you would have had your first people in hospitals.

But there would also still have been asymptomatic carriers still running around, infecting people. Spreading exponentially.

So .. I guess at *any second now* we should be seeing footage of Indian hospitals that have been overrun with COVID victims, right?

Even when we have preventative resources accessible and affordable, we squander that privilege away.

The first death came in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on Jan. 9. It took 83 days for the first 50,000 deaths to be recorded and just eight more for the toll to climb to 100,000.
The toll has been accelerating at a daily rate of between 6% and 10% over the past week, and there were almost 7,300 deaths globally reported on Thursday.
The death toll now compares with that of London’s Great Plague in the mid-1660s, which killed an estimated 100,000 people, about a third of the city’s population at the time.
But it is still far short of the so-called Spanish flu, which began in 1918 and is estimated to have killed more than 20 million people by the time it petered out in 1920.
The novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged in a Wuhan market where wild animals were sold late last year. It quickly spread through China and around the world.
Much remains to be determined about it, including just how lethal it is. Estimates vary widely.
Friday’s figures - 100,000 deaths of out 1.6 million cases - would suggest a fatality rate of 6.25% but many experts believe the actual rate is lower given that many mild and asymptomatic cases, when infected people don’t show symptoms, are not included in case totals.
Some countries, including Italy, France, Algeria, the Netherlands, Spain and Britain are reporting that more than 10% of all confirmed cases have been fatal.
One of the largest studies of the fatality of the disease, involving 44,000 patients in China, put the rate at about 2.9%.
The same study reported that 93% of recorded fatalities were people over the age of 50, and more than half were over 70.
Despite that, there are growing numbers of young adults and teenagers included in the global toll.
While North America now accounts for more than 30% of cases, Europe has reported a disproportionate number of fatalities, as countries with older populations like Spain and Italy have been severely affected.
Southern Europe alone accounts for more than a third of global deaths, despite recording just 20% of cases."

When we are young, we mostly make friends through school. As adults, making friends can be harder, although many people make friends through their work. It takes time. It is very natural to feel alone in a new place, so I hope you will not feel too discouraged too soon. There can be lots of opportunities for you to explore the people and place you moved to after the coronavirus lockdown eases in a month or two.

If by the middle of summer you are still in despair, consider taking a college class at the local university or community college, or enrolling part-time. Some classes could give you a place to focus your energy and feel concretely like you are being productive and working to build the better life you want. Moreover, it would be a really good way to meet people in your new city. People early in college tend to be especially open and inclined to make new friends, and you could find yourself quickly part of a community."

Look at it this way: a dude exchanges some messages with a woman on tinder, and they decide to meet up (he hopes she's not fat or a dude catfishing him). Dude gets to the club, then the woman messages him that she's not coming. Do you really think he'd be in the wrong for just enjoying his night out, and trying to salvage it by finding someone else to hook up with? Because that is the same damn situation. Now imagine this woman who *he's never met* and who bailed on HIM up starts messaging him that he sucks, he's a manbaby, an asshole, and she hopes he gets coronavirus. You'd think, ""Thank God he didn't stick his dick in that crazy!"" Do you understand? Or would you say she was right to be upset, because he should have ""stayed true"" and gone home?"

Federal aid for FIU students

 

On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Education provided guidance to universities for the distribution of emergency cash grants to college students whose lives and educations have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. These grants will be funded by a $13 billion Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund created by the recently passed CARES Act. The grants will provide emergency funds for students, including eligible expenses under a student’s cost of attendance, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and childcare.

 

At FIU, we are currently working on a plan and application process for students to access these grants. Please look for details by the end of next week."
2020-04-12,HoleinEagle,unpopularopinion,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fzq2hs/teachers_who_call_out_students_that_are_sleeping/fn5kab1/,"This seems odd. So rather than say, talk to the teacher beforehand ro alleviate confusion, you say, let the student, who full well knowingly need sleep, go to sleep and to potentially disturb the class (snoring, moving around, talking in sleep,etc.) THEN talk to the teacher (who could now be agitated, angry) for what the student did and say they're a victim (to some extent) to insomnia? 

The proper thing to do is to talk to the teacher regarding any issues before class. You don't fix a problem after you purposely create it. You plan and mitigate the problem before it becomes one. 

We're not supposed to fix problems that we know will happen. 
We're supposed to prevent problems that we know will happen. 

Effectively dealing with a potential problem beforehand is the most sensible thing to do. Not only does doing this before class starts tell the teacher that you don't mean to sleep in class (which gains even more favor from the teacher) but it actively shows the teacher that you have concerns around you. 

It's like the coronavirus. We knew the problem, we saw it months ahead, we had multiple reports, and we let disaster happen first before we acted. That should be an example of NOT reacting to a problem but rather, prevent the problem (or lessen the problem) before it occurs. And you can only do that before class (in regards to your example/post). Not after.

Because as soon as you create that problem, the teacher will have no reason to believe you. Remember, teachers have heard and seen most if not all excuses in the world. Showing that you care/are aware that you're falling asleep before class to the teacher will often have the teacher try to prevent the problem (of sleeping) from ocurring by actually helping the student. *If they are good teachers."

What you can do is damage it so it can't effectively interact with and 'infect' cells and then scrub it off.

Johnson was admitted to St Thomas'' Hospital on Sunday, on the advice of his doctor, after continuing to have a cough and high temperature 10 days after testing positive for the virus, the BBC reported.
The Prime Minister was given oxygen before being taken to intensive care on Monday.
The spokesman said that Johnson was in ""good spirits"" on Wednesday as he continued to receive standard oxygen treatment.
He was breathing without any assistance, such as mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support.
The spokesman added that he was not working but could contact those he needed to.
The Queen and other senior royals sent messages to Johnson''s family and his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, saying they were thinking of them, and wished the Prime Minister a full and speedy recovery.
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, said on Tuesday he was ""confident"" the PM would recover from this illness, describing him as a ""fighter"", the BBC reported.
The news of Johnson''s improvement comes as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK increased to 61,474 as of Wednesday, with death toll now standing at 7,097.
On Wednesday, the Downing Street said a review of lockdown rules would go ahead next week, but the public must ""stick with"" the measures at what was a ""critical time"".
A ban on public gatherings of more than two people and the closure of shops selling non-essential goods were among the series of restrictions announced by Johnson on March 23 to tackle the spread of coronavirus.
Downing Street said a relaxation of the rules would be considered ""on or around"" the three-week mark on April 13.
According to the government''s coronavirus legislation, the health secretary must review the need for restrictions at least once every 21 days, with the first review to be carried out by April 16.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told the BBC: ""I think we''re nowhere near lifting the lockdown.
""We think the peak - which is the worst part of the virus - is still probably a week and a half away."""

Actually, this “pond” is a stormwater retention pond that’s one of many low impact development (LID) methods. The intent is to capture stormwater and to reduce the peak flow rate of stormwater runoff into the downstream water course. Ironically the concept is exactly the same as the “flatten the curve” to allow our system to handle the coronavirus. If we can retain a certain volume of stormwater and prevent it or slow it from immediately hitting the downstream water ways, then it will reduce the stormwater peak flow curve ([hydrograph](https://riverfriends.org/wp-content/uploads/LID%20Hydrograph.jpg) ) such that the peak flow in the river will be lower and the that peak will be delayed. This helps minimizes flooding events. Also retaining water in this way pretreats the stormwater before it hits the natural system so that we’re reducing the amount of contaminants we introduce. One of the drivers for this retention pond is that nearly all new developments need to include LID features or similar methods such that the post-development peak runoff is the same as the pre-development condition. (Adding impervious surfaces increases the peak flow.) There’s much more to it but that’s the highlights."

My psychiatrist dubbed it “schoolphobia.” I had to drop out of high school. I went on to get my diploma and an associate degree from my community college, but I’m 24 now and still working on a four year degree. I just can’t get myself to show up and attend class. I can’t hold a job, even if I enjoy it, simply because I get too anxious and call out all the time. I have SEVERE panic attacks from it. I am looking to start trying again at the university degree once the coronavirus/online school thing ends, but I don’t know how I will ever be able to work this problem out. I am finally diagnosed as bipolar and on meds that actually help me, so I’m really hoping this time will be different."

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

The first death came in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on Jan. 9. It took 83 days for the first 50,000 deaths to be recorded and just eight more for the toll to climb to 100,000.
The toll has been accelerating at a daily rate of between 6% and 10% over the past week, and there were almost 7,300 deaths globally reported on Thursday.
The death toll now compares with that of London’s Great Plague in the mid-1660s, which killed an estimated 100,000 people, about a third of the city’s population at the time.
But it is still far short of the so-called Spanish flu, which began in 1918 and is estimated to have killed more than 20 million people by the time it petered out in 1920.
The novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged in a Wuhan market where wild animals were sold late last year. It quickly spread through China and around the world.
Much remains to be determined about it, including just how lethal it is. Estimates vary widely.
Friday’s figures - 100,000 deaths of out 1.6 million cases - would suggest a fatality rate of 6.25% but many experts believe the actual rate is lower given that many mild and asymptomatic cases, when infected people don’t show symptoms, are not included in case totals.
Some countries, including Italy, France, Algeria, the Netherlands, Spain and Britain are reporting that more than 10% of all confirmed cases have been fatal.
One of the largest studies of the fatality of the disease, involving 44,000 patients in China, put the rate at about 2.9%.
The same study reported that 93% of recorded fatalities were people over the age of 50, and more than half were over 70.
Despite that, there are growing numbers of young adults and teenagers included in the global toll.
While North America now accounts for more than 30% of cases, Europe has reported a disproportionate number of fatalities, as countries with older populations like Spain and Italy have been severely affected.
Southern Europe alone accounts for more than a third of global deaths, despite recording just 20% of cases."

We have the strictest entry policies, we're on another continent, the only way coronavirus should have come is through illegal immigration!

India's Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov held a telephonic conversation on Thursday to discuss the evolving situation related to the spread of the deadly virus.
Both of them exchanged notes on the national efforts underway in their respective countries to contain the outbreak of Covid-19.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the issue through a teleconference last month on March 25.
Shringla and Morgulov stressed on the close bilateral cooperation between the two countries in ensuring the welfare of each other''s citizens in their respective countries. There are around 15,000 Indian students in Russia and about 5,000 Russian tourists in India. Morgulov also thanked Shringla for facilitating the evacuation of Russian nationals from India.
Referring to the Russian chairmanship of BRICS and SCO, Morgulov informed Shringla of various preparatory meetings which would continue to take place through video conferencing in the coming days.
The telephonic discussion between Shringla and Morgulov came two days after India, in view of the humanitarian aspects of the pandemic, decided to lift the ban on the export of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). HCQ is being used to treat Covid-19 patients and as prophylactic by the frontline healthcare workers deployed in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The Modi government had imposed a ban on export of the drug since the coronavirus outbreak hit India.
The government is now licencing paracetamol and HCQ in appropriate quantities to neighbouring countries which are dependent on Indian capabilities and also supplying the drugs to the US and some other nations badly affected by the pandemic.
Russia as of now has over 10,000 Covid-19 positive cases while 76 people have succumbed to the dreaded virus. In India, 186 people have died so far while over 6,200 persons have tested positive for Covid-19."

During the afternoon session, market further strengthened on back of expectations of second stimulus package estimated at around Rs 1 lakh crore and focus on helping small and medium businesses, which led to both broad-based buying and also triggered some short covering, he added.
A Bank of America Securities report said the Centre may soon announce another fiscal package which may be almost similar to the Rs 1.75 lakh crore stimulus unveiled last month.

City officials bartered with manufacturer Pharmtech Inc. of San Diego, California, to cut a minimum order from 20,000 kits to 5,000 and to keep the unit cost at $25 for a total of $125,000.

“We will be sending a cashier’s check on Monday and we should receive the tests Friday,” Mayor Steve Clifford said.

Even after a unanimous vote by City Council on Thursday to spend $510,000, Clifford said many councilors were concerned about tying up that much money.

“I feel much better writing a $125,000 check, and I know council members were concerned about spending that much money during a time of uncertainty,” Clifford said.

The mayor said the city would begin testing the most pressing people like first responders, medical workers and the 250 people on the health department’s quarantine list before planning a drive-thru testing site at a later time.

Interim City Manager Gene Anderson called off an earlier purchase of 20,000 kits earlier in the day Friday when the distributor could not guarantee a delivery date.

“We were told it would take five to 10 business days to receive the tests, which sounds to me like two weeks or more,” Clifford said then. “That’s just not acceptable.”

With an initial 5,000 kits and a prospect of purchasing more as needed, the city could be among the first communities in the nation to provide mass antibody testing.

Both Clifford and former mayor Dr. A.J. Hashmi hinted at such during the Thursday council meeting.

“No other city has done it, and I think we will make history by saying we have offered testing to all our residents,” Hashmi said.

Clifford agreed, saying the city has tried to stay ahead of the curve in coronavirus prevention measures.

“I think we have done a great job here in Paris,” Clifford said. “We could be ahead of the curve again. We could be on top of this, and we could put Paris, Texas, in the forefront. We could create some data that could be used nationally as well.”

News reports on antibody testing flooded national news reports early Friday morning.

“Health departments, hospitals and companies around the world are rolling out the next wave in coronavirus testing, which looks in a person’s blood for signs of past infection,” The Wall Street Journal reported at 10 a.m.

“The new tests promise to give public health and hospital officials a better idea of how widely the new coronavirus has spread and who can safely treat patients and stop social distancing,” the Journal reported.

Just as Clifford and Hasmi told city councilors Thursday, the Journal explained how antibody testing works. A serology test looks in a person’s blood for antibodies, immune proteins developed to help fight off future infections. The presence of coronavirus antibodies indicates that a person has been exposed and developed some level of immune response, the report said.

“The information could reveal how many have been infected already and how many would potentially be susceptible to future infection,” the article states, “data that public-health authorities could use to better understand and respond to the pandemic.”

Thursday’s motion passed after councilors spent roughly an hour and a half in discussion about the reliability of the company providing the tests as well as whether tests should be offered to both Paris and Lamar County residents.

Clifford and Hashmi provided information about how mass testing might be handled. Rather than a nose swab, the test requires a finger stick, costs $25 with results available within 10 minutes, said Clifford, who likened the test to a pregnancy test.

At a mass testing site, probably Paris High School, cars would pass through a check-in point, proceed to testing and stick out an arm for a finger stick, pull forward and wait for results.

Pre-registration would be required with the Paris-Lamar County Health District, which would be responsible for registrations and record keeping, according to Anderson.

The tests reveal if a person has antibodies that are present at the beginning of the virus as well as a different type antibody that is present toward the end of the virus when a person is no longer contagious and possibly could donate blood for use in treating infected patients, Hashmi said.

“We would find the people walking around shedding the virus and get them quarantined,” Clifford said. “We could immediately test those we have quarantined.”"

Meanwhile, state-owned SBI, which has the highest number of PMJDY accounts, asked the beneficiaries not to believe in rumours that the money will be taken away by the government if not withdrawn amid large numbers of people flocking banks.
As a result of this, there are rush at bank branches leading to violation of social distancing guidelines to check the spread of coronavirus.
The Department of Financial Services (DFS) in a tweet said the government has deposited Rs 500 in the PMJDY accounts held by women for April and beneficiaries could withdraw it ""any time"".
""This amount (Rs 500) has reached your bank account and you can withdraw it any time,"" it said, and added Rs 500 will also be deposited during May as well in June.
The DFS, in the finance ministry, also asked the beneficiaries not to believe in rumours and withdraw the amount from ATM, customer service point or banks as per their convenience.
Of the total 38.08 crore accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), as many as 20.60 crore were held by women. As on April 1, the deposits in the PMJDY accounts stood at over Rs 1.19 lakh crore.
State Bank of India (SBI) further said, ""We would like to assure our customers that the funds in your account will not be blocked or returned to the government.""
The country's largest lender also asked the PMJDY account holders to withdraw money at their convenience anytime.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced this as part of the Rs 1.70-lakh crore relief package announced last month.
The minister had said as many as 20.5 crore women Jan Dhan account holders will get Rs 500 per month for next three months to run their households, a move aimed at mitigating the hardships caused by the lockdown."

H5N1 viral-engineering dangers will not go away

Governments, funders and regulatory authorities must urgently address the risks posed by gain-of-function research, says Simon Wain-Hobson.

27 March 2013

Barely two months after a small group of influenza virologists lifted a moratorium on work to make the H5N1 avian flu virus as transmissible between humans as seasonal flu, researchers are at it again. Earlier this month, a Dutch scientist proposed similar experiments with other avian flu viruses, as well as the SARS coronavirus. And a fortnight ago, scientists in Germany and Switzerland reported how they had tweaked canine distemper virus to make it grow in human cells.

The logic behind these kinds of experiments, collectively called gain-of-function (GOF) research, is to identify combinations of mutations that could allow an animal virus to jump to unprepared humans. By knowing the mutations, the thinking goes, we can better prepare and marshal our scientific defences against a possible threat.

Work resumes on lethal flu strains

H5N1 virus: Transmission studies resume for avian flu

GOF research on avian flu provoked heated controversy, much of it covered by this journal. That controversy did not go away with the lifting of the moratorium. On the contrary, it continues to fester. Officials in Washington DC are putting the finishing touches to new guidelines for the review, regulation and oversight of this kind of research. The chill winds that we can anticipate blowing from policy-makers as a result could affect all of us who research viruses and their pathology. To avoid this, researchers in this field need to learn lessons from the past.

Rather than use the avian flu moratorium to seek advice, listen and foster debate, many influenza scientists engaged in an academic exercise of self-justification. There was a single large open meeting, at the Royal Society in London, which engaged a wider audience, including bioethicists. The recent calling off of the moratorium by 40 flu researchers alone — not funders, governments or international bodies — says it all. The flu community simply hasn't understood that this is a hot-button issue that will not go away.

There are parallels here to my own field of HIV. In the early days of research, HIV scientists, buoyed by huge research monies, exuded hubris, promised a vaccine within two years, and all sorts of other things. The crunch came when they realized that they had to engage seriously with patient groups. The result is that HIV patients became the most faithful collaborators of HIV clinicians. It is too easy for scientists in a field to dismiss criticism and ideas from outside.

Here are the issues that must be openly addressed about GOF work with avian flu, the SARS coronavirus — or any other virus.

“Influenza virologists are going down a blind alley and the powers that be are blindly letting them go down that alley.”

First, is the virological basis for the work sound? The outcomes of the H5N1 experiments are dominated by the artificial-selection systems used. If aerosol-transmitted virus is systematically passaged from ferrets with severe respiratory distress, then the research teams will end up with a transmissible and highly virulent strain. Likewise, if animals with mild symptoms are chosen, a transmissible virus of low virulence would ultimately emerge. Whether nature will take any of these courses is unknown. Take dog breeding. Ruthless selection of alleles over a short period has produced phenomenal phenotypic variation — dachshunds, salukis, whippets and setters. Would nature have come up with the dachshund?

Second, infectious-disease researchers are fond of saying that microbes do not respect barriers. So who makes the rules and provides oversight? Barely a sound has emerged at the international level. The World Health Organization has held essentially closed-door meetings and has failed singularly to widen the debate.

Third, what if these groups generate a highly pathogenic and transmissible virus — which I suspect, within two years, they will? Then what? Should the virus be shared? Should research on this novel virus strain of catastrophic potential be highly restricted?

Fourth, what if there were a leak or a small outbreak? Crippling lawsuits would follow. Are the academic institutions sufficiently covered in terms of insurance? Are university regents or chancellors even aware of the power, and dangers, of the modern molecular biology going on in their labs? Again, not a word has emerged.

Fifth, the world has never been more densely populated. Is it appropriate for civilian scientists to make microbes more dangerous? Is creating a novel human virus antisocial? Was there a failure of duty on the part of funders and regulators? What is the ethical position on such work? Here there has been a start, but as yet there is no consensus.

The global ramifications of GOF research have simply not been sufficiently explored and discussed. Influenza virologists are going down a blind alley and the powers that be are blindly letting them go down that alley, which is tantamount to acquiescing. So let's be clear: the end game could be viruses more dangerous than the Spanish flu strain.

H5N1 GOF work — indeed all virological GOF work — should be suspended until virologists open up and engage in public discussion of their work and the issues it raises. Given that the flu community failed utterly to use the year-long hiatus to good effect, it is clear that an independent risk–benefit assessment of GOF work is needed.

Governments, funders and regulatory authorities should encourage the influenza virologists to listen and discuss. Learned societies should get off the fence and speak out. A conference involving all the stakeholders is needed, as happened at Asilomar in the 1970s for recombinant DNA. The problem will not go away. It has to be engaged and it has to be done now.

[Out of \~200 countries, US is #15 in terms of death toll per capita. Germany is #22 (again, out of all countries). Almost all of the countries with higher death rates than the US are in Europe.](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) Unless you ignore population, in which case sure, countries with far higher populations will often have more bad things than small countries, and more good things than small countries. Per capita is the way to compare.
2. The highest death rate in the world is San Marino in Europe, which was rated as one of the top healthcare systems in Europe. #2 death rate is Spain, which is one of the rare single payer universal healthcare systems in the world. #3 death rate is Andorra in Europe, which was previously ranked as the best healthcare system in the world by the Lancet. #4 death rate is Italy, which was previously ranked as 2nd best healthcare system in the world by the WHO. A number of other countries in Europe all have higher death rates than the US, including the UK, which is another of the rare single payer universal healthcare systems in the world. So maybe the original argument about deaths vs. healthcare systems isn't so immediately obvious?

It's been slowing down the past few years. Labor isn't as cheap in China, so companies have moved to cheaper places like Vietnam and Cambodia. The coronavirus is now a PR nightmare for the CCP, and countries are starting to decouple from China. China is an export-led economy, and every country now dealing with coronavirus is buying less from China, so it's having a real effect on the companies there. There are no unemployment benefits in China either. The government will tell the companies to just keep them employed with no pay. 

People and businesses are in massive debt from shadow banking, and the government is too. The middle income trap is really happening to China. Plus, the more authoritarian rule is making the people really angry, so the government has to clamp down harder in dissent. It's a threat to their rule. 

If you have connections and can get a job in the high tech sector, then go for it, but unfortunately most of the economy isn't doing well."

>As you all might know Italy is on the verge of bankruptcy ""due to coronavirus"".

>But on another subreddit I have argued that coronavirus is just the catalyst of our current disgrace, not the cause.

There's probably a name for this error.  It takes the immediate problem and dismisses its relevance while claiming that something else which isn't an immediate problem is.

Thence it recasts the current PM who has worked under both left-wing and right-wing parliament as a 'communist.'

>He was reappointed as prime minister of his second cabinet on 5 September. Conte became the first person in the history of the Italian Republic to lead governments in the same legislature with both right-wing and left-wing coalition partners.

In the US we look at the word 'communist' as 'fight'en words.  The use of that term is relegated to the Joe McCCarthy's who we have to ask ""have you any decency sir"" to.  Worse, while it may suit some Italiains better, it does not appear to be an accurate portrayal.

Why portray?  Just to get upvotes here where no one really knows who he is and thus can't argue the point? Or if they do are likely to get speared in this space?

If 200 downvotes is some red badge of courage consider that the honest thing to do would be to admit that its at BEST debatable whether Giuseppe Conte is any kind of radical at all.  

What I would suggest is - rather than try to fight some good fight over bad feelings about Conte, try to win the war against the virus first."

It's not about who created it, or giving nationality to a virus, it's about the *geographic origin* from where it started spreading human to human. And Mainland's government  silenced early whistleblowers (where's Dr. Ai Fen?) and allowing wet markets to continue, not learning anything from SARS. Look at South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, they reacted IMMEDIATELY because they all experienced either SARS or MERS. Mainland china, while they did react appropriately until later in January (not as early as Taiwan of course), where SARS and covid19 emerged, just continued letting wet markets go on despite multiple warnings from chinese scientists studying novel coronaviruses in bats. What's most horrifying of all is that they're still going on/will resume despite the current pandemic. 

Maybe if someone slapped some Free Hong Kong/Tibet/Uyghur stickers on pangolin and bat cages, will they finally shut it down, because they care more about political enemies than viruses that can wipe out humanity. Saving face > saving lives. 

And for the record, almost all news media already calls it ""coronavirus"".

Because of people coming up from the valley/bay area, our small town is now a corona hot spot and is 9x times hotter per capita than the rest of California. Our hospital is small, already struggling with capacity as we ship most of our cases down to Reno. Currently, there are about 48 people hospitalized (we know nurses who work there) and over half are non-locals. Our grocery stores are impacted and we do not have the summer employee levels as this is the off season. 

I know many local business owners who are struggling hard in these times including my own family. The longer this corona situation goes on, the longer our business owners have to close down and suffer. People coming up, overwhelming our resources just because they want an ""isolation vacation"" is not helping anyone. It is incredibly selfish and prolongs the pandemic. The point is to end this virus situation. Going out of your own communities is the last thing you should be doing. 

If you feel cabin fever, go somewhere closer to home and just for the day. It's hard, I get it, but what's harder is seeing my town close down business doors and shelves empty because somebody thought it would be ""nice"" to quarantine in their vacation home.

As of mid-March 2020, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a more moderate impact in Taiwan than in many neighboring countries, with relatively few infections overall. The first case was announced on 21 January 2020. 

The Taiwanese government integrated data from the national healthcare system, immigration, and customs authorities to aid in the identification and response to the virus. Government efforts are coordinated through the National Health Command Center (NHCC) of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, established to aid in disaster management for epidemics following the 2004 SARS outbreak.The Journal of the American Medical Association states that Taiwan engaged in 124 discrete action items to prevent the spread of the disease, including early screening of flights from Mainland China and the tracking of individual cases.Taiwan's handling of the outbreak has received international praise for its effectiveness in quarantining the people and by using the ""electronic fence"" to slow down the virus, despite being unable to gather WHO information due to being barred by China, and is seen as the model for other countries to learn from.

You will generally save money from buying a home if you have the cash to fund yourself. Secondly, be patient right now interest rates are super low due to the coronavirus so taking out a mortgage might look nice right now but you have to also expect that your repayments on that mortgage won't be the same now as in 1-3 years time (potentially look at the avg mortgage repayment when inflation is high in the area you live.)

Additionally, I don't know the pricing as I am from Australia so take what I say with a grain of salt. However, if you are living in an area where you can purchase a place for around 400k-600k with an extra bedroom its definitely possible.

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

IF we're all gonna get it anyway, why draw it out? And then you learn about flattening the curve, how we have limited capacity of healthcare, beds, ventilators...

So when did he ask it? the article just says ""In March."" 

But in the original Washington Post article:

>During one task force meeting in the Situation Room last month, Trump turned to Fauci and challenged him.

>**It was the day the administration was adding Ireland and the United Kingdom to its travel restrictions,** and Trump wanted to understand why talk of “herd immunity” — allowing the coronavirus to sweep a nation largely unchecked, with the belief that those who survived would then be immune — was such a bad idea.

>“Why don’t we let this wash over the country?” Trump asked, according to two people familiar with his comments, a question other administration officials say he has raised repeatedly in the Oval Office.


The US added Ireland and UK to the travel restrictions on March 14th. 

So think back, at what point had you learned enough to know about flattening the curve? Was it before March 14th? 

March 11th was the day the NBA suspended everything after Rudy Gobert tested positive. 

Here's an article from February 29th: https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/02/29/covid-19-is-now-in-50-countries-and-things-will-get-worse

>With SARS-CoV-2 now spread around the world, the aim of public-health policy, whether at the city, national or global scale, is to flatten the curve, spreading the infections out over time.

along with this graphic: https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1316/85/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200229_FBC978.png

So Italy is in full-blown lockdown for more than a week, then in the US colleges are shutting down, the NBA shuts down, March Madness is cancelled...two days after March Madness is cancelled, Trump is in the situation room asking a question that shows he still doesn't understand ""flatten the curve."" 

And it says he has asked the question repeatedly. So he's had it explained to him multiple times and yet he still can't understand it, or he's just waiting for a yes-man to give him an answer he likes better and call him smart for coming up with a brilliant idea (member when he just floated nuking hurricanes as an idea?).

So remember this when people try to claim that this was going to be bad no matter who was president. Remember we had an idiot president who had all the resources and experts in the world trying to talk sense to him and he didn't want to hear it."

À época, admitia que as duas leituras eram possíveis.

 Penso que hoje já é possível responder à questão de forma mais assertiva e concluir, quase definitivamente, que Bolsonaro é burro mesmo. Uma guerra ou pandemia (os efeitos políticos são parecidos) é o sonho de consumo de líderes em dificuldades. Elas oferecem o pretexto ideal para o governante evocar o discurso da união nacional e surfar na subsequente onda de popularidade.

 Não é uma coincidência que regimes moribundos frequentemente provoquem um conflito armado para tentar legitimar-se pela guerra, como fizeram os generais argentinos nas Malvinas em 1982. Não deu certo porque perderam no teatro militar, mas praticamente toda a oposição cerrou fileiras com os ditadores.

 Levantamento do [site The Brazilian ](https://brazilian.report/coronavirus-brazil-live-blog/2020/04/05/poll-brazilians-want-jair-bolsonaro-resign-covid-19-crisis/)[Report](https://brazilian.report/coronavirus-brazil-live-blog/2020/04/05/poll-brazilians-want-jair-bolsonaro-resign-covid-19-crisis/) feito em oito países mostrou que Bolsonaro e o presidente mexicano, que também flertava com o negacionismo, foram os únicos que não experimentaram aumento de aprovação por causa da Covid-19. Mesmo dirigentes de nações que lidam com pilhas de cadáveres, como a Itália e os EUA, recuperaram popularidade.

 Mais, a epidemia é um tipo de crise que faz com que políticos que não tenham cargos públicos praticamente desapareçam. Foi o caso de Joe Biden nos EUA. A figura que cresceu ali foi a do governador de Nova York, Andrew Cuomo. Aqui no Brasil, Luciano Huck se apaga, enquanto ganham visibilidade Doria, Witzel, Maia e Mandetta.

  A menos que [Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/bolsonaro-minimiza-popularidade-na-crise-e-chama-de-impatriotica-pergunta-sobre-datafolha.shtml) tenha acesso a conhecimentos privilegiados sobre a Covid-19, ele está cavando sua própria sepultura política, atitude incompatível com inteligência."

Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital on Sunday evening with a persistent high temperature and cough, and was rushed to intensive care on Monday where he spent three nights receiving treatment.
“The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery,” a spokesman from his office said in an emailed statement. 
Johnson was the first world leader to be hospitalised with the coronavirus, forcing him to hand control of the world’s fifth-largest economy to foreign minister Dominic Raab just as Britain’s outbreak approaches its most deadly peak.
Raab tweeted that the improvement in Johnson’s condition was “the news we all wanted to hear”. U.S. President Donald Trump described it as “great news”.
The United Kingdom is entering what scientists say is the deadliest phase of the outbreak, with deaths expected to continue to rise over the Easter weekend.
But in a sign the shutdown measures were working, health officials have said the number of coronavirus infections and hospital admissions had begun to show signs of flattening.
Police said they would be taking tougher action to do just that before the four-day Easter holiday weekend because many people were continuing to ignore the ban on social gatherings.

2020-04-12,teen_burger_combo,trump,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/fu6oo5/so_easy_to_find_happiness/fn5nsxd/,"> You without a doubt did equate them citing news sources as proof everyone downplayed the seriousness of it. It's up there in your comments. You need to start reading your own statements. You argued that if others did it, why does it matter the POTUS did? 

I do read my own statements, you have a history of neither reading mine nor your own.  Read my previous post, which concisely summarized the argument:

> In response to your claim that the ""press called out his ass"", I said ""The press, like the Democrats, kept saying this was nothing and Trump was overhyping it even into March."", to which you said **""No, that was fucking Trump and his base of uneducated hicks saying it was nothing. They were mocking the media and the democrats for thinking it was something.""** I then pointed out how EVERYONE downplayed this and even said ""The Democrats, the Republicans, and the media all downplayed this."" I provided sources for how the Democrats continued to downplay it and you ignored them.

The Democrats downplayed this and I gave the following  examples:

- Pelosi telling people on Feb 24 to come celebrate as a group in Chinatown -- ""We want to be vigilant about what is out there in other places. We want to be careful about how we deal with it, but we do want to say to people 'Come to Chinatown, here we are — we're, again, careful, safe — and come join us.'""
- DeBlasio and NYC continuously downplaying the Coronavirus
- Eric Garcetti continuing the LA Marathon on Mar 9

Plenty more can be found because, once again, EVERYONE downplayed this!

> Yeah, your sources were the fucking news! The POTUS should be above everyone but you seem incapable of admitting he did anything wrong. 

You're unable to follow an argument.  I said EVERYONE downplayed this.  I'm not giving a pass to anyone on the downplaying.  I am pointing out both the domestic and the international responses were insufficient.  

> You Trumpets are like little worshippers and it is disturbing. That fact mixed with wanting one type of person out of the country is why you're so often compared to the Nazi party. That and the racism at your rallies but that's another story.

You keep insulting and ranting, typically with blatant lies and propaganda.  I'm not worshiping anyone here.  I'm pointing out facts and you are presenting a warped perspective of myself.

> Obama had way more tragedies to deal with that required the use of them. Trump had next to none for the first 4 years. He did nothing. Obama always had some ready and actually handled it before it got out of hand.

What do you mean Obama ""always had some ready""?  What are you arguing?

> I'm referring to Anthony Fauci who your friends over here are sending death threats to for whatever reason. The only seemingly competent one who takes facts over Trump.

I have no idea what you're referring to.  Sorry, I maybe missed a headline, but I have no knowledge of this.  Would you please share a link and explain your position?

> So 1. It was a downgrade that fucked us. 2. See 1 3. Trump was warned and had years. Not an excuse.

1) If that's the totality of your argument, then I'm sorry we will have to disagree.  I am following international responses , including WHO, and have to conclude USA is doing reasonably well, all things considered.

You and I both agree America could and should have been better prepared, but I'm believe government is inherently inefficient and reactive.  I have yet to see any real leadership from the Democrats; Cuomo is the best so far in my view.  I didn't see any action or support from the Democrats from January through to March.  I heard screeching from them and saw no action, no plans.  

Again, the pandemic response team released/approved a strategy for a flu outbreak in August 2018, the **National Biodefense Strategy**.  The CDC have been following this since January 2020.  It is insufficient, in part, because you can't prepare for all scenarios.  It is insufficient even more-so because it screwed up the testing kit deployment.  This had nothing to do with the White House or Congress.  No one blocked the CDC.  No Democrat or Republican or Independent is responsible for the CDC's missteps unless they actually impeded the CDC's efforts.  I have not seen any indication of that. 

I believe we both expect more from government.

I believe China is the reason the world is in this mess.  Their repeated lies and cover-up resulted in this pandemic.  

The wet markets need to be shut down globally.  They're disgusting breeding grounds for pathogens, support organized crime, and result in inhumane treatment of animals.

As for 3) Obama had years to restock the N95 and ventilators.  He was told by Bush to do it, he didn't.  He was told to do it by the NSC and he didn't.  Trump didn't, either.  They both screwed up.  

> As far as your governors mess up go, they have to ask the federal government for help and the fact you're implying they should be more prepared than the federal government is stupid. 

There are clear divisions of powers between the cities/states/feds.  The Federal Government acts as a support for the States.  The Federal Government provides support actions:
- Coordinated response via CDC/Congress
- Border restrictions
- Spending

States have the responsibilities of:
- Coordination of responses with the municipalities
- Healthcare
- Policing
- Spending

Cities have bylaws, coordination of responses, policing, and so on.  I think you can appreciate the plethora of failures in each responsibility.  Trump acted earlier than any Western nation.  The Chinese only told the world at the very end 

> Trump played some ""appreciate me or fuck you"" shit and it's pathetic.

No, you read fake news.  Here's the [video](https://www.c-span.org/video/?470753-1/president-trump-coronavirus-task-force-briefing&vod=)

He's listing off all the agencies that people should appreciated for their great work: 

""All I want them to do - very simple - I want them to be appreciative. I don't want them to say things that aren't true. I want them to be appreciative. We've done a great job. And I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about Mike Pence, the task force; I'm talking about FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers.There's no country in the world that could have done what the Army Corps of Engineers has done and is doing. Now they're going in and building - literally, they're going into hotels and renovating hotels. That should be for governors to do. That should be for states to do. We have the Army Corps of Engineers so teed up and so stocked up, and they're really psyched and they're incredible. And there's no games with these people. They're in there screaming, ""Get it done. Get it done."" There's not like sitting around, taking it easy. These are workers. These are incredible people.So I think the Army Corps of Engineers when - when somebody, for political reasons, wants to blame, I view that as blaming these incredible people. Nobody has ever seen it. I don't know if you've been to the Javits Center.""

I don't see any issue.

I never said that you did, perhaps you should learn to read. I said that high heat *can* denature proteins. The point regarding heat was that it could be and probably is effective, potentially independent of soap, I just don't know how hot stuff has to get to be sure.

Ante todo, fue el caudillo político de Entre Ríos, provincia que bajo su liderazgo se transformó en eje de la política nacional y tras la derrota de Rosas, en la base política del partido federal. Fue un **militar exitoso**, caracterizado por su capacidad de conducir con éxito la caballería entrerriana en diversas acciones militares, ocho de las cuales quedaron consagradas en espléndidos cuadros de Juan Manuel Blanes. Fue un **político habilidoso**, que supo tejer alianzas y superar antagonismos. Algo semejante tuvo en lo **diplomático**, estableciendo acuerdos tanto en la región, como con potencias extranjeras. Tuvo **una idea de progreso económico que puso en evidencia tanto en su gestión política como en su patrimonio personal**. Fue el primer presidente electo para el período 1854-1860, en la primera etapa del proceso conocido como “Organización Nacional”. Dio relevancia a la educación y el Colegio de Concepción del Uruguay que fundó no sólo apuntó a ilustrar a la juventud entrerriana, sino a la futura clase dirigente de toda la Confederación.

>  Tras vencer a Juan Manuel de Rosas en la batalla de Caseros, convoca a los gobernadores que lo habían acompañado para organizar el país, firmando lo que se llamó el “Acuerdo de San Nicolás” con ellos. En la larga puja entre la Confederación que él presidió y lideró y el Estado de Buenos Aires, que duró casi una década, tuvo el predominio militar, derrotando a las fuerzas porteñas, pero no suficiente fuerza para tomar la Ciudad Puerto y doblegarla. **Su retirada tras imponerse militarmente a Mitre en la batalla de Pavón fue una decisión política que buscaba poner fin a la guerra civil que venía desangrando al país durante las cuatro décadas precedentes**. Ahí empieza a ser visto como “traidor” por algunos de sus lugartenientes. En la Guerra del Paraguay, no acepta las propuestas de Alianza de Francisco Solano López y se mantiene leal al gobierno de su “enemigo” Bartolomé Mitre, aunque sin participar activamente. Evita verse comprometido con los levantamientos montoneros que tiene lugar en el noroeste del país durante dicha guerra. Trata de ser presidente en 1868, pero no reúne los electores suficientes. Tampoco los logra el candidato de Mitre, su canciller Rufino Elizalde. En esta circunstancia **se impone la candidatura de Domingo Faustino Sarmiento**, políticamente un militante de la casual porteña, pero sociológicamente un hombre del interior.

Second, cases in Africa are peanuts right now compared to the rest of the world, including China. It doesn't make sense to target them for the coronavirus alone, especially when some have been here the whole time.

Also, your response begs the question: is this what the US, Europe, etc. Should have done when things started to pick up in Wuhan to Chinese nationals abroad? I think no, there's a lot of ethical concerns. It's not any different for China."

This is my POV as someone who got very ill from H1Ni a few years ago. 

Most of these people will not acquire the virus, whether asymptomatic or symptomatic.    They'll go about their lives, making excuses for skirting the official directives because they are in the minority of people breaking a few rules. When the officials signal the 'all clear', some of them will be the first to rant on social channels about the perceived over-reaction--""I didn't change a thing about my lifestyle and never got sick. What a farce!"" 

Well, I'm just as active in the community as these people...at least when conditions are normal.  During quarantine, I could venture out every day in crowds and might have chance of acquiring it after 6 months of close contact with people. Problem is, I spent 4 weeks at Evergreen Hospital a few years ago with pneumonia from the H1Ni virus, including 3 days in ICU on oxygen, and still need a puff of Abuterol every morning to avoid wheezing through my work/home life. I'm in decent shape. I exercise every day. But I trust my care team, who said I probably won't survive another bout of pneumonia. 

Fair enough. My respiratory system isn't the same. COVID-19 would probably kill me.  All I can do is avoid anyone who might transmit any virus to me. Any virus. Flu or whatever novel Coronavirus hits our community. 

I wish I could find the article I recently read on this topic, but the gist is that those in decent health tend to feel immune to disease and maladies that they mistakenly attribute to poor life choices or unhealthy lifestyles. "" I ran 3 miles yesterday, so my immune system can handle anything"", ""I walked around the park today with my best friend,"" or 'I've been on Messenger with these people every day--we're all fine, no problem if we get together."" 

 Yeah, that's not the point.  

If you don't have a problem with a 'little, quick get-together' during quarantine--as if no one else is doing the same--you probably could give a shit about making weekly trips to Costco or Home Depot or wherever gives you the 'feels' of normal life. At least you've got your tulip bulps and Scott's Lawn Care turf builder for the Memorial Day party that should be fine if it's just a few friends.  

It's when you are super-healthy and end up flat on your back in acute respiratory shock that you realize you're not invincible. Everyone's fragile and susceptible to disease.  Everyone. 

Long rant, but all I can say is stick to the official word. People will only get more lackadaisical as the days get warmer. Until officials are certain risk is near zero, it's not worth the risk, whether for yourself or high-risk individuals like me."

2020-04-12,ggumdol,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fzmjr6/swedens_relaxed_approach_to_the_coronavirus_could/fn5oq3j/,"In a recent interview with BBC Newsnight (2020-04-01), the state epidemiologist, Anderst Tegnell, said:

\*\*\*""I don't think any can be seriously confident about getting this right...""\*\*\*

I suppose that he has not been sure about the circumstances at all and has been directing the Swedish government under the above assumption that the death rate will be probably around 0.05%-0.1% (10-40 times smaller than best current estimate) as indicated by another redditor here:

\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fzmjr6/swedens\\\_relaxed\\\_approach\\\_to\\\_the\\\_coronavirus\\\_could/fn50pk8?utm\\\_source=share&utm\\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fzmjr6/swedens\_relaxed\_approach\_to\_the\_coronavirus\_could/fn50pk8?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fzmjr6/swedens\_relaxed\_approach\_to\_the\_coronavirus\_could/fn50pk8?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fzmjr6/swedens_relaxed_approach_to_the_coronavirus_could/fn50pk8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x))

\[[http://www.openias.org/swedens-covid19-strategy](http://www.openias.org/swedens-covid19-strategy)\]([http://www.openias.org/swedens-covid19-strategy](http://www.openias.org/swedens-covid19-strategy))

because, when you are tasked with a problem seemingly impossible to solve, you tend to assume the best. That's not scientific but that is a natural human response. In the wake of imminent possibility of death, people naturally panick but, \*\*in his academic mind, he had a strong suspicion that this virus is not very different from a flu.\*\* This might sound like a cliche but lifelong academic experience indeed makes people more dogmatic because, in many cases, they are forced to solve problems with unrealistic (mathematical) assumptions \*\*for years\*\* due to the lack of the state-of-the-art techniques. It is academically valuable but sometimes their achievement is detached from the reality. Thus, it might have been easier for him to assume low death rate. Putting everything together, the above overly optimistic assumption on low death rate is dovetailing with the reason why he is recently citing statistics figure from SCB to convince Swedish people that ""\*\*Old people would have died, anyway. We don't will not so many deaths because it's not very dissmilar to a flu\*\*"".

I think that Anders Tegnell is now aware that the situation is ""gradually"" getting much more disastrous than he originally assumed. When a people is cornered into a completely untenable position, he starts to be focused on face saving and only hope that the situation turns out favourable to him. For him, it too late anyway to change the course."
2020-04-12,finndego,politics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fzk3vp/report_trump_privately_asks_why_government_cant/fn5ozvu/,"From the very same article: 

""Trump reportedly began mulling over the idea after hearing about the United Kingdom’s now-abandoned “mitigation” strategy that would let COVID-19 spread throughout the country with few movement restrictions imposed on the population in the hopes of building a “herd immunity” against the virus.

However, a [study](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) by medical advisers to the British government found in mid-March that the strategy would “likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths,” prompting the U.K. to drop the plan.""

It doesn't save lives in the long run. It kills them off in the short term. They've gone from 330 deaths to 887 in the last week and it is still trending up. The science community is not happy with the plan either.

If this effects mostly old people, then let them  stay inside. Most of them aren't working anyways.

Have you listened to Trump? All he does is ramble and repeat himself and throw out insults. He is a fountain of stupidity and incompetence. This is the same dude who believes that windmills cause cancer and didn't know that the flu killed people.

As it is, Biden's speech on his version of a coronavirus response was 100x better than anything Trump has said, including the lies that the president has told us over and over again. Remember, it was just six weeks ago that Trump was telling us that everything was OK, and look where we are now. How can you even trust his leadership when he hasn't shown any at all?

I used to defend this author a month ago against ""pop sci revision"" charges (then somewhat unfounded), but I think [this new article from them](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3079443/coronavirus-could-target-immune-system-targeting-protective) is pretty guilty of sensationalism, if not ""pop sci revision"":

>**Coronavirus could target immune system by targeting protective cells, warn scientists**  
>  
>*Researchers in China and the US find that the virus that causes Covid-19 can destroy the T cells that are supposed to protect the body from harmful invaders*  
>  
>*One doctor said concern is growing in medical circles that effect could be similar to HIV*

SCMP has a (bad) habit of not linking the papers or making it easy to find. Now, [I did manage to get a hold of the original paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR7) \- thankfully, since SCMP only mentions three names: two of the authors and the journal. And all is not as it seems:

>warn scientists

First, there's no warning anywhere, explicit or implicit, in the referenced paper. (Neither is there a comparison to HIV. Further on, it seems that this author appears to be crafting his own narrative...)

>*Researchers in China and the US...*

Misleading. There is only one author out of the ten that is associated with the US. And I say ""associated"" as it's not the only post he has:

>*Shibo Jiang*  
>  
>Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE/NHC/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai, China  
>  
>Lindsley F. Kimball Research Institute, New York Blood Center, New York, NY, USA

The rest are solely associated with Fudan University - same lab, same school, same text as above too. So, it would be more accurate to just say Fudan researchers...

>*One doctor said concern is growing in medical circles that effect could be similar to HIV*

You would think there's a compelling case to back this, and that it's not just hearsay. Turns out... it's just hearsay. This was all there was to back it up:

>A doctor, who works in a public hospital treating Covid-19 patients in Beijing, said the discovery added another piece of evidence to a growing concern in medical circles that the coronavirus could sometimes behave like some of the most notorious viruses that directly attack the human immune system.  
>  
>“More and more people compare it to HIV,” said the doctor who requested not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.

And the original paper doesn't mention HIV either... which makes me wonder why an HIV comparison is even here in the first place.

There's a comparison to MERS, but that's it - along with further evidence that it's *not* HIV, given SARS-CoV-2 apparently only enters the T-cells to do nothing. Consistent with MERS, but not HIV/AIDS:

>Given that MERS-CoV can efficiently infect, but not replicate, in T lymphocytes,[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR6) we further detected the number of viral genome copies at different time points post infection to explore the replication characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in MT-2 cells. Similar to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 failed to replicate in MT-2 cells (Fig. [1g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1)). The number of viral genome copies at 6 h was significantly higher than other time points in the cell lysate, but always remained steady at all time points in the supernatants. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may enter MT-2 cells at 6 h post infection, but does not replicate, and then the viral RNA degrade. In supernatants, the detected viral copies might be the background of the residual virions, similar to the results of the previous MERS-CoV study (Fig. [1g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#Fig1)).[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9#ref-CR6)

Thoughts on the ""concern is growing in medical circles"" and the one and only ""More and more people compare it to HIV"" line used to back it up? 

*(Given the SCMP author's track record in this article, and no HIV references in the paper, I'm inclined to think it's BS sensationalism. But at the same time, I don't think the original paper has been shared here yet. Also, the original paper* [got 23 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fxkdlk/sarscov2_infects_t_lymphocytes_through_its_spike/) *over at* r/COVID19*, but somehow this news article is* [picking up steam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fznbz7/coronavirus_could_target_immune_system_by_killing/) at \~90 upvotes in 5 hours *at* r/Coronavirus*)*"

It is certainly possible to develop the right vaccine for this (it doesn't take long to make any one vaccine - they could have it already), but knowing its efficacy for sure requires time and thorough testing. Up until now, the coronavirus outbreaks have subsided before testing was even complete, so interest in the projects dried up and they were abandoned. This may prove different. Who knows?"

Yes.  The current models show about 60,000 people will die from the virus.  Everything we are doing will on slow the spread of the virus.  There is nothing we can do to stop the spread.  All of our efforts, right now, will still result in the same number of people being infected with the same results.  This was never about stopping the spread, it was about lengthening the timeline so as to not overwhelm our medical systems."

It's no secret that she was publicly criticizing the federal government. In mid March she said:

>*On closing restaurants and bars, Whitmer said, “In order to flatten the  curve, we need to be aggressive on the front end.* ***The federal government  did not take this seriously early enough***, and now it is on us to make  sure we’re doing everything we can based on the best facts and science  available ***and that we are always putting the health of our people front  and center***.  It was a tough decision to make, but we know the spread of  this virus  is dependent on close proximity. This is one of many steps  we’re taking  in the state of Michigan.”

She also stated:

>*Whitmer said, “This has to be all hands on deck. Cutting red tape,* ***moving as quickly as we possibly can***, and ***being aggressive and smart  about our reaction***.

And:

>*We  need respirators and ventilators and personal protection equipment.  We  need more test kits and the resources to process those test kits* ***in a  quick, expedited manner***.”

And yet another:

>*Ruhle asked, “Can you get them? Can you get them without federal support?”*  
*Whitmer responded, “No, no.* ***We need federal support.*** *Like  I said,  we’re pulling out all of the stops and reaching out to our  partners in  the private sector and we’re going to do everything we can  to supplement  but* ***it’s not to the exclusion of federal support***\*.\* ***We need the federal  government to ramp up and get this done***.”

She's  saying all of this mid March. Do you know what she knows while she's  publicly thrashing the federal government for being slow and unprepared?  ***She knows that she hasn't even applied for it yet.***

And as of March 25, ***still hadn't applied for federal aid yet***.:

>*Michigan  has not yet requested a major disaster declaration for the   coronavirus, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency   said Wednesday. . .*  
*. . .Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, said Wednesday  morning that state officials were* ***""reviewing and looking into""*** *a request  to FEMA. By Wednesday afternoon, after the Free Press published a story  on the issue, Brown said officials were* ***""working urgently""*** *on a  disaster request.* ***She did not immediately respond to a question about  why the request was not completed sooner***.

That's  right. While she was making all of those accusations against the  President and the federal government, trying to make it sound like she  just working her ass off, ***she still hadn't even applied for aid yet.***

>*Tori  Sachs, executive director of the conservative  group Michigan Rising  Action, said it is ""unfortunate"" that Whitmer  ""didn't know that going  on cable news to blast the president won’t get  the state any federal  disaster resources* ***if the governor doesn’t submit a  request for the funds***.""  
*""****This is state emergency management 101****,"" Sachs said in a news release.* 

*Michigan's request for a disaster declaration came* [*one day after the Free Press revealed*](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/03/25/fema-michigan-disaster-declaration-coronavirus/5077623002/) *that* ***Michigan had not yet made a request to FEMA***, at a time when several other states had already had their requests granted.

So she ***finally*** filed for assistance ***on 3/26.***

*A freaking week ago*. All the while blaming it on the President and the federal government that the state of Michigan had no aid.

Political posturing. Trying to make herself look like a victim. All the while ***knowing full well that she hadn't even filed for aid***. Every interview she gave, every negative thing she said. Knowing the ***real*** truth.

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

2020-04-12,ofrm1,politics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fzpinr/joe_biden_wins_alaska_democratic_primary/fn5rr81/,">He only beat Bernie because the majority of the US isn't for democratic socialism.

Translation: ""He only beat Bernie because he ran a better campaign which appealed to more voters than him."" Yep. That's how that works.

Also, the person you're responding to was referring to the fact that Biden beat Sanders in the debate, not the primary.

>Biden literally can't handle a webchat let alone a debate

You keep deliberately ignoring the fact that Biden stomped Sanders in the debate. Watch the first 20 minutes of that debate where both candidates are asked about what they would do **right now** to stem the tide of Coronavirus. Biden's responses are clear, rational, and detailed. Meanwhile, Sanders' responses are vague with few concrete details. (Shut the president up, move aggressively, cover payments for medical visits, etc.) He later tries to launch into the same 2 minute stump speech about Medicare for all which Biden promptly shuts down.

The reason why he did so well in that debate is because it's more of a long-form debate where candidates are given much more time to respond in detail. When Biden is given enough time to explain his positions, he's becomes the same person that tore Palin and Ryan to shreds because he's a political veteran and has more experience than they did. The same is even more true for Sanders because Sanders is weakest when he has to give extemporaneous responses to questions that don't lend themselves to a rehearsed speech."

Here is a previous case that the landlord and tenant board ruled on. The tenant and landlord were in Waterloo, and it involved the tenant trying to terminate a 3 year lease early before the termination date. kw4rent makes students sign 3 year leases, so this might be relevant to you. Anyways, the tenant in this scenario should have notified the landlord in January if they wanted to terminate the lease as of August that same year, but failed to do so. They then want to cancel their tenancy using the ""60 day rule"", but the landlord refused to terminate the lease. The landlord and tenant board actually ruled in the landlord's favour, citing the fact that the tenant signed a 3 year lease and that it was the tenant's fault for not respecting the termination clause deadline. So whoever pointed out the ""60 day rule"" below is incorrect.

Here are the key summary findings from the case:

The Tenant signed a 3 year lease agreement with the ability for early termination subject to the stipulations set out in the lease.  In para (3) of the lease, the Tenant could terminate the tenancy early if they gave notice on or before January 15, 2016 for termination August 27, 2016.  The Tenant stated that she missed the deadline and became upset as she was going to be finished school the end of August 2016.  She asked J.R. to intervene.

The 60 day notice that the Tenant provided on June 30, 2016 is not in compliance with what the parties agreed to when in the lease agreement nor is it in compliance with the s.44(4).  Although the [Act](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-2006-c-17/latest/so-2006-c-17.html) requires 60 day notice at the end of a term, I find that the Tenant entered into a lease agreement for a term commencing September 3rd 2014 and ending August 27, 2017 and that pursuant to [*s. 44(4)*](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-2006-c-17/latest/so-2006-c-17.html#sec44subsec4_smooth) *A notice under* [*section 47*](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-2006-c-17/latest/so-2006-c-17.html#sec47_smooth)*,* [*58*](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-2006-c-17/latest/so-2006-c-17.html#sec58_smooth) *or*[ *144*](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-2006-c-17/latest/so-2006-c-17.html#sec144_smooth) *to terminate a tenancy for a fixed term shall be given at least 60 days before the expiration date specified in the tenancy agreement, to be effective on that expiration date.  2006, c. 17, s. 44 (4).*  The soonest termination date in this case would be August 27, 2017 and any notice earlier unless agreed to between the parties would not be in compliance with the [Act](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-2006-c-17/latest/so-2006-c-17.html).

I find that the Tenant failed to give proper notice in accordance with the [*Residential Tenancies Act, 2006*](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-2006-c-17/latest/so-2006-c-17.html) and therefore her 60 day notice to terminate was not sufficient.

&#x200B;

This case took place in 2017, and the laws haven't really changed since then. I dont know if the landlord and tenant board will make special exceptions this time due to the coronavirus extenuating circumstances. But I feel like anyone who signed a 3 year lease is out of luck."

The US empire is dying in real time, and by the time it finally occurs, however long that may be, the economic engine that is China will be well established as the world's new global superpower. and the fact that their human rights record is atrocious isn't going to make much of a difference.

To be fair, this isn't solely due to the coronavirus.

the US empire has been in gradual decline since GW Bush lied the nation into starting the Iraq invasion, ""justified"" by lies, propaganda and fabricated ""evidence"", and supported by the warmongering of the US corporate media. And within that war, he started his regime of deliberate torture, and fed that torture regime with his regime of international kidnapping (aka ""extraordinary rendition"") and his establishment of many ""black sites"" (i.e. illegal prisons established deliberately to feed the torture regime, to remain ""safe"" from any kind of oversight, and to ensure that those prisoners would never have access to any kind of legal system).

Obama stabilized that slide (briefly) with many speeches, but then built his own campaign of drone bombing civilians all over the world, convinced NATO to bomb Libya back to the stone age (and a decade later it is still a totally failed state), and pushed his regime change agenda in Syria with the recruitment and supply of a proxy army of outright terrorists.

and then Trump got into power, and since then he has lied constantly, he has insulted and abused the nations of the world and most of their leaders, he has instituted tariffs and sanctions on half of them for a variety of ""trumped up"" reasons, he has started a trade war with China that he has no idea how to resolve (or even know what ""winning"" might be, other than his fantasy of China surrendering completely and proclaiming Trump as their new King), he has burned down the decades of international support and alliances that has taken decades to build up, he has promoted lies and propaganda and waged war on any kind of free and open press, he used lies and propaganda to destroy a functioning agreement that kept Iran from nuclear weapons and then attacked any nation or corporation who attempted to help Iran to keep to its end of the agreement, he has set a policy of Making America ""Great"" which basically translates into making America isolated in a global community, and he has made a spectacle of his arrogance, ignorance, incompetence, ego and greed for all the world to see via his constant twittering.

the US is never going to be trusted again, and the alliances of trusted nations that Trump has destroyed are never going to come back. The electorate of bigots, racists, and isolationists that voted him into power are still strong in the US, and they are almost certain to elect another such moron and populist con-artist if given a chance, meaning that agreements with America are only as good as its current leadership. hence, not worth negotiating, and not trustworthy. Ever.

and then came the coronavirus, which Trump attempted to handle via his normal approach of lies, denial, gaslighting, incompetence, ignorance and propaganda. All of which have failed him, and all of which is ensuring a bodycount in the hundreds of thousands. Indeed, the only things currently saving the US from an even worse catastrophe is the competence of State Governors and leaders who refuse to listen to Trump's bullshit, and actually listen to facts, science and reality, none of which are even on Trump's radar.

So Trump's incompetence is merely the current step accelerating the decline and death of the US empire. By the time the US digs itself out of the looming depression which will drag it further down, there won't be an empire left at all, and all of those $trillions in national debt are going to make inflation skyrocket through the roof."

Respiratory specialist Mukherjee, 24, was back home after her trip to India, where she’d been carrying out charity work and was due to start back at Boston Pilgrim Hospital, Lincolnshire next week.
“I could not be prouder to be both Miss England and to serve something of great national pride like the NHS,” Bhasha tells the BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat.
She was in India as part of a humanitarian trip across Asia and was due to travel to countries including Pakistan.
After seeing the unfolding crisis in the UK, she wanted to “share the load”.
“I felt unfair getting dressed up in a place of safety while my colleagues were laying their lives on the frontline,” she said.
The NHS is adapting to rising coronavirus cases in the UK through staff redeployment and asking recently retired doctors and nurses to come back to work.
Currently, the beauty queen was sorting out the logistical issues of her return to work, including things like what shifts she would be be doing and where she would be living.
She’s currently self-isolating in her home city of Derby, which is around 80 miles from the hospital.
Mukherjee also knows the health risks of returning to the wards but is not worried about contracting the disease in the hospital.
“I could have caught it anytime or anywhere. I could have picked it up at any airport or while I was in India” she told the BBC.
“My main concern is the pressure our NHS is under.”
Bhasha was crowned Miss England in August 2019, shortly after gaining two medical degrees from the University of Nottingham.
She’d spent time training as a junior doctor on a respiratory ward, at the same time as modelling and taking part in pageants."

Intelligence agencies did not detect any alarm inside the Chinese government that analysts presumed would accompany the accidental leak of a deadly virus from a government laboratory. But Mr. Pottinger continued to believe the coronavirus problem was far worse than the Chinese were acknowledging. Inside the West Wing, the director of the Domestic Policy Council, Joe Grogan, also tried to sound alarms that the threat from China was growing.

>Mr. Pottinger, backed by Mr. O’Brien, became one of the driving forces of a campaign in the final weeks of January to convince Mr. Trump to impose limits on travel from China — the first substantive step taken to impede the spread of the virus and one that the president has repeatedly cited as evidence that he was on top of the problem.

>In addition to the opposition from the economic team, Mr. Pottinger and his allies among the China hawks had to overcome initial skepticism from the administration’s public health experts.

>Travel restrictions were usually counterproductive to managing biological outbreaks because they prevented doctors and other much-needed medical help from easily getting to the affected areas, the health officials said. And such bans often cause infected people to flee, spreading the disease further.

>But on the morning of Jan. 30, Mr. Azar got a call from Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield and others saying they had changed their minds. The World Health Organization had declared a global public health emergency and American officials had discovered the first confirmed case of person-to-person transmission inside the United States.

>The economic team, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, continued to argue that there were big risks in taking a provocative step toward China and moving to curb global travel. After a debate, Mr. Trump came down on the side of the hawks and the public health team. The limits on travel from China were publicly announced on Jan. 31.

>Still, Mr. Trump and other senior officials were wary of further upsetting Beijing. Besides the concerns about the impact on the trade deal, they knew that an escalating confrontation was risky because the United States relies heavily on China for pharmaceuticals and the kinds of protective equipment most needed to combat the coronavirus.

>But the hawks kept pushing in February to take a critical stance toward China amid the growing crisis. Mr. Pottinger and others — including aides to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — pressed for government statements to use the term “Wuhan Virus.”

>Mr. Pompeo tried to hammer the anti-China message at every turn, eventually even urging leaders of the Group of 7 industrialized countries to use “Wuhan virus” in a joint statement.

>Others, including aides to Mr. Pence, resisted taking a hard public line, believing that angering Beijing might lead the Chinese government to withhold medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and any scientific research that might ultimately lead to a vaccine.

>Mr. Trump took a conciliatory approach through the middle of March, praising the job Mr. Xi was doing.

>That changed abruptly, when aides informed Mr. Trump that a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman had publicly spun a new conspiracy about the origins of Covid-19: that it was brought to China by U.S. Army personnel who visited the country last October.

>Mr. Trump was furious, and he took to his favorite platform to broadcast a new message. On March 16, he wrote on Twitter that “the United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus.”

>Mr. Trump’s decision to escalate the war of words undercut any remaining possibility of broad cooperation between the governments to address a global threat. It remains to be seen whether that mutual suspicion will spill over into efforts to develop treatments or vaccines, both areas where the two nations are now competing.

>One immediate result was a free-for-all across the United States, with state and local governments and hospitals bidding on the open market for scarce but essential Chinese-made products. When the state of Massachusetts managed to procure 1.2 million masks, it fell to the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert K. Kraft, a Trump ally, to cut through extensive red tape on both sides of the Pacific to send his own plane to pick them up.

>The Consequences of Chaos

>The chaotic culture of the Trump White House contributed to the crisis. A lack of planning and a failure to execute, combined with the president’s focus on the news cycle and his preference for following his gut rather than the data cost time, and perhaps lives.

>Inside the West Wing, Mr. Navarro, Mr. Trump’s trade adviser, was widely seen as quick-tempered, self-important and prone to butting in. He is among the most outspoken of China hawks and in late January was clashing with the administration’s health experts over limiting travel from China.

>So it elicited eye rolls when, after initially being prevented from joining the coronavirus task force, he circulated a memo on Jan. 29 urging Mr. Trump to impose the travel limits, arguing that failing to confront the outbreak aggressively could be catastrophic, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses.

>The uninvited message could not have conflicted more with the president’s approach at the time of playing down the severity of the threat. And when aides raised it with Mr. Trump, he responded that he was unhappy that Mr. Navarro had put his warning in writing.

>From the time the virus was first identified as a concern, the administration’s response was plagued by the rivalries and factionalism that routinely swirl around Mr. Trump and, along with the president’s impulsiveness, undercut decision making and policy development.

>Faced with the relentless march of a deadly pathogen, the disagreements and a lack of long-term planning had significant consequences. They slowed the president’s response and resulted in problems with execution and planning, including delays in seeking money from Capitol Hill and a failure to begin broad surveillance testing.

>The efforts to shape Mr. Trump’s view of the virus began early in January, when his focus was elsewhere: the fallout from his decision to kill Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s security mastermind; his push for an initial trade deal with China; and his Senate impeachment trial, which was about to begin.

>Even after Mr. Azar first briefed him about the potential seriousness of the virus during a phone call on Jan. 18 while the president was at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump projected confidence that it would be a passing problem.

>“We have it totally under control,” he told an interviewer a few days later while attending the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. “It’s going to be just fine.”

>Back in Washington, voices outside of the White House peppered Mr. Trump with competing assessments about what he should do and how quickly he should act.

>The efforts to sort out policy behind closed doors were contentious and sometimes only loosely organized.

>That was the case when the National Security Council convened a meeting on short notice on the afternoon of Jan. 27. The Situation Room was standing room only, packed with top White House advisers, low-level staffers, Mr. Trump’s social media guru, and several cabinet secretaries. There was no checklist about the preparations for a possible pandemic, which would require intensive testing, rapid acquisition of protective gear, and perhaps serious limitations on Americans’ movements.

>Instead, after a 20-minute description by Mr. Azar of his department’s capabilities, the meeting was jolted when Stephen E. Biegun, the newly installed deputy secretary of state, announced plans to issue a “level four” travel warning, strongly discouraging Americans from traveling to China. The room erupted into bickering.

>A few days later, on the evening of Jan. 30, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff at the time, and Mr. Azar called Air Force One as the president was making the final decision to go ahead with the restrictions on China travel. Mr. Azar was blunt, warning that the virus could develop into a pandemic and arguing that China should be criticized for failing to be transparent.

>Mr. Trump rejected the idea of criticizing China, saying the country had enough to deal with. And if the president’s decision on the travel restrictions suggested that he fully grasped the seriousness of the situation, his response to Mr. Azar indicated otherwise.

>Stop panicking, Mr. Trump told him.

>That sentiment was present throughout February, as the president’s top aides reached for a consistent message but took few concrete steps to prepare for the possibility of a major public health crisis.

>During a briefing on Capitol Hill on Feb. 5, senators urged administration officials to take the threat more seriously. Several asked if the administration needed additional money to help local and state health departments prepare.

>Derek Kan, a senior official from the Office of Management and Budget, replied that the administration had all the money it needed, at least at that point, to stop the virus, two senators who attended the briefing said."

No, *you* hear mostly this.  Nothing of this ""secret"" information you think you're revealing is even remotely new to me, and I'm pretty far from a news junkie.  Get your head out of FoxNews and YouTube.  Most coronavirus coverage at the NYT is free, avail yourself of it.  Many of the worlds great newspapers are offering free coverage.  

Geez, do you even know that the Swedish plan is pretty much identical to the original UK plan?  In other words, the UK has done *exactly* the evaluation you're pretending nobody has done, and have altered their course in reaction.  And in the US, there's 50 different models out there and lots of debate over which is better.

Go read a real news source. Stop watching Hannity.

Look, I've asked you multiple times what we think we might be doing wrong, and you still have zero substance to your posts.  You're just complaining that nobody is as smart as you, that leaders don't have any of the insights you brilliantly have, that doctors don't understand how predictive models work, and yet with all your stunning insight you still don't have any actual argument to make.  I give up.  If you think there's no debate, then start one."

These systems are politically managed. Nothing as important as healthcare should be a political tool, because you will never be in a situation to always elect perfect angels with perfect knowledge about the needs and desires of everyone in society.

Free markets excel at this.(and before people start whinging about the US healthcare system, it is *not* free market either).

South Korea has a universal healthcare system, yet 94% of hospitals are private, 70% of the population choose private insurance and care is fee for service. While people blame underfunding in UK, national insurance is 12% of your income, compared to less than half that in South Korea. SK also have more than 5x the number of ICU capacity than the OECD average and 10x of many universal care systems in Europe. This put the country in an exceptional position to deal with the new coronavirus.

So, a smaller, more market oriented, less politically driven system, even with a universal care option, is outperforming the behemoth that is NHS."

It's called [reassortment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reassortment).

Coronavirus on the other hand has only one ""mini-chromosome"", so changes in it's DNA result from random mutations (mostly). The natural rate of such random mutation is known, and allows one to guess how long ago two similar bits of DNA were previously identical. 

This is called a [molecular clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock), and is also affected by how long a generation is for that particular organism (which is only a day or so for cornavirus).  A ~4% difference in coronavirus geneme thus corresponds to a time period of decades since the two were identical.

Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is most definitely **not** the result of a transmission from the bat viruses identified to human last year."

Flying internationally or even across the U.S. still seems kinda dicey, but fortunately a lot of wrestlers for WWE and AEW live close enough to drive.

&#x200B;

I wish all the shows would remain taped, just because it's easier to keep all the personnel at a distance from each other. Kind of annoying that AEW has had a few issues like the Inner Circle all in the ring crowded or that one moment (I forget which Dynamite) where some of the heels in the crowd joined in on beating down someone in the match. And that Gronk spot at WM was unnecessary, like I get they wanted to have him win the 24/7 Championship, but yeah. Also, I'm super paranoid about coronavirus in general, so that kind of stuff makes me anxious, even with the precautions."

Mike Trout is your new god, unless he was already that to you before you became an Angels fan, in which case that's good. 

The Mike Trout/Shohei Ohtani bromance is the best in all of baseball. 

The Angels actually started life as the Los Angeles Angels, based on a team of the same name that played in the PCL. They played their inaugural year in Wrigley Field (yes, that Wrigley, but not that Wrigley Field) and four years at Chavez Ravine (Dodger Stadium but named that for their home games) before moving into The Big A.

The LA Times likes to dunk on the Angels because they're shitbirds and their team still hasn't won a stupid piece of metal this millennium, so we like to hate on them. Also they were like the last major news publication to allow for free coronavirus news articles for non- subscribers and are still shitbirds about making clear how to access those articles for free, so fuck them."

Title: **Got screwed by pit garage owner need some help**

Original Post: 

> I do racing in Motorsport and the guy that runs the garage where I store my kart is being a dick. He services my kart and stores it. One day I come to the track , do a couple laps and my engine blows up because apparently it was 27 hours overdue for a service. And nobody bothered to tell me. This isn’t the problem though. I got lucky as the coronavirus outbreak started around the same time so the track closed so I wasn’t missing out. This means that I can’t use his services even though I paid him for a whole year. I asked him if he could comp the month that the garage has been closed but he refuses and says that the terms and conditions say that I’m only entitled practice whenever the track is available and that this isn’t a valid reason for me to ask for compensation. Do I have a case or not?

Recently CNN’s Dr. Gupta highlighted one of these tragic cases in a fear-mongering piece called “The mystery of why the coronavirus kills some young people.” The article features lots of speculation about “an unusual pattern that seems to be emerging” without including any actual data on death rates compared to other age groups. He claims that “as we start to look deeper and hear more stories, it is becoming apparent there are many people” like the patient he describes.

Since it’s impossible to assign a numerical value to Dr. Gupta’s “many people,” I decided to take a look at some of the data for myself and the figure below highlights what I found. Young and healthy people only account for between 0.42 and 1.03% (0.48% estimated actual) of all the deaths we’ve seen so far in NYC. This means that if 100,000 people die of the virus we would expect that only 420 to 1,030 of them would be age 18-44 with no underlying conditions. So ultimately there’s no mystery here. We’re dealing with a highly contagious virus and a median nationwide age of 38.2. We should expect that young, healthy people will die unexpectedly but it should be relatively rare."

It doesn't matter how good hospitals are if you don't have access to them.  And even if you do, you're paying *vastly* more money for them.  Besides, your link say nothing about the *average* of hospitals, just where the world's top raning ones are.  So if you've got absoutely fucktons of money, the sure, the US has got to hospitals for you.  For everyone else, it's 'fuck off and die, peasant'.

As for coronavirus deaths, I wouldn't be making too many big claims until the pandemic has passed.  European countries had outbreaks well in advance of the US, so they didn't have the luxury of being warned.  And currently, the US rate of increase in deaths is outpacing European countries."

Meanwhile, state-owned SBI, which has the highest number of PMJDY accounts, asked the beneficiaries not to believe in rumours that the money will be taken away by the government if not withdrawn amid large numbers of people flocking banks.
As a result of this, there are rush at bank branches leading to violation of social distancing guidelines to check the spread of coronavirus.
The Department of Financial Services (DFS) in a tweet said the government has deposited Rs 500 in the PMJDY accounts held by women for April and beneficiaries could withdraw it ""any time"".
""This amount (Rs 500) has reached your bank account and you can withdraw it any time,"" it said, and added Rs 500 will also be deposited during May as well in June.
The DFS, in the finance ministry, also asked the beneficiaries not to believe in rumours and withdraw the amount from ATM, customer service point or banks as per their convenience.
Of the total 38.08 crore accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), as many as 20.60 crore were held by women. As on April 1, the deposits in the PMJDY accounts stood at over Rs 1.19 lakh crore.
State Bank of India (SBI) further said, ""We would like to assure our customers that the funds in your account will not be blocked or returned to the government.""
The country's largest lender also asked the PMJDY account holders to withdraw money at their convenience anytime.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced this as part of the Rs 1.70-lakh crore relief package announced last month.
The minister had said as many as 20.5 crore women Jan Dhan account holders will get Rs 500 per month for next three months to run their households, a move aimed at mitigating the hardships caused by the lockdown."

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well"

It published an article stating that most of the cases in NYC came from Europe. [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html)

The genetics is what allows for the tracing. In other words, most cases were imported from Europe, not China. 

Why would Mr Trump be so pissed about it? well, when he decided to close the US to China, that was not enough. Many reports at the time pointed to slow incubation and fast spread in Europe. 

Someone should send mr Trump a link to nextstrain and then slowly slowly explain to him what it all means."

NYC is going through their peak now, according to what I can see. I was wrong about mid May, but there are several Midwest and Western states that won't hit their peak until very late April, early May. [NPR article I found](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/07/825479416/new-yorks-coronavirus-deaths-may-level-off-soon-when-might-your-state-s-peak?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_medium=social&fbclid=IwAR0FxBFaOBUOi2314YWskRTuwXLbJg4VMkPM19RKH3Tvpxp6OirigBVgJR8)

Here's the thing that gets me. These are just projections, based on people actually social distancing and continuing to being vigilant **until the end of May.** I'm already hearing people say they might as well stop quarantine now since ""it'll be over in 2 weeks anyway.""

Just because the data looks like good right now, that doesn't mean we stop doing the thing that's saving us from a healthcare collapse. Let's be honest and say that's what this quarantine is about, it's not about ""saving lives."" People will die either way, from the virus or unemployment. The issue is that if our healthcare system buckles under the pressure of this virus, we would see exponentially more deaths. That's the outcome we're trying to avoid. (I guess it is about saving lives, but not in the way most people are talking about: virus vs poverty.)

I'm afraid diminishingly the severity of this could lead to that even worse outcome."

It has a high mortality rate and kills quickly meaning it’s much harder to spread than something like COVID 19 which has a much lower mortality rate and a long incubation period. 

Essentially Ebola gets noticed and isolated quickly while Coronavirus is much harder to detect. They’re both very different viruses, comparing Trumps response to Obama’s dosent really make sense.

Coronavirus spreads incredibly quickly, the benefit of hindsight would have been great for President Trump and other world leaders but once it starts spreading they’re isn’t much they can do, it’s pointless blaming him for something out of his control."

The government is considering the request made by the Chief Ministers during the Video Conference chaired by Mr Modi. Mr Modi said that it is very important to concentrate on the safety of the people. 
He added that he motto of the government earlier was ‘jaan hai to jahaan hai’ but now is ‘jaan bhi jahaan bhi’, highlighting the importance of people's lives. He said, our fight against Coronavirus will be strengthened as long as every citizen of the country keeps fulfilling responsibilities and follows the instructions of the government and administration. 
PM Modi said, while talking about the lockdown, he had emphasized that to save the life of every citizen, lockdown and adherence to Social Distancing is very important. Most of the people understood this and fulfilled their responsibilities by confining themselves to their homes. He said, we all had followed this mantra and made efforts to save the lives of other countrymen.
 
 
Prime Minister observed that the combined efforts of the Centre and the States has definitely helped reduce the impact of COVID-19 but since the situation is rapidly evolving, constant vigilance is paramount. He emphasized the criticality of coming 3 to 4 weeks for determining the impact of the steps taken till now to contain the virus, adding that teamwork is the key to facing the challenge. 
Mr Modi categorically assured that India has adequate supplies of essential medicines and said that measures are being taken to ensure availability of protective gear and critical equipment for all front-line workers. He also gave a stern message against black marketing and hoarding. 
Condemning and expressing distress at the instances of attacks on the doctors and medical staff, and at incidents of misbehavior with students from North-East and Kashmir, Prime Minister underlined that such cases need to be dealt with firmly. He also spoke about the need to curb Lockdown violations and ensure that social distancing is followed.
 
Talking about the Exit Plan from lockdown, Prime Minister said that there seems to be a consensus amongst the states on extension of lockdown by another two weeks. He underlined that the motto of the government earlier was ‘jaan hai to jahaan hai’ but now is ‘jaan bhi jahaan bhi’. Prime Minister talked about strengthening healthcare infrastructure and reaching out to patients through tele-medicine. 
He also suggested that direct marketing for farm produce can be incentivised to prevent crowding in mandis, for which model APMC laws should be reformed swiftly. He said, such steps will help farmers sell products at their doorstep.
The Prime Minister also spoke about popularizing the Aarogya Setu app to ensure downloads in greater numbers. He referred to how South Korea and Singapore got success in contact tracing.
He said, based on those experiences, India has made its own effort through the app which will be an essential tool in India’s fight against the pandemic, he said. He also referred to the possibility of the app being an e-pass which could subsequently facilitate travel from one place to another.
 
Talking about the economic challenges, Prime Minister said that the crisis is an opportunity to become self-reliant and turn the nation into an economic powerhouse.
 
The Chief Ministers provided feedback about the COVID-19 positive cases in their respective states, steps taken by then to maintain social distancing, ramp up healthcare infrastructure, mitigate difficulties of migrants and maintain supply of essentials. "

According to the guidelines, a person who has travel history, contact history or confirmed case of novel coronavirus, has to be excluded from blood donation.
Social distancing measures should be followed in the blood donation site.
They also said that if a donor reports back to the blood centre or camp organiser within 14 days of donating the blood, experiencing illness suspected to be Covid-19 or is confirmed positive case of coronavirus or his close contact being confirmed with the infection post donation, he must be referred appropriately for further management by the Blood Centre Medical Officer.
The blood or blood components collected from such individuals should be discarded.
Haemovigilance should continue to capture and analyse any adverse events which are associated with blood and blood component transfusion including post donation and post transfusion infections should be reported to Haemovigilance Programme of India (HvPI) of National Institute of Biologicals (NIB) with copies to representative State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) and State Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and properly investigated.
National Blood Transfusion Council of India Director, Dr Shobini Rajan directed all states AIDS control societies and state blood transfusion councils to adapt the guidance.
""Requests have been received from several stakeholders engaged with managing blood centres and blood transfusion services regarding concerns with maintaining safety and adequacy of blood during this period of restricted gathering and social distancing,"" she said.
Rajan also said that blood centres world over are dependent on voluntary blood donation from healthy individuals to meet their blood supply. Since the demand for blood and blood components continues, especially for those patients depending on blood transfusions as a life saving measure like thalassemics, accident victims, pregnant women and critically sick patients, it is essential that the supply of safe blood continue to be maintained at licensed blood centres in the country."

According to the guidelines, a person who has travel history, contact history or confirmed case of novel coronavirus, has to be excluded from blood donation.
Social distancing measures should be followed in the blood donation site.
They also said that if a donor reports back to the blood centre or camp organiser within 14 days of donating the blood, experiencing illness suspected to be Covid-19 or is confirmed positive case of coronavirus or his close contact being confirmed with the infection post donation, he must be referred appropriately for further management by the Blood Centre Medical Officer.
The blood or blood components collected from such individuals should be discarded.
Haemovigilance should continue to capture and analyse any adverse events which are associated with blood and blood component transfusion including post donation and post transfusion infections should be reported to Haemovigilance Programme of India (HvPI) of National Institute of Biologicals (NIB) with copies to representative State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) and State Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and properly investigated.
National Blood Transfusion Council of India Director, Dr Shobini Rajan directed all states AIDS control societies and state blood transfusion councils to adapt the guidance.
""Requests have been received from several stakeholders engaged with managing blood centres and blood transfusion services regarding concerns with maintaining safety and adequacy of blood during this period of restricted gathering and social distancing,"" she said.
Rajan also said that blood centres world over are dependent on voluntary blood donation from healthy individuals to meet their blood supply. Since the demand for blood and blood components continues, especially for those patients depending on blood transfusions as a life saving measure like thalassemics, accident victims, pregnant women and critically sick patients, it is essential that the supply of safe blood continue to be maintained at licensed blood centres in the country."

Yes, I insinuated that it could be, I don't discount anything. And I did no such thing as ""disappear down a rabbit hole"". 

Bill Gates has taken the world stage for his billions in funding he's poured into vaccine research (and more specifically now COVID-19), is an open proponent of world depopulation, and funds the [ID2020](https://id2020.org/) project with the Rockefeller Foundation to create a digital ID and cryptocurrency wallet for all humans. He funded [Event 201](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/resources) simulation back in October that was a simulation of a global pandemic of coronavirus, and also funds [this research](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/spiky-patch-could-invisibly-record-vaccination-history-under-skin-180973809/) into NIR QD biomarkers for digital tracking of vaccinated people. This is all during which time he says in a reddit AMA that we will all have ""digital certificates"" of vaccination.

He's already been testing the ID2020 program on [refugees at Mae La, Thailand](https://www.newsweek.com/2019/03/08/can-blockchain-finally-give-us-digital-privacy-we-deserve-1340689.html). It uses the same blockchain data management system (based on MIT's OPAL model) that I spoke of before.

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

It's at 10 percent in Italy, 5.4 in Wuhan. Back then, these epicenters would have formed much easier, and moreover the hospitals would not be close to comparable in terms of capacity and technical solutions like respirators. The population would not have been very old, but due to the war, still rather prone to sickness I guess. Also, lots of smoking. And the gas... Omg the gas. Must've been loads of soldiers with respiratory problems. 

Less diabetes and obesity, though. 

The Spanish flu was widely underreported. Many people did not even know it happened. Fact of the matter is, governments were busy playing war. Now they are busy making money, but I guess that's more of a concerted effort, so better to fight global pandemics. 

As others pointed out, medicine didn't even know about the difference between bacteria and viruses.

On the plus side, it might have prevented ww2 due to a lack of soldiers!"

If I could quit my job and get unemployment under the cause “I don’t feel entirely comfortable taking the risk of contaminating and killing my parents with coronavirus”. Then we wouldn’t be having this conversation, people can’t do that

Millions of people are risking their lives and their families because they have no fucking choice, and people don’t think they deserve compensation for that?

Yes, that is a desire of mine, but it ISN'T the ONLY reason! My biggest fear is the long term financial effects of a drastically extended shutdown will be worse than the actual life-taking virus itself. We really cannot have 100% containment of the coronavirus (whether we find a vaccine or not), but the US does still have the control to prevent the depressing  economic downfall we could be faced with if we do not take different measures by not keeping all the non-essential businesses, (or ones that are currently shutdown), under the order to remain closed indefinitely. I just don't see the greater good in this if whether we extend shutdown or not, the virus will still be infectious amongst us and will be killing people who are high risk. Yes of course the number of cases and deaths will be less if we keep all closures and social distancing, but we should think about the increasing number of people who will end up homeless, starving, committing crimes, etc, due to excessive shutdown. 

We should be slowly opening up our small businesses and non-Essential establishments with obvious regulations and restrictions enforced in order to try to prevent a huge jump in virus cases while still being able to evacuate our homes. It should be highly recommended that ones who are at risk like the elderly or people with pre-existing conditions for them to stay home as often as possible and to work from home if they can. 

We won't know a date or a time as to when the number of people who have this virus will significantly decrease enough for life to be considered ""fully normal"" again. I just think we should be as concerned with the financial crisis the US will suffer from as we are for the crisis of people testing positive from COVID. 

My thoughts and prayers go to everyone who has been greatly affected by this pandemic on every aspect."

 Os países da região apresentam sérias limitações, mas a experiência no [combate a epidemias](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/compare-a-covid-19-com-outras-epidemias-que-assolaram-a-humanidade.shtml) não pode ser menosprezada. [Serra Leoa, Nigéria e nações da África Central enfrentaram o ebola](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/patriciacamposmello/2019/09/mundo-esta-despreparado-para-a-proxima-epidemia-global.shtml). As da África Austral formaram gerações de especialistas em Aids.

 No início do mês, porém, cientistas franceses desencadearam uma polêmica [ao declararem que eventuais vacinas contra a Covid-19 deveriam ser testadas primeiro na África](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/04/africa-nao-sera-campo-de-testes-para-vacina-contra-coronavirus-diz-diretor-da-oms.shtml), “um pouco como foi feito para certos estudos sobre Aids ou com prostitutas”.

 O ex-jogador de futebol Didier Drogba, por anos astro do Chelsea, respondeu nas redes sociais que os africanos não são ratos de laboratório.

 A África obviamente também sofre com a pandemia, mas os efeitos do vírus não atingem a região de maneira uniforme. Cada país tem sua história, e os contrastes podem ser ainda maiores do que em outros continentes ou lugares de proporções continentais.

  Três nações que dominam o imaginário brasileiro sobre a África —Angola, África do Sul e Moçambique— passam por experiências distintas.

 Angola estava desde o começo como um dos países mais expostos ao vírus devido ao alto risco de importação de casos oriundos da China. Dos mais de 1 milhão de chineses que residem na África, 250 mil se estabeleceram no país.

 A ameaça se tornou ainda maior quando a pandemia atingiu a Europa e particularmente Portugal. A conexão Luanda-Lisboa é a principal porta de Angola para o mundo.

 Um decreto impôs confinamento rígido ao país, limitando consideravelmente deslocamentos, reuniões e atividades públicas, mas, na prática, o governo quer sobretudo isolar Luanda, a cidade que mais cresce na África.

 Nos seus infinitos musseques, como são conhecidas as regiões urbanas mais carentes, havia o risco de a transmissão comunitária se propagar de forma descontrolada.

 Na ausência de um sistema de saúde organizado, o governo do MPLA (Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola), no poder desde a independência, recorreu ao Exército, um dos mais equipados da região, e ao serviço de inteligência, formado pelo paranoico regime da Alemanha Oriental nos anos 1980.

 O resultado é uma quarentena agressiva, com relatos em redes sociais e na mídia portuguesa de episódios de violência cometidos por forças de segurança.

 Ninguém sabe se essa solução policialesca vai vingar. Mas os angolanos já reconhecem o cheiro dos anos da guerra e da violência política.

 Por fim, na última segunda (6), relatório da União Africana projetou que cerca de 20 milhões de empregos, tanto formais quanto informais, estão ameaçados no continente caso a crise se estenda.

 Segundo o estudo, países que dependem de petróleo, como Angola, devem ser mais duramente atingidos.

 Também no sul da África, Moçambique já tinha problemas de sobra quando o coronavírus começou a dar as caras. Uma insurgência com ramificações islamitas ganha terreno no norte do país. Outro movimento paramilitar, liderado por dissidentes da Renamo (Resistência Nacional Moçambicana), a histórica formação de oposição, atrasa a resolução do conflito armado.

 Escândalos internacionais de corrupção e desastres ambientais —dois ciclones arrasaram o país em 2019— deixaram a população sem dinheiro, comida e trabalho.

 Enquanto isso, os governantes da Frelimo (Frente de Libertação de Moçambique) se agarram ao sonho dos recursos naturais: nos últimos anos, multinacionais anunciaram investimentos colossais no setor do gás natural.

 A percepção de que o Estado não dispunha de meios para lidar com a crise deixou o presidente Filipe Nyusi em negação. Ele passou as primeiras semanas tentando minimizar os casos de transmissão comunitária.

 A ideia de fechar fronteiras era descartada por representar um suicídio político: a troca comercial com a África do Sul é o balão de oxigênio do país.

 Tudo mudou no final de março, quando o país vizinho declarou guerra ao coronavírus.

 Pragmático, o presidente sul-africano, Cyril Ramaphosa, não quer acabar como seus predecessores, Jacob Zuma e Thabo Mbeki, lembrados por terem minimizado a Aids.

 O governo atual declarou quarentena total antes mesmo do registro da primeira morte no país, impôs medidas drásticas e lançou iniciativas como minivans equipadas com laboratório para testes rápidos.

 Além de ter estendido na quinta-feira (9) o lockdown no país por mais duas semanas, Ramaphosa também disponibilizou um fundo de US$ 2,2 bilhões (R$ 11,24 bilhões) para ajudar pessoas incapazes de trabalhar e, assim, tentar evitar a perda de empregos.

 A reação rápida fez da África do Sul um modelo para o sul global, ainda que as denúncias de que tem sido usada violência policial para garantir o cumprimento das restrições também sejam comuns no país.

 Outro motivo para a resposta contundente deve-se aos números, uma vez que a África do Sul lidera o ranking de casos de Covid-19 confirmados no continente (2.003 até a tarde deste sábado, 11). A expectativa é que as cifras subam quando o país passar a fazer testes em massa.

 Se as ações para conter a proliferação do vírus animam os sul-africanos, elas são uma tragédia para os vizinhos moçambicanos.

 Uma vez decretado o fechamento das fronteiras, milhares de migrantes, muitos dos quais possivelmente infectados, regressaram e se espalharam pelo país, inclusive nas regiões mais abandonadas do norte, onde a elite da capital, Maputo, não apita quase nada.

 Casos começaram a pipocar por todo lado, inclusive em Cabo Delgado. O sonho do gás natural está virando rapidamente um pesadelo.

 A empresa francesa Total anunciou que havia casos confirmados de coronavírus em seu quadro de funcionários, e a americana Exxon postergou a decisão final de investir em Moçambique, agora sob estado de emergência.

 A história da pandemia nesses diferentes países ainda está por ser contada, mas a de Moçambique, por uma série de de circunstâncias, já é possível especular: será calamitosa.

Apparently the number of people classified as ""dead in their own homes"" (people that did not go to the hospital or get tested for Coronavirus) is 8 times higher than last year in the same time-span.

In addition, there has been a substantial increase in deaths due to ""respiratory issues"" ""pneumonia"" etc. 

Due testing shortages, a lot of people are dying but are nor marked down as Coronavirus deaths, because you can't speculate that somebody dies from Coronavirus without testing for it.

But there has been a substantial increase in people classified as ""died in their own home"" And a substantial increase in people that have died due to ""respiratory failure and pneumonia"" I suspect the death rate is much higher than reported."

The government is considering the request made by the Chief Ministers during the Video Conference chaired by Mr Modi. Mr Modi said that it is very important to concentrate on the safety of the people. 
He added that he motto of the government earlier was ‘jaan hai to jahaan hai’ but now is ‘jaan bhi jahaan bhi’, highlighting the importance of people's lives. He said, our fight against Coronavirus will be strengthened as long as every citizen of the country keeps fulfilling responsibilities and follows the instructions of the government and administration. 
PM Modi said, while talking about the lockdown, he had emphasized that to save the life of every citizen, lockdown and adherence to Social Distancing is very important. Most of the people understood this and fulfilled their responsibilities by confining themselves to their homes. He said, we all had followed this mantra and made efforts to save the lives of other countrymen.
 
 
Prime Minister observed that the combined efforts of the Centre and the States has definitely helped reduce the impact of COVID-19 but since the situation is rapidly evolving, constant vigilance is paramount. He emphasized the criticality of coming 3 to 4 weeks for determining the impact of the steps taken till now to contain the virus, adding that teamwork is the key to facing the challenge. 
Mr Modi categorically assured that India has adequate supplies of essential medicines and said that measures are being taken to ensure availability of protective gear and critical equipment for all front-line workers. He also gave a stern message against black marketing and hoarding. 
Condemning and expressing distress at the instances of attacks on the doctors and medical staff, and at incidents of misbehavior with students from North-East and Kashmir, Prime Minister underlined that such cases need to be dealt with firmly. He also spoke about the need to curb Lockdown violations and ensure that social distancing is followed.
 
Talking about the Exit Plan from lockdown, Prime Minister said that there seems to be a consensus amongst the states on extension of lockdown by another two weeks. He underlined that the motto of the government earlier was ‘jaan hai to jahaan hai’ but now is ‘jaan bhi jahaan bhi’. Prime Minister talked about strengthening healthcare infrastructure and reaching out to patients through tele-medicine. 
He also suggested that direct marketing for farm produce can be incentivised to prevent crowding in mandis, for which model APMC laws should be reformed swiftly. He said, such steps will help farmers sell products at their doorstep.
The Prime Minister also spoke about popularizing the Aarogya Setu app to ensure downloads in greater numbers. He referred to how South Korea and Singapore got success in contact tracing.
He said, based on those experiences, India has made its own effort through the app which will be an essential tool in India’s fight against the pandemic, he said. He also referred to the possibility of the app being an e-pass which could subsequently facilitate travel from one place to another.
 
Talking about the economic challenges, Prime Minister said that the crisis is an opportunity to become self-reliant and turn the nation into an economic powerhouse.
 
The Chief Ministers provided feedback about the COVID-19 positive cases in their respective states, steps taken by then to maintain social distancing, ramp up healthcare infrastructure, mitigate difficulties of migrants and maintain supply of essentials. "

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

Posting back the very same link to me I already posted to you, is a very weird way to make a point.

You claim [they said](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fyg3oh/coronavirus_us_officials_knew_of_wuhan_health/fn4c27q/):

> Can you tell me how **the WHO could say there’s no evidence** of human to human transmission

When what they actually said [was](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152):

> **Preliminary investigations** conducted by the Chinese authorities have found **no clear evidence** of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China

Because that's how actual science often works: With quite a bit of uncertainty, yet you make out of ""no **clear** evidence"", which implies there is evidence, a ""no evidence"", like words don't even have meaning and you can just ignore those ones that don't fir your **lies**.

> They tweeted this while Chinese doctors were getting sick.

They didn't just tweet, they released a whole report, but much more convenient to focus on that one Tweet supposedly claiming things it never claimed.

> https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-wuhan-doctor-ai-fen-speaks-out-against-authorities

That's from one month ago, the WHO Tweet is from January 14 and was citing the only **preliminary** investigation that existed at that time, it's not the WHO's fault that happened to be from China, that's due to the fact that China was the first country affected.

Would you rather the WHO wouldn't have cited anything at all, so you would now be here accusing the WHO of ""covering up for China"" for **not** sharing the results of that very first official investigation?

> I don’t know if you are a Chinese hack

Says the guy who keeps on blatantly lying like it's just breathing air. Again: ""no clear evidence"" does **not** mean ""no evidence"", just like January and March are completely different months. But don't let that stop you from accusing others of being paid shills while taking such massive liberties with what actually happened.

> it’s clear and obvious China lied and suppressed information

Yes, just as clearly as the WHO said that there's ""no evidence"" for human-to-human transmission, like none at all, that's what they said, right?

> Anybody paying attention knew there was human-to-human transmission.

Leave it to the guy who can't even read a short Tweet or a calendar properly, to be now a complete expert on how medical science goes about classifying symptoms and transmission routes.

Which apparently happens based on hearsay and ""paying attention"", that's why science never gets it wrong, it's infallible, just like God or Trump, right?"

Even more depressing is seeing how flippantly Trump is treating the situation, and is making no concessions for people who can't afford healthcare.

I live in Ireland, where there's a two-tier public and private healthcare system. If you earn below a certain amount then healthcare is free, if you're above the threshold they you have to get insurance/pay for treatment. In the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, the government has taken over the private hospitals and made them public, has suspended the private healthcare system and amalgamated it into one system. They made if clear that regardless of income, anyone who thinks they're ill with the virus will not have to pay for testing or treatment, so that way they can get a fuller picture of how it's spreading. 

It's unreal that in the US this won't be done, which means the figures are likely much, much higher than reported."

• ⁠Trump should have acted swiftly to combat the coronavirus when he had the time and chance to months ago

Why waste taxpayer money fighting a hoax virus that is just the flu? It could hurt the markets.

• He should stop spreading either unproven or misinformed facts about how to cure covid-19 / it's current progress

He is the president so he has the bestfacts and is trying his best to get it past Deep State agents like  Fauci and the lamestream mainstream media who are trying to hype up this fake news virus. 

• ⁠He should encourage release greater stimulus towards working members of society, not large corporations that have overextended themselves

Individuals don't make society run, corporations and mass employers do. They deserve the bulk of the relief because they employ the majority of the people. If you're too poor to afford a 3-6 month emergency, that's your fault. Giving money to individuals is socialism.

• ⁠He should stop using Twitter as a means of official communication


He only uses Twitter because the lamestream mainstream fake news deep state Democrat loving Constitution hating media will refuse to let him speak unfiltered directly to the American people.

• ⁠He should maintain the USPS's funding 

Government ran entities are bad by default. We have FedEx and UPS. The free market will provide.

• ⁠He should not separate families at the border 

If they don't like it, they can go back. 

• ⁠He should cooperate with Congressional subpoena 

Why should he be at the mercy of Deep State Pelosi? Impeachment is a witch hunt!


• ⁠He should not engage in uneconomical trade wars 

We need trade wars to bring back manufacturing and manual labor jobs back to America! I am sick and tired of the Chinese and Mexicans taking our jobs!

• ⁠He should not try to maintain coal as a dominant power source

We have tons of people with families who make their money off coal! Global warming is a liberal deep state hoax created by communist professors at liberal universities!

• ⁠He should not disrespect war veterans 

Trump has never disrespected a war veteran that wasn't asking for it. 
• ⁠He should not pardon convicted war criminals

Gallagher did nothing wrong. He killed terrorists! Islam is a shithole religion for shithole people.

 • ⁠He should not retaliate against military officers taking action to maintain the health of their subordinates

As commander-in-chief, all people in the military swear an oath of loyalty to the president. The Captain was a disrespectful snot nosed moron who tried to hurt Trump by making up some fake story about the hoax Chinese virus!

• ⁠He should not mock the disabled 

He has never mocked a disabled person. It was a joke.

• ⁠He should involve his administration in more renewable energy investment

Why? Coal and oil will last forever. As stated earlier, global warming and climate change are fake news hoaxes. 

• ⁠He should not fraternize with dictators 

He is keeping America safe!
• ⁠He should not lie as frequently as he does

He doesn't tell lies. Trump tells jokes and uncomfortable truths and the fake news media makes up the lies!

 • ⁠He should not ban immigration from countries on religious basis

Muslims did 9/11. Allowing them in here is asking for another one.

• ⁠He should consider his appointees more carefully than he does

He makes the best appointees. 

• ⁠He should not be allowed to benefit his personal business through executive action

Trump won the election fair and square so he can do whatever he wants with it. Don't like it? That's why we have elections!

• ⁠He should be able to be tried for crimes while in office

It's not illegal when the president does it, he has the power to pardon himself."

Yeah sure, say that while the USA has the highest count of infected while in Kurdistan where I live we closed land borders before Iran even reported the first case. Full-on quarantine and literal curfews on when you can go out and buy things and even then it must only be for essential needs. While we see european citizens dying in the thousands, which is horrible, but to say it's because 'religion peepol stoopid' is about as dumb as you can be since you can very clearly see the countries with highest atheist rates are getting overwhelmed by the pandemic.

And I'm not saying they deserve it or anything like that, I hope this disease didn't spread to begin with, I'm saying these people are so blinded by their hatred of religion they have dismissed the facts, when the irony is that they consider themselves smarter than religious people because they don't believe in god"

The election of Keir Starmer, millionaire ex-lawyer, as leader of the Labour Party, and his subsequent purge of progressives from his cabinet has left many reeling.
 
After four years of Corbynism and hope for progressive change that never seemed to materialise, the return to business-as-usual Blairism is a hard pill for many Labour supporters to swallow.

What can dissaffected progressives do to build a radical movement now that a sharp rightwards turn in the Labour party is inevitable?

Join our online discussion, where we'll be discussing why the Corbyn project failed, why Corbyn capitulated as often as he did, and what the right-wing consolidation pushed by Starmer means for the party. 

We'll also be discussing the history and roots of the Labour Party, and why attempts to build a radical movement in the party were ultimately frustrated.

As always, our hosts will be answering questions from the audience, and we hope to have conversations with as many people as possible. 

Tune in by visiting either our Facebook or Youtube pages, links below:

While we are Nottingham-based, the meeting is of course open to anyone that's interested.

As for the UK's deaths, not all of those 917 yesterday were from that day, there is a lag and earlier deaths that were missed previously get added on each day."
2020-04-12,CallMeZino,conspiracy_commons,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/comments/fyrwj9/could_911_be_a_huge_distraction_for_people_to/fn61rcw/,"I agree that they did not need it to start a war. Countries have been lying to start wars since the beginning of time. They could have told  us that some remote base in the middle east was bombed and that it killed xx number of Americans. We would've been good to go.

I think it had more to do with passing the patriot act. They needed that control of the population. Take away a few more freedoms. Patriot was supposed to be temporary. It is still in effect.

Seems like that is happening again with the coronavirus. We are all prisoners in our homes for a virus which, according to the CDC, has killed fewer people than any annual flu ( CDC stats: 250,000 - 650,000 worldwide annual deaths. 110,000 Covid deaths at the moment - making it half as deadly as the weakest flu ever). Think about that while we are crashing the economy and arrested for walking outside.

So, although I think it was used to take away rights and freedoms, distracting from the discloser project is much more likely than using it as a justification for war. We are ready to go to war pretty easily. But try to distract us from brad and Angelina, or aliens? Need more than a fake bombing story."

I think this is here to stay and we either have immunity after we've had it or we haven't.

If we don't all get a natural immunity then the UK could lose a million people a year to this on an annual basis. Plus the fact of the near total isolation to keep it under control.

This is the very possible outcome that nobody wants to talk about."

A little about myself: I am from Russia, the Moscow region, I am 16 and we recently started to study the beginning of the 19th century (I translated into Google Translate, my English is bad) .. 1 Over the past 100 years a lot of important and interesting things have happened in our country  : creation of the USSR, The Great Patriotic War (First and Second) The collapse of the USSR, but I am proud of the past of our country and its achievements.  2 Mvse or relatives (Mother, father, Grandmother, Grandfather) come from SMS.  My mother says that in her childhood (1980-1990) it was difficult to live because of various problems at that time, Grandfather was born 5 years after the end of the war, and he says that the time of recovery after the war was rather hard on our country, but  he studied for a pilot and his life was much better when compared with the ordinary citizen of the USSR.  The most difficult thing was in the early 90s.  Then even my family had big problems, sometimes it was even difficult to get food and my grandfather brought it from abroad, he also brought his own car to the USSR, the “delivery” of which was more expensive than the car itself (Nissan Skyline 1988, Nissan Sunny 1990 if  I’m not mistaken, then these were the only foreign cars in my city (Notice this is the Moscow Region (district of Stocil) and more than 100 thousand people live in my city) 3 What I think about Germany. I was there, this country is very good, but speaking about  BB2 (WW2), then it doesn’t fit into my head that the country that defeated her, which  Paradise hung its flag on the flagpole in Berlin, it lives much, much worse than the country that lost, many pensioners now consider a trifle to save for food, some even work so far, which is very disappointing when you consider how old they are and what  4 I don’t know much about the Balkan countries, considering that I’m doing geography (I went to the All-Russian Olympiad), it’s very bad: it’s part of Europe (I’m not even sure about it) and that it’s a mountainous area (again  unsure), where it is very beautiful.  I have been to Bulgaria and Greece, but on the island of Crete.  I really liked Bulgaria, because it looks very similar to Russia, but at the same time it doesn’t look like it. I could not explain myself very well to the local population, but we could understand each other.  I was not in Serbia, but I heard that it is very beautiful there.  5 Now coronavirus has spread all over the world and our economy is growing rapidly, for example: in late January and early February, the $ (dollar) exchange rate was about 63-66 ₽ (rubles), and now it is around 78-82.  Prices have risen quite a lot and many more have lost their jobs because of the virus, as it is not profitable for employers to pay them.  Corruption is flourishing very well in our country, many deputies are actively using their position and opportunities, they also steal money from the budget, and are very lazy to help people.  Of course, there are exceptions as the mayor of Yakutia, who can be said from another universe, is a very good and decent person. (How is private sector doing - did not understand, I'm sorry) 6 living in our country is quite difficult: corruption, depreciation and, consequently, price increases,  with a decrease in salary, yes there are pluses: our resorts, for example, but these are trifles compared to disadvantages.  If you live in Moscow and St. Petersburg, then it will be easy and pleasant to live, but if only there, mainly, at the expense of the ethnic component, I don’t care.  We are people and no matter how you are, 6 it’s important what is inside of us: everything is the same, the human soul is also important"

In Scotland they were made under the Coronavirus Act 2020, I'm not sure about NI. 

&nbsp;

The [amendments](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2020/106/regulation/2/made) to the regulations in Scotland essentially fixed a couple of typos.

&nbsp;

I think you could perhaps be a little clearer here about which jurisdictions that applies to. I presume E&W and possibly NI (I can't get the page to load) but there is separate guidance in Scotland, internal and Lord Advocate's Guidelines. A member of the public reading that is probably not going to appreciate that that is not applicable across the whole of the UK which may lead to some confusion. Although the regulations are very similar across the UK the existing police powers up here are quite different (powers of arrest, powers to require details *etc*) which obviously shapes how matters are dealt with."

Stating that there was no need to panic on their availability, the Union Health Ministry said it was not required by everyone involved in coronavirus infection treatment.
Agarwal said, while the government was augmenting the PPE supply, its use was based on the risk profile. ""The PPE is meant for high risk profile patients and not for patients with low and moderate risk,"" he said.
The PPE is not only coverall, but a mix of boot, coverall, head gear and N95 mask. While high risk patients needed full component, for the moderate risk patients mask and gloves were sufficient, he said.
""We have procured sufficient quantities of the PPE and provided them to the state governments. Rationalisation should be exercised in its usage"", Agarwal said.
Agarwal said the meeting of the Group of Ministers (GoM), comprising health, civil aviation, external affairs, home, chemical, shipping and fertilizer Ministers, focused on containment and management efforts. It also took up dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, availability of PPE, ventilators and N95 masks.
He said the GoM emphasised that doctors were like soldiers and they needed the community support, and also the people should not believe fake news as information could be accessed through call centres of the central and the state governments.
Citing the government guidelines, he said the PPE should be made available to medical staff and be used rationally. Agarwal said the Indian Railways had produced about 600,000 reusable face masks and over 4,000 litres of hand sanitiser, and deployed more than 2,500 doctors, 35,000 paramedics.
It had sanctioned nearly 5,000 coaches to be converted into 80,000 isolation beds. Of this, 3,250 coaches had already been converted into isolation stations, he added.
The GoM also directed that Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) should be utilised as per prescription and is not advised for patients with cardiac irregularities or those suffering from cardiac disease which can be harmful.
The Health Ministry also cited the ''adopt a family program'', amid the lockdown, in Karnal district, where local businessmen and those living abroad, have contributed generously to adopt needy families.
""Rs 64 lakhs has been raised, which will take care of 13,000 poorest families throughout the district. Efforts are also being made to distribute 90,000 meals per day to vulnerable groups. Technology such as dedicated ''Karnal Live Tracker'' to track the home quarantines & also an online local delivery app ''Need on Wheels (NOW) have been facilitated by the local district administration to procure vegetable/fruit wholesalers & dairies"", said the ministry in a statement."

Federer, who with eight titles is the most successful male singles player in the tournament''s history, urges fans to support the medical workers who are currently in the frontline of the global fight against coronavirus.
The pandemic has killed over 85,000 around the world and led to cancellation or postponement of sports events, including the 2020 Olympics. The Wimbledon was cancelled this year for the first time since the Second World War.
""Since 1877 Wimbledon fans have embraced The Championships,"" Federer says in the video. ""You have watched through multiple types of screen at all hours of the day and night. Descended from afar. Even queued. My, how you have queued. This summer sadly, we must come together by staying apart. No tents will be pitched, no records broken, no trophies engraved.
""But as we say thank you for your passion and support, we remind ourselves that countless champions will be crowned. As frontline workers across the globe compete for us, we cheer for them. For now with play suspended, we are united in hope that tomorrow will be better than today."""

March 24: PM Modi announces nationwide lockdown for 21 days. No public gatherings, any kind of non-essential movement outside residences allowed. Only essential services allowed to remain functional.

March 24: Nizamuddin Police asks remaining people at the Markaz to vacate the area.

March 25: Around 1000 people are still residing in the area defying lockdown orders. A medical team visits the Markaz and suspected cases are isolated in a hall within the building.

and to sum it up  

[A case has been registered against two members of Tablighi Jamaat for allegedly defecating in front of a room at a quarantine centre in Narela here, police said on Tuesday. The accused men are residents of Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh and has attended the religious congregation held last month at Nizamuddin, they said.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/jamaat-members-defecate-in-front-of-narela-quarantine-centre-room/articleshow/75023539.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst&fbclid=IwAR0NCU1w-5g7PZt6LqCyBJDo0bhcvivNl04LDDQuuG6WX7WUnIj-6aZwQbs&from=mdr)


Between 27 February and 1 March 2020, they organised an international mass religious gathering at the Sri Petaling Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which has been linked to more than 600 COVID-19 cases, making it the largest-known centre of transmission of the virus in Southeast Asia.

It was all over reddit and international news. This was a big PR disaster for the Tablighi Jamaat people as they faced wrath of multiple south eastern countries who were affected by this. This single event spread the virus to dozens of countries. This is not a news anyone in that group can ""miss"" as it affected them so much. I am sure every single Tablighi Jamaat person who was in Delhi event knew about this.

Despite the outbreak, Tablighi Jammat organised a second international mass gathering on 18 March in Gowa Regency near Makassar in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Though the organisers initially rebuffed official directives to cancel the gathering, they subsequently complied and cancelled the gathering.

Nizamuddin faction of the Tablighi Jamaat held a religious congregational program in Nizamuddin West, Delhi from 13 to 15 March 2020 before pan-India lockdown was announced which was attended by several foreign speakers and over 500 members. It is suspected that some of these speakers were infected by the Coronavirus which later spread to the congregants.

In Pakistan, 36 Tableeghi Jamaat members tested positive in Hyderabad, Pakistan on 30 March. 1000s more are suspected and common people in Pakistan are ostracizing people of Tableeghi Jamaat due to fear of coronavirus.

These are the known places. It is very possible that they have infected in Bangladesh and several other countries like Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

The thing is that even after knowing they were infected and caused such a massive problem in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonasia, two weeks later, they did a similar event in Delhi. Another bad thing is that even after knowing about this outbreak in Malaysia originating from this group, India failed to stop them from doing an event in India.

Agustus hopefully kehidupan mulai normal, tapi bukan berarti virusnya hilang 100%. Wearing masks will be the new norm. Hand sanitizers and other hygienic habits will be adopted as the new normal. Work from home will be utilized more, especially to occupations that can do it (maybe there will be shifts). Pocket outbreaks might happen, and local lockdowns could be implemented. Or we could go with phased PSBB/lockdowns - when there is already a small rising trend in numbers of infected, PSBB/lockdown will be done temporarily, then reopened again. 

I find it hard to believe that there will be a big second or third wave. I hope my prediction aged nicely, or well, my statement might end up like Mr. The Cloudest. So far this virus is not said to mutate THAT much, one vaccine should be able to fight off all strains, and again, this is a coronavirus, a different family of virus compared to the spanish flu. The last coronavirus outbreak (SARS) didn't come with a second or third wave. 

But then again, this strain is highly infectious and less lethal than the 2003 SARS - so maybe there could be a second wave after all - who knows. I'm not ruling out that possibility but now my stupid ass laymen brain tends to think that there won't be a second wave.

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-04-10/coronavirus-infection-can-do-lasting-damage-to-the-heart-liver

For a world grappling with the new coronavirus, it’s becoming increasingly clear that even when the pandemic is over, it won’t really be over.

Now doctors are beginning to worry that for patients who have survived COVID-19, the same may be true.

For the sickest patients, infection with the new coronavirus is proving to be a full-body assault, causing damage well beyond the lungs. And even after patients who become severely ill have recovered and cleared the virus, physicians have begun seeing evidence of the infection’s lingering effects.

In a study posted this week, scientists in China examined the blood test results of 34 COVID-19 patients over the course of their hospitalization. In those who survived mild and severe disease alike, the researchers found that many of the biological measures had “failed to return to normal.” 

Chief among the worrisome test results were readings that suggested these apparently recovered patients continued to have impaired liver function. That was the case even after two tests for the live virus had come back negative and the patients were cleared to be discharged.

At the same time, as cardiologists are contending with the immediate effects of COVID-19 on the heart, they’re asking how much of the damage could be long-lasting. In an early study of COVID-19 patients in China, heart failure was seen in nearly 12% of those who survived, including in some who had shown no signs of respiratory distress."

Japanese and Japanese supporters like you have a relationship that is so far removed from the truth. To the Japanese, comfort women = lie. To the Japanese, Rape of Nanking = lie. 

Abe and the Japanese lied about the coronavirus numbers because they didn't want their precious Olympics, the ones that were obtained by bribery so blatant the French charged the Japanese with corruption

>It's also weak to blame Japan for all the anti koreanness in Asia; I've been to China, and they pretty much dislike Korean due to the arrogance of their tourists and expats. It is not a secret that many Koreans are very proud of their nationality, to the point Where it becomes arrogant in the eyes of many.

That's a lie. Give me evidence of this. Your anecdotes are not enough. When were the Chinese anti-Korean through their demonstrations? The Chinese did have [anti-Japanese demonstrations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_China_anti-Japanese_demonstrations) Where were the anti-Korean demonstrations? Also, people say the same thing about Chinese tourists and American tourists, that they're arrogant and act like ""kings.""

>There are some minority who are actively Korea bashing, but you will never be able to have a Nationwide boycott like in Korea, because Japanese really don't care enough.

It's not a minority who are actively Korea bashing. It's Abe and the politicians who are encouraging anti-Korean sentiment, through things like the radar dispute, the comfort women dispute, and the forced labor dispute. Also your reading comprehension is lacking because I clearly said the Japanese don't buy anything in terms of products from SK, so you can't boycott something you don't buy. I didn't say ""Japan does not import from Korea,"" I said there's a significant trade deficit and they're rivals in the same industry, so there's no reason to buy Korean cars or electronics."

India's Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov held a telephonic conversation on Thursday to discuss the evolving situation related to the spread of the deadly virus.
Both of them exchanged notes on the national efforts underway in their respective countries to contain the outbreak of Covid-19.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the issue through a teleconference last month on March 25.
Shringla and Morgulov stressed on the close bilateral cooperation between the two countries in ensuring the welfare of each other''s citizens in their respective countries. There are around 15,000 Indian students in Russia and about 5,000 Russian tourists in India. Morgulov also thanked Shringla for facilitating the evacuation of Russian nationals from India.
Referring to the Russian chairmanship of BRICS and SCO, Morgulov informed Shringla of various preparatory meetings which would continue to take place through video conferencing in the coming days.
The telephonic discussion between Shringla and Morgulov came two days after India, in view of the humanitarian aspects of the pandemic, decided to lift the ban on the export of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). HCQ is being used to treat Covid-19 patients and as prophylactic by the frontline healthcare workers deployed in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The Modi government had imposed a ban on export of the drug since the coronavirus outbreak hit India.
The government is now licencing paracetamol and HCQ in appropriate quantities to neighbouring countries which are dependent on Indian capabilities and also supplying the drugs to the US and some other nations badly affected by the pandemic.
Russia as of now has over 10,000 Covid-19 positive cases while 76 people have succumbed to the dreaded virus. In India, 186 people have died so far while over 6,200 persons have tested positive for Covid-19."

On 10 February, the Netherlands helped to send a plane full of masks, gloves, overalls and other medical devices on a 'humanitarian flight' via Schiphol to Wuhan, China. This is shown by a reconstruction of the Volkskrant to the month of February in which it became clear that the Netherlands was not well prepared for the outbreak of the coronavirus.

The Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands, Xu Hong, had asked the Netherlands for help in organising the flight and arranging landing rights. It is remarkable that the Netherlands agreed with the Chinese request. A few days earlier, the World Health Organization already warned of a 'worldwide shortage of protective equipment'. Yet in February millions of mouth caps, gloves and protective equipment went to China. 

A Dutch trader said he bought '5 to 6 million mouth caps, 100,000 overalls and ten breathing machines' in the Netherlands, Germany and Turkey. The trader: 'I've been carrying things that came from China to the Netherlands in October and are now going back. A civil servant involved says looking back on the flight: 'We thought we were invulnerable'.

In an official response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated: 'It was a humanitarian flight that came to collect relief items collected by the Chinese embassy and companies. At the request of the Chinese authorities, the Netherlands facilitated the provision of landing rights for this aircraft'.

At the end of February, RIVM boss Jaap van Dissel also identified major shortages in the Netherlands. In a memo to the senior civil servant of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport he warns of the worldwide scarcity of protective equipment. Van Dissel: 'The media must draw attention to the importance of good use of scarce personal protective equipment and unnecessary use must be reduced'."

In Taiwan, Hsing Yun is notable for his activity in political affairs, particularly as a supporter of the One-China policy as well as government legislation supported by the Kuomintang, and has been criticized for his views by those in favor of Taiwan independence and by religious figures, as being overtly political and ""considerably far afield from traditional monastic concerns"". During the 2008 presidential election, Hsing Yun publicly endorsed Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou. During the second World Buddhist Forum in 2009, Hsing Yun asserted that there are ""no Taiwanese"" and that Taiwanese ""are Chinese"". In 2012 he said that the Senkaku Islands (also known as the Diaoyutai Islands) belonged to China.

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

•	⁠Trump should have acted swiftly to combat the coronavirus when he had the time and chance to months ago
•	⁠He should stop spreading either unproven or misinformed facts about how to cure covid-19 / it's current progress
•	⁠He should encourage release greater stimulus towards working members of society, not large corporations that have overextended themselves
•	⁠He should stop using Twitter as a means of official communication
•	⁠He should maintain the USPS's funding
•	⁠He should not separate families at the border
•	⁠He should cooperate with Congressional subpoena
•	⁠He should not engage in uneconomical trade wars
•	⁠He should not try to maintain coal as a dominant power source
•	⁠He should not disrespect war veterans
•	⁠He should not pardon convicted war criminals
•	⁠He should not retaliate against military officers taking action to maintain the health of their subordinates
•	⁠He should not mock the disabled
•	⁠He should involve his administration in more renewable energy investment
•	⁠He should not fraternize with dictators
•	⁠He should not lie as frequently as he does
•	⁠He should not ban immigration from countries on religious basis
•	⁠He should consider his appointees more carefully than he does
•	⁠He should not be allowed to benefit his personal business through executive action

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

And it’s not just about the risk to you or to your date; either one of you could have coronavirus (no matter how careful you’d been) and be a symptomatic. Given that Covid doesn’t tend to show symptoms for 5-7 days and that it’s highly contagious, mixing separate households absolutely is a huge risk factor - and it’s not just dangerous to you, you’re endangering your entire community by enabling the spread. The risks of social isolation can be mitigated by virtual interactions and other mental health coping mechanisms like exercise, meditation, etc. The risks of spreading the virus can’t be mitigated if you’re meeting up and touching people outside of your own home. 

I have three friends with the virus in my city. One (a healthy marathon runner in her early 40s) is in hospital. Another friend, also healthy and in his early 40s, got it despite leaving his own property only 4 times in 19 days; he’s not yet in hospital but he’s very sick and not out of the woods yet.

I believe these students are entitled and should absolutely not get a refund. Business schools aren't able to provide the best learning and student experience due to the coronavirus, not due to their lack of trying or capabilities. I see it as someone asking a carmaker for a refund because now they can't really use their car anymore. It's not the carmaker's fault, it's the buyer's fault or at least the buyer's risk to bear. Those students are now trying to tarnish the business school's reputation (their most valuable asset) as retaliation and also said that ""now they won't get a job out of school because of the economic environment, they can't justify paying the school fees"". How these entitled students don't see where they are at fault mind boggles me."

Her response was blunt: “People are carrying the virus everywhere.”

>The following day, Dr. Kadlec and the others decided to present Mr. Trump with a plan titled “Four Steps to Mitigation,” telling the president that they needed to begin preparing Americans for a step rarely taken in United States history.

>But over the next several days, a presidential blowup and internal turf fights would sidetrack such a move. The focus would shift to messaging and confident predictions of success rather than publicly calling for a shift to mitigation.

>These final days of February, perhaps more than any other moment during his tenure in the White House, illustrated Mr. Trump’s inability or unwillingness to absorb warnings coming at him. He instead reverted to his traditional political playbook in the midst of a public health calamity, squandering vital time as the coronavirus spread silently across the country.

>Dr. Kadlec’s group wanted to meet with the president right away, but Mr. Trump was on a trip to India, so they agreed to make the case to him in person as soon as he returned two days later. If they could convince him of the need to shift strategy, they could immediately begin a national education campaign aimed at preparing the public for the new reality.

>A memo dated Feb. 14, prepared in coordination with the National Security Council and titled “U.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus,” documented what more drastic measures would look like, including: “significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone. Consider school closures. Widespread ‘stay at home’ directives from public and private organizations with nearly 100% telework for some.”

>The memo did not advocate an immediate national shutdown, but said the targeted use of “quarantine and isolation measures” could be used to slow the spread in places where “sustained human-to-human transmission” is evident.

>Within 24 hours, before they got a chance to make their presentation to the president, the plan went awry.

>Mr. Trump was walking up the steps of Air Force One to head home from India on Feb. 25 when Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, publicly issued the blunt warning they had all agreed was necessary.

>But Dr. Messonnier had jumped the gun. They had not told the president yet, much less gotten his consent.

>On the 18-hour plane ride home, Mr. Trump fumed as he watched the stock market crash after Dr. Messonnier’s comments. Furious, he called Mr. Azar when he landed at around 6 a.m. on Feb. 26, raging that Dr. Messonnier had scared people unnecessarily. Already on thin ice with the president over a variety of issues and having overseen the failure to quickly produce an effective and widely available test, Mr. Azar would soon find his authority reduced.

>The meeting that evening with Mr. Trump to advocate social distancing was canceled, replaced by a news conference in which the president announced that the White House response would be put under the command of Vice President Mike Pence.

>The push to convince Mr. Trump of the need for more assertive action stalled. With Mr. Pence and his staff in charge, the focus was clear: no more alarmist messages. Statements and media appearances by health officials like Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield would be coordinated through Mr. Pence’s office. It would be more than three weeks before Mr. Trump would announce serious social distancing efforts, a lost period during which the spread of the virus accelerated rapidly.

>Over nearly three weeks from Feb. 26 to March 16, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States grew from 15 to 4,226. Since then, nearly half a million Americans have tested positive for the virus and authorities say hundreds of thousands more are likely infected.

>The earliest warnings about coronavirus got caught in the crosscurrents of the administration’s internal disputes over China. It was the China hawks who pushed earliest for a travel ban. But their animosity toward China also undercut hopes for a more cooperative approach by the world’s two leading powers to a global crisis.

>It was early January, and the call with a Hong Kong epidemiologist left Matthew Pottinger rattled.

>Mr. Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser and a hawk on China, took a blunt warning away from the call with the doctor, a longtime friend: A ferocious, new outbreak that on the surface appeared similar to the SARS epidemic of 2003 had emerged in China. It had spread far more quickly than the government was admitting to, and it wouldn’t be long before it reached other parts of the world.

>Mr. Pottinger had worked as a Wall Street Journal correspondent in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic, and was still scarred by his experience documenting the death spread by that highly contagious virus.

>Now, seventeen years later, his friend had a blunt message: You need to be ready. The virus, he warned, which originated in the city of Wuhan, was being transmitted by people who were showing no symptoms — an insight that American health officials had not yet accepted. Mr. Pottinger declined through a spokesman to comment.

>It was one of the earliest warnings to the White House, and it echoed the intelligence reports making their way to the National Security Council. While most of the early assessments from the C.I.A. had little more information than was available publicly, some of the more specialized corners of the intelligence world were producing sophisticated and chilling warnings.

>In a report to the director of national intelligence, the State Department’s epidemiologist wrote in early January that the virus was likely to spread across the globe, and warned that the coronavirus could develop into a pandemic. Working independently, a small outpost of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Center for Medical Intelligence, came to the same conclusion. Within weeks after getting initial information about the virus early in the year, biodefense experts inside the National Security Council, looking at what was happening in Wuhan, started urging officials to think about what would be needed to quarantine a city the size of Chicago.

>By mid-January there was growing evidence of the virus spreading outside China. Mr. Pottinger began convening daily meetings about the coronavirus. He alerted his boss, Robert C. O’Brien, the national security adviser.

>The early alarms sounded by Mr. Pottinger and other China hawks were freighted with ideology — including a push to publicly blame China that critics in the administration say was a distraction as the coronavirus spread to Western Europe and eventually the United States.

>And they ran into opposition from Mr. Trump’s economic advisers, who worried a tough approach toward China could scuttle a trade deal that was a pillar of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.

>With his skeptical — some might even say conspiratorial — view of China’s ruling Communist Party, Mr. Pottinger initially suspected that President Xi Jinping’s government was keeping a dark secret: that the virus may have originated in one of the laboratories in Wuhan studying deadly pathogens. In his view, it might have even been a deadly accident unleashed on an unsuspecting Chinese population.

>During meetings and telephone calls, Mr. Pottinger asked intelligence agencies — including officers at the C.I.A. working on Asia and on weapons of mass destruction — to search for evidence that might bolster his theory.

>They didn’t have any evidence. Intelligence agencies did not detect any alarm inside the Chinese government that analysts presumed would accompany the accidental leak of a deadly virus from a government laboratory. But Mr. Pottinger continued to believe the coronavirus problem was far worse than the Chinese were acknowledging. Inside the West Wing, the director of the Domestic Policy Council, Joe Grogan, also tried to sound alarms that the threat from China was growing.

>Mr. Pottinger, backed by Mr. O’Brien, became one of the driving forces of a campaign in the final weeks of January to convince Mr. Trump to impose limits on travel from China — the first substantive step taken to impede the spread of the virus and one that the president has repeatedly cited as evidence that he was on top of the problem.

>In addition to the opposition from the economic team, Mr. Pottinger and his allies among the China hawks had to overcome initial skepticism from the administration’s public health experts.

>Travel restrictions were usually counterproductive to managing biological outbreaks because they prevented doctors and other much-needed medical help from easily getting to the affected areas, the health officials said. And such bans often cause infected people to flee, spreading the disease further."

The World Health Organization had declared a global public health emergency and American officials had discovered the first confirmed case of person-to-person transmission inside the United States.

>The economic team, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, continued to argue that there were big risks in taking a provocative step toward China and moving to curb global travel. After a debate, Mr. Trump came down on the side of the hawks and the public health team. The limits on travel from China were publicly announced on Jan. 31.

>Still, Mr. Trump and other senior officials were wary of further upsetting Beijing. Besides the concerns about the impact on the trade deal, they knew that an escalating confrontation was risky because the United States relies heavily on China for pharmaceuticals and the kinds of protective equipment most needed to combat the coronavirus.

>But the hawks kept pushing in February to take a critical stance toward China amid the growing crisis. Mr. Pottinger and others — including aides to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — pressed for government statements to use the term “Wuhan Virus.”

>Mr. Pompeo tried to hammer the anti-China message at every turn, eventually even urging leaders of the Group of 7 industrialized countries to use “Wuhan virus” in a joint statement.

>Others, including aides to Mr. Pence, resisted taking a hard public line, believing that angering Beijing might lead the Chinese government to withhold medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and any scientific research that might ultimately lead to a vaccine.

>Mr. Trump took a conciliatory approach through the middle of March, praising the job Mr. Xi was doing.

>That changed abruptly, when aides informed Mr. Trump that a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman had publicly spun a new conspiracy about the origins of Covid-19: that it was brought to China by U.S. Army personnel who visited the country last October.

>Mr. Trump was furious, and he took to his favorite platform to broadcast a new message. On March 16, he wrote on Twitter that “the United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus.”

>Mr. Trump’s decision to escalate the war of words undercut any remaining possibility of broad cooperation between the governments to address a global threat. It remains to be seen whether that mutual suspicion will spill over into efforts to develop treatments or vaccines, both areas where the two nations are now competing.

>One immediate result was a free-for-all across the United States, with state and local governments and hospitals bidding on the open market for scarce but essential Chinese-made products. When the state of Massachusetts managed to procure 1.2 million masks, it fell to the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert K. Kraft, a Trump ally, to cut through extensive red tape on both sides of the Pacific to send his own plane to pick them up.

>The chaotic culture of the Trump White House contributed to the crisis. A lack of planning and a failure to execute, combined with the president’s focus on the news cycle and his preference for following his gut rather than the data cost time, and perhaps lives.

>Inside the West Wing, Mr. Navarro, Mr. Trump’s trade adviser, was widely seen as quick-tempered, self-important and prone to butting in. He is among the most outspoken of China hawks and in late January was clashing with the administration’s health experts over limiting travel from China.

>So it elicited eye rolls when, after initially being prevented from joining the coronavirus task force, he circulated a memo on Jan. 29 urging Mr. Trump to impose the travel limits, arguing that failing to confront the outbreak aggressively could be catastrophic, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses.

>The uninvited message could not have conflicted more with the president’s approach at the time of playing down the severity of the threat. And when aides raised it with Mr. Trump, he responded that he was unhappy that Mr. Navarro had put his warning in writing.

>From the time the virus was first identified as a concern, the administration’s response was plagued by the rivalries and factionalism that routinely swirl around Mr. Trump and, along with the president’s impulsiveness, undercut decision making and policy development.

>Faced with the relentless march of a deadly pathogen, the disagreements and a lack of long-term planning had significant consequences. They slowed the president’s response and resulted in problems with execution and planning, including delays in seeking money from Capitol Hill and a failure to begin broad surveillance testing.

>The efforts to shape Mr. Trump’s view of the virus began early in January, when his focus was elsewhere: the fallout from his decision to kill Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s security mastermind; his push for an initial trade deal with China; and his Senate impeachment trial, which was about to begin.

>Even after Mr. Azar first briefed him about the potential seriousness of the virus during a phone call on Jan. 18 while the president was at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump projected confidence that it would be a passing problem.

>“We have it totally under control,” he told an interviewer a few days later while attending the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. “It’s going to be just fine.”

>Back in Washington, voices outside of the White House peppered Mr. Trump with competing assessments about what he should do and how quickly he should act.

>The efforts to sort out policy behind closed doors were contentious and sometimes only loosely organized.

>That was the case when the National Security Council convened a meeting on short notice on the afternoon of Jan. 27. The Situation Room was standing room only, packed with top White House advisers, low-level staffers, Mr. Trump’s social media guru, and several cabinet secretaries. There was no checklist about the preparations for a possible pandemic, which would require intensive testing, rapid acquisition of protective gear, and perhaps serious limitations on Americans’ movements.

>Instead, after a 20-minute description by Mr. Azar of his department’s capabilities, the meeting was jolted when Stephen E. Biegun, the newly installed deputy secretary of state, announced plans to issue a “level four” travel warning, strongly discouraging Americans from traveling to China. The room erupted into bickering.

>A few days later, on the evening of Jan. 30, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff at the time, and Mr. Azar called Air Force One as the president was making the final decision to go ahead with the restrictions on China travel. Mr. Azar was blunt, warning that the virus could develop into a pandemic and arguing that China should be criticized for failing to be transparent.

>Mr. Trump rejected the idea of criticizing China, saying the country had enough to deal with. And if the president’s decision on the travel restrictions suggested that he fully grasped the seriousness of the situation, his response to Mr. Azar indicated otherwise.

>Stop panicking, Mr. Trump told him.

>That sentiment was present throughout February, as the president’s top aides reached for a consistent message but took few concrete steps to prepare for the possibility of a major public health crisis.

>During a briefing on Capitol Hill on Feb. 5, senators urged administration officials to take the threat more seriously. Several asked if the administration needed additional money to help local and state health departments prepare.

>Derek Kan, a senior official from the Office of Management and Budget, replied that the administration had all the money it needed, at least at that point, to stop the virus, two senators who attended the briefing said.

>“Just left the Administration briefing on Coronavirus,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote in a tweet shortly after. “Bottom line: they aren’t taking this seriously enough.”

>The administration also struggled to carry out plans it did agree on. In mid-February, with the effort to roll out widespread testing stalled, Mr. Azar announced a plan to repurpose a flu-surveillance system in five major cities to help track the virus among the general population. The effort all but collapsed even before it got started as Mr. Azar struggled to win approval for $100 million in funding and the C.D.C. failed to make reliable tests available.

>The number of infections in the United States started to surge through February and early March, but the Trump administration did not move to place large-scale orders for masks and other protective equipment, or critical hospital equipment, such as ventilators. The Pentagon sat on standby, awaiting any orders to help provide temporary hospitals or other assistance."

However, I think the comparison with AIDS is way excessive. What makes AIDS so scary is that it's permanent. In contrast, people recover from the coronavirus after a few weeks, and at this stage everything points to them being immune afterwards (though the duration of immunity is unclear/unknown)."

January 20: “I know more about viruses than anyone.”

January 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

February 2: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

February 25: “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

February 28: “The Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus.” “This is their new hoax.”

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

March 13: “National emergency, two big words.”

March 16: “I would rate it a 10.”… out of 10. “I think we have done a great job.” “It started with the fact that we have kept a very highly infected country, despite all of even the professionals saying it is too early to do this, we were very early with respect to China.

Dems are doing nothing to stop Trump. Ivanna said many years ago that Trump kept a book of Hitler's speeches, I believe by his bed. Trump threatens this elite club because he is exactly the kind of monster that their system supports. He exposes white supremacy. He exposes that just because you have money or connections or a confident tone, doesn't mean you have intelligence. Trump and his repub cronies may try to suspend our elections and Pelosi is complicit and helping by not doing anything real to stop them.

I hope the mods do not remove this comment through being political. I am a student of history and I am not a part of any major political parties, nor have I been for a long time. It's just an observation that I'm making, that is seems like most of these elite Democrats and elite Republicans are batting for the same team. because, I, as a simpleton, can read the Constitution, and see that the Democrats have allowed Trump to do what he does. But they rolled the dice one too many times in coronavirus struck, and unfortunately we are all trapped in the middle of their political game."

In light of the recent events regarding the global spread of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19), we are mandating a minimum distancing between comments. To that end we are requiring that all comments be a minimum of 5,000 characters to ensure that there is a safe distance between users at all times. Please help us by ensuring that your commentary meets this minimum requirement. Attempts to circumvent this will see users quarantined from the subreddit. 

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

Even if it is her only chance to get married it's still not worth putting people's lives at risk, in the grand scheme of things getting married is not that important. She should count herself lucky that she found love and found her fiancé and stop putting all her focus on signing a (relatively) insignificant piece of paper. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people all over the world have postponed their weddings and any one of them could die of coronavirus and never get the chance to get married. None of them are selfish enough to go ahead with it anyway."

But to say ""the private sector is the only thing getting us through the coronavirus pandemic.."" that's just bullshit. There are innumerable ways that both the private and public sectors are working here. The public sector has been urging people to distance themselves, stay home, and use masks when possible. The public sector is involved in the procurement and dispersal of PPE for hospitals. Medicare and Medicaid are involved in paying the doctors, nurses and everybody else in the hospitals. The private sector in the case of the actual Healthcare is actually more of a drag on efficiency and effectiveness, because they are more concerned with getting insurance payments and turning profits for the hospitals. Medicare for All would ensure that all these people were compensated fully without any of the drag of hospital administrators trying to find money and demoralize doctors by humiliating them while wearing PPE in hallways.

Of course the private sector is useful. Not all forms of socialism are about central state control of things. This is just a bad-faith point from start to finish. Feck off."

I want to be clear that invasive ventilators and non-invasive ventilators are not even remotely similar in actual function as one relates to airway pressure and the other to the actual pressure inside the lungs and lung inflation. You can’t substitute one for the other and even if you could, CPAP and BIPAP would still be less helpful than increased O2/L per minute. You can do so much more for a coronavirus patient by just increasing their liters per minute as this increases oxygen concentration in the lungs, which as we see coronavirus attacking blood heme groups we know that concentration may be the more important factor then lung muscle assistance (the kind provided by a ventilator which inflates your lungs rather than having your diaphragm and external and internal intercostals doing the work of inflating and deflating you’re lungs for breathing).

CPAP just makes sure that your airway is not compressed or obstructed while sleeping or laying down, hence why they are used for sleep apnea where a person has full lung function but some type of airway compression or obstruction is present. They cannot be used on coronavirus patients full stop, as they do not treat respiratory, but rather esophageal inhalation and exhalation issues, typically while sleeping.

Any doctor claiming otherwise is either paid off, a quack, or both.

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

2020-04-12,commodorenorrington,coronavirusme,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirusme/comments/fzx5cs/political_brew_martial_law_in_maine_leadership_or/fn6j95l/,"There's a phenomenon in political history called ""Authoritarian Creep."" The idea is that, over time, within political frameworks, governments slowly gain power. Because when various crises happen that require more quick and decisive ""leadership,"" democratic systems empower leadership temporarily, and those powers never get returned. This phenomenon can be observed in virtually every major nation in history, and is one of the prime examples of history repeating itself. 

The problem with Authoritarian Creep isn't necessarily that democratic populations have concerns that their immediate leadership will misuse their ""temporary"" liberties. I actually have quite a bit of faith in Governor Mills. The problem is that, as we increasingly empower central governmental authorities, eventually we're going to have leadership that *will* abuse these powers. 

The current federal government is a great example. Whether you're pro or anti-Trump, you can't deny that Trump has taken advantage of a system that has become largely dependent on ""decorum"" to keep the executive office from reaching beyond their classically understood range of authority. Pro Trumpers are ecstatic he's taking advantage of this to be a strong authority and advance Republican causes in the face of outcry and opposition. Anti Trumpers are obviously dismayed for the same reasons. 

So the problem with situations like this is that this state of de facto Martial Law, while potentially warranted in this particular situation, sets the stage for future executive authorities to abuse this power based on the precedent we're starting now. 

I know it's easy to decry this as tin-foil-hate paranoia. But Hungary's prime minister has literally leveraged [coronavirus to implement a de-facto dictatorship.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-europe/how-viktor-orban-used-the-coronavirus-to-seize-more-power) Adolf Hitler used the exact same method, leveraging the Reichstag fire as an excuse to turn a democratic nation into an authoritarian one. 

My point is that as much as we are applauding our state, local, and federal government's ""leadership"" right now, history tells us that this is the path to authoritarianism that has been trodden by once-democratic nations like Rome since the dawn of political thought. 

I am absolutely certain that we are entering an age of authoritarianism, which inexorably brings with it war, increasing inequality, rising aristocracy, and exploitation. And unfortunately, it's activity like this that's *meant to do good* that paves the way for it.

Tl;dr: People might be applauding government's strong hand against coronavirus right now. But it is already setting a precedent for increasing authoritarianism that history suggests will pave the way for increasing geopolitical tensions and bad times for the already disenfranchised many."

No, you are irresponsible people that are risking the health of yours and others and might prolong the outbreak which will result in more stricter quarantine/lockdown."

She had just been blackpilled by her political savior dropping out, so it shouldn't come as a surprise. She did admit she was wrong about her theory of Bernie's/the left's electability. 

It wouldn't be the first time she acted petulantly, but so does Rich on occasion.

Though I rarely agree with her, I actually appreciate Liz. She's a very catholic leftist, which is rare, and so she provides an uncommon POV. She also called out people's callousness regarding memes calling the coronavirus ""boomer remover"" and whatnot, which honestly hasn't been criticized enough"

The coronavirus is far from the most devastating thing happening in China and I hope for the people's sake they manage to overthrow the CCP sooner rather than later. Of course, the virus is a convenient excuse to shut down the Hong Kong protests so I don't like the odds.

Also, to clarify, I don't think abortion is murder, but the systemic abortion of a specific group solely because they belong to that group has a similar cultural effect to genocide."

Please cite where they claim 100 cases when there was 10,000.

>The evidence is highly suggestive that the outbreak is associated  with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan. The market was closed on 1  January 2020. At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare  workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission. The  Chinese authorities continue their work of intensive surveillance and  follow up measures, as well as further epidemiological investigations. 

They said they had no *evidence* of H2H back in January 11-12th.  If they didn't, they didn't.  I don't see an incentive for them to lie about that either.  It isn't as if you can pretend forever."

Again, it always boils down to limiting speech to protect the stupid who would damage themselves or their children, but those people shouldn't have children, and the state tends to concur. If it's not anti-vax theories or coronavirus theories they'll latch on to something else and the damage will still be done while you play whack-a-mole."
