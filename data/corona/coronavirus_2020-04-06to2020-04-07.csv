This is going to be a long one, and sourcing things takes time -- doubly so, given that this is a story that hinges on whether something is or is not misinformation. Please treat this as a work in progress while this disclaimer is up.

Let's start with the simple fact that **there is no real evidence to suggest that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19**. That's not bias; it's science. It may turn out that it *is* an effective treatment -- and there are studies currently working on seeing if that's true; we'll get to those later -- but as yet we're a long, *long* way from that. That's how science is done. It's straight-up irresponsible to recommend a drug that is unproven and untested and may not be effective at all (if not actively harmful). That's why Trump has come in for a lot of criticism -- because he's been pushing hydroxychloroquine *hard*.

#What is hydroxychloroquine, anyway?

It's a drug [used worldwide to treat malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxychloroquine), specifically when the usual treatment for malaria -- chloroquine -- has proven to be ineffective (due to resistance). It's a very important drug worldwide, to put it mildly; it's considered safe and effective for its intended purpose -- the WHO have it on their [List of Essential Medicines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines) (basically an overall recommendation list for medicines that have proven their worth), and even in the USA it's widely prescribed, almost always for other diseases. Like a lot of drugs it has multiple uses; in the case of hydroxychloroquine, it's also very effective in the treatment of lupus and rheumatic diseases.

#What does it have to do with COVID-19?

Treatment for COVID-19 -- the disease caused by the coronavirus -- would fall under the category of an [off-label use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-label_use). That's not to say that off-label uses are always ineffective, but they haven't been properly vetted and may cause significant problems. As yet, there is some anecdotal evidence that hydroxychloroquine can, in some cases and in combination with other drugs, help cure COVID-19. Also as yet, anecdotal vidence is (*mostly*) all we've got. There has been a small study out of France that confirmed these findings -- ['that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin'](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996) (an antibiotic) -- and that has prompted [a major study from the WHO](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/who-launches-global-megatrial-four-most-promising-coronavirus-treatments), but we're not at the stage where we can say that the science is in."

Media accountability is good, although litigation may not be the perfect vehicle for this."

“Currently, ten different therapeutic agents are in active trials and some are looking incredibly successful,” he said. “But they have to go through a process and it’s going to be a quick process based on what the FDA told me.” He said another 15 potential treatments are working toward clinical trials, “so they’re advancing rapidly.”

The people who stock your grocery store, or who bring food to your door are coming into contact with many people. Their odds of being exposed to Coronavirus are much higher than someone unemployed at home. Just being at work makes them more likely to get sick, and maybe die.

If they all decided to not show up, then there would be nowhere for people to buy food. And then ask yourself what happens when a lot of hungry people have no legal access to get food (riots, looting).

And yet, these occupations get minimum wage. They are keeping everything together. They could die. Hazard pay is how someone gets fairly compensated for risking their health and safety to do a job. Therefore, they should be receiving hazard pay."

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-07/coronavirus-cases-increase-victoria-as-schools-reopen-next-week/12127176

Key Points:

* Students who can learn from home, **must** do so, however

* Schools will **remain open** for kids who do not have access to technology, or whose parents cannot supervise them

* School buses and student disability transport, and metro transport will run as normal

* The Government will work with Food Bank to make sure every child who needs the support of breakfast clubs and lunches gets it.

* **Most** teachers would also work from home, and priority would be given to staff with underlying health issues.

* Small groups of VCE and VCAL students can also attend schools for short periods if learning cannot be carried out at home.

* All learning will be online, so even the kids who are still attending schools will have to attend classes digitally. Teachers will not have to teach both physical classes at school and digital classes online.

This is a really good compromise between the ""Schools must stay open because there are kids who can't learn from home"" and ""Schools must close to prevent the spread of the virus"" arguments. It sounds like schools will have a caretaker staff (most likely Educational Support staff and senior leadership) to take care of kids who cannot learn from home, while everyone else (including most of the teachers) will learn/teach from home."

Coronavirus manages to infect 70% or so of the global population, as has been outlined in several  projections. Of those 70%, the 20% who would be in critical or severe condition would die due to hospitals becoming severely overwhelmed.

The (almost) billion deaths over the course of a month or two would result in the failure of several global supply chains, killing several millions more.

The global economy would also collapse, leading to roots, looting, and the failure of infrastructure. World governments would collapse as the world descends into anarchy.

Everyone is afraid to leave their family homes or venture too close to other settlements due to fear of raiders or looters, despite most people being decent people.

This isolation, not imposed by government or doctors but by fear, would halt the spread of coronavirus. Eventually, it would completely die out.

>The Israeli behavior as it pertains to coronavirus has already been as suspicious as it gets, as AIPAC, a front for “Israel”, has covered up the coronavirus cases there and who had contact with the infected attendees.

>The Jerusalem Post reported that the “Israeli” Science and Technology Minister Ofir Akunis said that “Israel” could have a coronavirus vaccine tested in a couple weeks and available in only 90 days.

>The Galilee Research Institute (MIGAL) has been working on a coronavirus vaccine BEFORE the coronavirus pandemic.

>Dr. Chen Katz MIGAL’s biotechnology group leader made an eye opening statement on this fact that they were developing a coronavirus vaccine BEFORE the pandemic. “Let’s call it pure luck,” he said. “We decided to choose coronavirus as a model for our system just as a proof of concept for our technology.

>Benjamin Netanyahu famously said that Israel’s relationship with China is a marriage made in heaven, “Israel” gives China control of major ports such as the one in Haifa. “Israel”-China keep getting closer on the field of technology, and when Trump talks about intellectual property theft by China, it is usually done through “Israel”.

“I would say that’s 50% of the battle. If I have someone who loses hope, I don’t care how many medications I give him, they’re going to go. So my goal is to avoid losing people to this coronavirus anyway we can,” Dr. Varon said.

Dr. Varon and his staff tape photographs of themselves on their hospital gowns. That allows patients to safely see the face behind the mask and perhaps feel a little less lonely and hopefully more connected.

I'm not doing this to be mean, just to clarify, but rather I'm hoping I can help stem some of the misinformation that's circulating.  The #1 evil about the Internet is how it makes you think bullsh\*t is true and truth is bullsh\*t. 

&#x200B;

1. Dr. Fauci is the one who predicted that the deaths may reach up to 240k.  If people are listening to him then let's chalk that up as a win because hurray someone is actually listening to a friggin SCIENTIST over Heir BurningOrangeFire President [https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/29/823517467/fauci-estimates-that-100-000-to-200-000-americans-could-die-from-the-coronavirus](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/29/823517467/fauci-estimates-that-100-000-to-200-000-americans-could-die-from-the-coronavirus) 
2. We do not yet know that we've reached the peak of the infection of COVID.  There are some indications that we may be flattening, at least in New York [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/andrew-cuomo-new-york-governor-flattening-curve/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/andrew-cuomo-new-york-governor-flattening-curve/) but we don't know yet whether these past couple of days are positive signs of just anomalies.  The virus has a week-ish latency period so it could be that it comes and goes in waves.  We simply don't have enough data to know.
3. There also may be a problem with reinfections, but we do not know if this is a big enough problem yet  [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-reinfection.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-reinfection.html).  If it is a problem, then that means it absolutely will come and go in waves.  It also means finding a working vaccine will be incredibly, incredibly difficult.  But because this virus is novel (meaning new and not well known), we don't know if these are anomalies and that the majority will be fine.  It could also be that they just re-test positive because they were never truly over the initial infection.  Bottom line: we just don't know.  
4. No one should be making assertions of fact about COVID outside of what limited information we have.  We just don't know that much about this virus.  What limited data we have you can find in the links above attached to the Roundtable post.  Outside of that everything else is purely speculative.  We are seeing N happening.  Doesn't mean it's not happening, but we don't know what it actually means.  Until we have enough time to study this virus and can gather enough data on its victims, we just cannot know anything for sure.  The best thing you can do is to follow the guidelines put out by the Surgeon General and (I know this is painful) those pushed by the Trump Administration.  If people are actually listening to these guidelines, then hopefully that'll make things better for us all.  If you're a praying person, pray for the people who are clinging to life and for their families.

She has a district-issued laptop, but no home Wi-Fi network any more. The cable company removed the router from her family’s Bronx apartment after they had trouble paying the monthly bill.

> For classes like statistics and neuroscience, Ms. Aluko has tried to complete assignments and participate in video conferences using her cellphone, but that is sometimes impossible.

> “I actually need my teachers, who know me and understand me, to help me, and I don’t have that,” she said. “I just keep thinking, ‘Oh, my God, I might not pass.’ I’m just really scared for the future.”

I would consider a “normal” person to be a person you would typically expect to find if you picked a random person out of the entire population. An average person if you will. 

And the average person is not 25 and perfectly healthy. The average person probably has some kind of pre existing condition of some kind. Maybe their overweight. Maybe they have high blood pressure. Maybe they have asthma. Maybe they have weak lungs or a weak heart due to some past disease they had. Maybe they have a genetic illness. Maybe they’re a smoker. Maybe they have a compromised immune system. The list goes on and on. The perfectly healthy young person is not “normal” at all but a rare thing. 

What’s more, you seem to be taking this attitude that as long as it doesn’t kill you, you don’t have to worry about it. About 20% of people have symptoms so severe they’re hospitalized. And there’s pretty strong evidence that even people who do survive in a large portion of cases [can suffer permanent lung damage](https://www.france24.com/en/20200402-for-some-survivors-coronavirus-complications-can-last-a-lifetime).

So it’s more akin to rolling a 6-sided die and if it lands on a 6 (17% chance) you’re hospitalized. And then you roll it again and if it’s 6 again (2.8% chance) you suffer permanent lung damage. Then you flip a coin and if it’s tails (1.4% chance) you die.

It still means you’re more likely than not to survive. But personally, I would rather not risk my life over the roll of two dice and a flip of a coin."

I know a family with a bunch of kids and seriously, year after year, they are sick the entire winter with colds and flus. This year was no different for them, except they’re convinced they definitely had the CV instead of just admitting they’re always sick with this type of shit every year lol

Having said that, I’m also slightly guilty. Husband and I got sick beginning of January, before CV was even on our minds, and at the time we were both like “what is this? It doesn’t seem like a cold, but it doesn’t seem like the flu either.” Symptoms consisted of dry cough and we skipped the whole sore throat we usually get at the beginnings of colds, but didn’t have those distinct flu symptoms we usually get like body aches. So of course we’ve entertained (mostly jokingly) the idea that maybe we had CV, but I’m DEFINITELY not counting on it. People forget there are all sorts of viruses that can cause similar symptoms, especially around winter time!"

Evers’ attorneys have stressed that there is no state case law upholding the governor’s emergency powers as superseding the state legislature, and the move would lead to an immediate court challenge from Republican lawmakers.

So when players & staff were getting private tests from private labs, they succumbed to public pressure because people thought they were taking tests from everyday people. Some owners literally made it a point to say they were not testing so they could get some PR points...even though behind the scenes they were trying to figure out ways to bring the season back ASAP.

Now they have made their roundabout way to what was known from the beginning. If you want the season back, the first step is to make sure no staff, player or even close people close to any player or staff has it. They don’t want the PR nightmare of the season being “postponed” twice due to a second outbreak. Every other league and/or sport event has canceled until the foreseeable future for a reason. All I have heard from the NBA side is dream scenarios for dates and messy decisions in regards to dealing with the coronavirus. 

And before anyone says it, I know the NBA lost ALOT of money this year. Between China & the coronavirus, they are deep in the red and need the playoffs to get back even. But to risk a potential second outbreak in the NBA is just extremely risky."

It is important to note that many schools across the state had moved online by 3/13, and many companies already had workers who were able to work from home doing so before statewide shelter in place orders came in. The governor had also closed nightclubs, bars, etc and urged vulnerable populations to stay home prior to the statewide shutdown.

Mayor De Blasio was urging a shelter in place order around the same time as CA was doing this. Article [dated 3/18 with Governor Cuomo](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ny-gov-cuomo-says-no-new-york-city-s-shelter-n1162911) being a dingus. [Two days later](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-20200320-hiya77j3w5brjbt7lbkrvcmeve-story.html) he declared shelter in place. To my understanding schools were not moved online until this 3/20 day, at least in NYC.

By the numbers.  
CA Population: 37M  
NY Population 20M

So, CA has roughly twice the number. How were cases looking, if we separate out a few weeks? All numbers are cumulative.

* Apache Junction Council Member Chip Wilson.

Nevertheless, a ventilator can be even worse than the virus it's treating. From The Spectator this week, written by a doctor called Matt Strauss:

> **Ventilators aren’t a panacea for a pandemic like coronavirus**

> 'More ventilators!’ cried the journalists on Twitter. 'Yes, more ventilators!' replied the politicians. ‘Where are the ventilators?’ demanded the journalists, now screaming on television. ‘Yes, even more!’ replied the government, somewhat nonsensically. 

> I am a critical care physician, specialising in the use of such machines. I’m flattered by all the attention our tools are receiving. But I fear the current clamour reminds me of nothing so much as the panic buyers of toilet-paper stampeding over each other in early March. When the history of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Western world is written, I do not believe 'massive ramp-up of ventilator manufacturing,' will be credited with our deliverance. Let me explain why.
Ventilators do not cure any disease. They can fill your lungs with air when you find yourself unable to do so yourself. They are associated with lung diseases in the public’s consciousness, but this is not in fact their most common or most appropriate application. 

> There are many reasons a person might not be able to fill their lungs with air. Undergoing a major abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia is perhaps chief among them. Other causes of coma, like drug intoxication or head trauma, also necessitate mechanical ventilation. While some neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or polio, leave a person awake, but too weak to work the bellows of the lung (the diaphragm.) In all of these cases, the ventilator pushes fresh air containing oxygen into healthy lungs which can transmit the oxygen to the bloodstream. 

> Conversely, when a person has a severe lung problem, you might imagine that some proportion of their lung tissue continues to receive air when they breath, but fails to transmit this oxygen to the bloodstream. To compensate for these malfunctioning bits of lung tissue, the person breathes harder and faster, as though they were running a marathon. 

> One can only run a marathon for so long before those same bellows of the lung fatigue, and eventually fail. My job is to identify those folks before their lungs stop working, and to put a plastic tube down their windpipe, hooking it up to a ventilator to do their breathing for them. This drastic step is generally predicated on the hope that I can do something to treat their lung problem and liberate them from their ventilator dependence within a few days. This might typically involve antibiotics for a bacterial pneumonia, or anti-inflammatories for asthma.

> Clinical trials of new and old medications are ongoing. But right now, I am sorry to say there is no proven treatment for Covid-19 infection. It is therefore at least conceivable that putting patients on ventilators for Covid-19 pneumonia could be a bridge to nowhere. 

> Now of course, hope springs eternal. The patient may recover on their own while we keep them alive with our machines. But this is not a risk-free wager. Dr. Paul Mayo, perhaps New York City’s most illustrious critical care doctor expressed the risks pithily: 'putting a person on a ventilator creates a disease known as being on a ventilator.'

> When we mechanically blow air into your damaged lungs faster and harder than humanly possible, ventilator-induced lung injury may result. Generally, for a person to tolerate the undertaking, we have to sedate them, leading to immobility and severe weakness. While sedated, the person cannot cough or clear their airway effectively, leading to superimposed bacterial pneumonia.

> This is an awful lot to survive. And in the case of Covid-19, the preliminary outcome data is rather dismal. On Monday, the New England Journal of Medicine published a case series of very ill Covid-19 patients in Seattle with data up to March 23: of the twenty patients who went on a ventilator, only four had so far escaped the hospital alive. Nine had died. Three remained in suspended animation, going on three or four weeks of ventilation. Four escaped the ventilator but remained in hospital. 

> Data from NHS intensive care units are broadly in line with the Seattle series. As of 27 March, of the UK’s ventilated Covid-19 patients who left ICU, only one-third were alive. Not reported is how many of those made it home. 

> There has never been a placebo randomised control trial of putting people on ventilators versus letting them struggle on. We therefore do not, strictly-speaking, know whether those who survive their time on ventilator may have survived anyway, or whether some would-be survivors died because they were committed to a ventilator.

> There will never be such a trial. Sometimes we feel that a person will definitely die immediately if a mechanical ventilator is not applied, and therefore nothing can possibly be lost in the attempt. But mission-creep affects us all. Every clear-eyed critical care doctor will admit that we sometimes ventilate people more out of wishful-thinking, desperation, or fear of lawsuit, than scientifically-based hope for recovery. 

> I spoke with Dr. Mayo because, as a New York City critical care doctor, he really is in the belly of the beast as far as this pandemic goes in the Anglosphere. (Also, as he is currently home sick with Covid-19, he had plenty of time to talk.) He described increasing pressure from hospital administrators, throughout the city, to put Covid-19 patients on ventilators earlier than would otherwise be recommended. The administrators believe that hooking Covid-19 patients up to a closed-circuit breathing apparatus (i.e. the ventilator) may decrease their infectivity to hospital staff. But does this mean we have the patient's best interests at heart in hooking them up to a ventilator?

> To put it simply, we do not know how many lives ventilators could or will save in the UK. It seems that at least two-thirds of attempts to stave off death with their use will fail in the short term. Of the remaining third, we do not know how many will be successful in the medium or long term. This doesn’t quite seem like a convincing rationale to shut down the British economy, redirect previous manufacturing output towards ventilators and suspend civil liberties to give us more time for the attempt. And those bemoaning the government's failure to demand more and more ventilators should pause for a moment and ask themselves whether that is really the right solution.

At the end of this period, the treatment group showed 13/15 negative for viral RNA via throat swab. . .and the control group showed 14/15 negative. Other parameters were also so similar between the treatment and control groups as to be uninterpretable. So those numbers are unfortunately not too useful. It’s tempting to run with a “hydroxychloroquine fails” take, but we can’t even say that with such a strong control group response. It’s basically a blown trial that can’t tell us anything – we have no idea what an earlier endpoint would have told us, for example, although I have to note that this is about the time course of treatment in the widely-discussed Marseille study.

“It’s going to be very tough but we have the capacity,” the mayor said at a news conference at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

“If we need to do temporary burials to be able to tide us over to pass the crisis, and then work with each family on their appropriate arrangements, we have the ability to do that,” he said, adding, “We may well be dealing with temporary burials so we can deal with each family later.”""

Let's look at the projected models and current data to judge our success.

The [IMHE models](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections), the official ones being used by the US and developed by the University of Washington predicted close to 100,000 deaths by August and now they are predicting 81,000 instead largely thanks to people staying at home.

[Looking at available data](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?utm_campaign=homeAdvegas1?), the United States  is a lot closer in deaths per million to Germany (31 v 19 per 1 million) than they are to most of our European counterparts like Spain (282) Italy (273) France (137) Sweden (205) or the Netherlands (109).

So why are we closer to Germany? Probably because the countries that have performed the most tests in the world are Germany (920,000 tests) and the US (1,850,000 tests).

Honestly, it sounds crazy, but this is going pretty well for what it is.

It's a possibility but CV19's cousin SARS disappeared and hasn't returned. MERS has become a sporadic and relatively minor nuisance that pops up from time to time. H1N1 is still circulating but doesn't have significant impacts. Historically, a second wave as serious as the first is possible - but not likely.

* In the Northern Hemisphere seasonality should be a significant factor. Most viruses fall off substantially or die out in warmer months.

* Increasing 'herd immunity'. The vast majority of people who get CV19 either remain [asymptomatic or have mild cold/flu symptoms](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) they get over at home with no treatment. They then have immunity, probably [for a couple years at least](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/fort5p/almost_two_thirds_of_critically_ill_coronavirus/fli8r5n/), [maybe longer.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2008/08/researchers-find-long-lived-immunity-1918-pandemic-virus) They no longer get it or spread it.

* The most susceptible people get it first so an increasing proportion of the remaining population are those who are more resistant to getting it at all. We don't know how many people are already naturally completely immune or highly resistant to getting CV19.

* Coronaviridae tend to mutate in ways that reduce their infectiousness and severity. It happened with SARS and with MERS and [there are already signs it's happening with CV19.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/foz6s7/reinfection_could_not_occur_in_sarscov2_infected/flic9m0/)

* Hopefully, in a month or so we'll have DIY five-minute at-home tests which will enable greatly reduced transmission as well as contact tracing and prevention. There are also phone apps being worked on that will assist with contact tracing.

* In a few weeks we'll have serological tests that will tell us who's already had CV19 and is immune (many people already had it and didn't even know).

* Hospitals and medical offices are initially strong infection points early in an outbreak. Now we understand what we're facing and no longer have CV19 infected people queuing up with non-infected people at doctor offices, pharmacies, urgent cares, HMOs and hospitals. As shutdowns end, many of those precautions will remain in place."

Absolutely hated online school. I never ate, I either slept too much or too little, barely got work done and fell behind, then I became depressed and couldn't do things that made me happy like reading and play video games. I decided to go back to public school cause it's a better learning environment for me. After a lot of mix ups and having to recover credits, I got into a great high school the beginning of this semester. I was loving it- got great grades, never tardy, had friends in my classes- I was starting to have a social life too! And my depression was gone!

Coronavirus changed all that. If I had known, I wouldn't have bothered making the switch.

Just because the numbers are new positive cases does not necessarily mean the infections are new. 

First, there was a huge backlog of tests that needed to get processed, at one point 59,500 tests were waiting to be processed. The State made a huge push to get that number down, which they [did](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/coronavirus/california-covid-19-testing-backlog-cut-by-two-thirds-2/2267333/). So that right there can account for some of the new positive cases.

Second, it might be possible for someone to get infected, have a long incubation period before showing symptoms and then have the virus for a while before getting sick enough to go to the hospital and get a test. Especially considering how hard it was(still is?) to get a test. 

Third, there is still absolutely going to be some community transmission. A large percentage of people with Covid-19 are asymptomatic. Without robust testing, even with shelter in place those people will be going to the grocery store and doing other essential business. They could even be an essential worker. So there are going to be some new cases. 

So to answer your question, yes, there will be people doing everything ""correctly"" and still getting community spread. The only way to get that close to zero is to test every one or close to everyone like South Korea is doing. Unfortunately, California and the U.S. does not have the medical infrastructure to do that. 

I'm trying not to be paranoid though. Just stay informed and take reasonable precautions. We'll get through this together."

As of Monday afternoon, there are more than 350 cases, with at least 14 deaths.

The nation is working around the clock to make sure it’s residents are safe.

""One death is one way too many,"" Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said.

Since last month, President Nez and his administration has worked to keep their people safe through a shelter in place and a strict daily curfew.

The Navajo Nation is working closely with the Arizona National Guard, FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers among other state and federal agencies to bring in proper health supplies, and work on getting additional health care facilities setup.

""We're in the early stages right now,"" President Nez said.""We have to begin to have those types of discussions and FEMA in that team there is helping with Gallup Indian Medical center, Chinle Comprehensive Healthcare Facility....those are the communities that see a big rise in emergency room visits.""

Inside of the Chinle basketball arena, a PPE distribution center is setup for supplies going to hospitals on the Navajo Nation.

On top of getting those emergency supplies distributed and facilities in place, there is an ongoing strict curfew on the Navajo Nation from 8:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m.

That curfew will be even more strict in the upcoming days.

""This Friday, Friday 8pm to the next following Monday at 5am is going to be a total curfew,” President Nez said. “Everybody should have their supplies. Now it’s time to really focus on hunkering down and slowing down the spread of coronavirus.""

The ongoing, and upcoming 57-hour curfew means people need to stay home, unless there is an emergency. The weekend curfew impacts everyone on Navajo Nation unless they are essential employees. If they are essential, they are required to show proof of official identification or letter from their employers on official letterhead.

Looking to this weekend’s curfew, there will be additional checkpoints to enforce the “Stay at Home Order”. If people don’t follow the order or curfew, they will get a citation and a fine by Navajo Nation Police.

“The weekend curfew helps to combat the virus,” Vice President Myron Lizer said in a press release. “We need to take it upon ourselves to protect our families…”

1. What's the immunity period: while it is not known exactly how long you are immune after contracting coronavirus, there is almost certainly some period of immunity for someone who contracted it. Could be anywhere from a few months to lifetime protection (unlikely).

2. What are our *actual* infection numbers. If 4000 people in Ottawa actually test positive, what's the true number (including asymptomatic)? 20k? 100k?

3. Weather: many viruses have a much, much more difficult time spreading in hot, humid summer weather. It is not known if this is the case one way or the other yet.

If all 3 are worst case scenario (low immunity period, low actual infection and no weather relief) then yes we could be back to square one.

Otherwise, what could happen is smaller outbreaks which don't quite hit current levels, and may even merit some minor relief from the current restrictions.

Remember - the idea is to flatten the curve, which is not to even reduce the total number of people infected, just to delay it so that it is more of an even flow of cases rather than a huge spike and drop-off.

I don't think it's going to be back to complete normal in the next year, but by July small gatherings may be acceptable."

There is also evidence that the reported death toll in the United States is too low. Some public health experts say that official counts have failed to capture the true number of Americans dying in this pandemic. The first reported death from COVID-19 in the country was announced on Feb. 29 in Washington state, but doctors in rural areas [told the New York Times](https://www.yahoo.com/news/official-counts-understate-u-coronavirus-120914155.html) that some deaths before that were “likely misidentified as influenza or only described as pneumonia.”

The bat origins aren’t based on an anecdote that someone ate a bat and got sick. It is based on the structure of the virus and the fact that families of similar viruses have been sampled and anlysed with bats. 

If you want to picture an origin story: an apparently healthy horseshoe bat harboring this virus is eating a bananna. It flies over a marketplace full of exotic animals and drops the bannana. The bananna with virus laden saliva is swallowed by a little scaly animal whose scales often get ground up into traditional medicines.  The little pangolin happens to be susceptable to this virus, and happens to be sick with its own virus. These combine in the pangolin and happen to form a deadly combination which can spread to and among humans. A human drinks several beverages of this pangolin scale medicine and begins to shed the virus themselves at an accelerating rate. Maybe this person never feels sick. Maybe they die at home in their bed and it looks like pnemonia. Two weeks later, dozens of people in Wuhan start to show up at the hospital with breathing problems. They’ve all been to the local marketplace. 

This story is fiction, and I got the bannana bat picture from the movie Contagion which was suprisingly well done.

[Article discussing the forensic analysis of Covid-19 RNA](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-not-human-made-lab-genetic-analysis-nature)

Edit: also they do sell bats for consumption at the wet market in Wuhan, but in this case the structure of the virus has a feature found in pangolins, which were also for sale. The pangolin feature allowed it to jump to humans."

I haven't seen any uptick in hospitalization or any overwhelming of medical centers yet in Sweden -- have you heard of anything on your end?  I am really hoping that Sweden will conquer this without the need to shut down non-essential stuff, and be a good example for the rest of the world in terms of fighting this virus.  Very much rooting for you guys!  

This Swiss doctor's website published updates everyday, and he is very against the strict lockdown measures implemented across the globe from a scientific/viral perspective.  He certainly provides a different way of looking at the virus versus the panic of the virus.  I am sure some of his updates have bias, as he does seem to be very anti-government, but a lot of the information he posts is factual and science-based, which I enjoy.

Pneumonia is a common occurrence in hospitals precisely because people are lying on their backs for prolonged periods of time, breathe shallowly as a result and often have a compromised immune system. In hospitals in our country they have these kinds of toys that you’re supposed to breathe into as strong as possible to help prevent pneumonia by properly airing the lungs. 

Pneumonia is also the key complication of coronavirus that leads to death. That’s why they’ve been putting people on their stomachs in hospitals when they treat coronavirus complications. 

So this doctor‘s advice to learn a breathing technique that helps to really air your lungs and lie on your stomach makes perfect sense. 

Also, I think as asthmatics, it’s always good to learn a few breathing techniques that might help you in certain situations. My doc has shown me a few things that have really helped me over time."

Coronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Herein, we show that the ribonucleoside analog β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to the nucleoside analog inhibitor remdesivir. In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5′-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis in CoV. The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against multiple coronaviruses and oral bioavailability highlight its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other future zoonotic coronaviruses."

- India reducing supply of treatments

- China nationalising US factories


I can’t find any proof of the formermost, and scant in the way of the latter two. It’s important to note that reducing exports is not the same as _stealing purchases_, and that as I’ve implied in other comments, China’s surreptitious economic activities aren’t good either.

I think it's common sense that anything that causes massive strain on the body is going to make your outcome worse, obesity included.

>Sen. Bernie Sanders’s lengthy deliberations about the future of his presidential campaign have exposed divisions in his movement between die-hard liberal activists with little appetite to fall in line behind former vice president Joe Biden and more conventional Democrats who see some merit in Sanders (I-Vt.) withdrawing from the race.

>After revelations that some top aides and allies have urged the senator to consider ending his campaign, some Sanders supporters voiced alarm about the people surrounding him and have even called for their ouster.

>The Washington Post reported Saturday that the group lobbying him to consider withdrawing included campaign manager Faiz Shakir and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a top Sanders surrogate and ally, according to the two people with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive private discussions.

>“They shouldn’t be part of the campaign,” said RoseAnn DeMoro in an interview Monday, speaking of anyone encouraging him to consider bowing out. A longtime friend of Sanders and a former head of a national nurses’ union, DeMoro added, “If people want to go work on K Street right now, go. The base is attached to the movement and Bernie, not operatives.”

>Sanders, who has fallen far behind Biden in the chase for delegates to the summer nominating convention with almost no realistic path to catching him, has not declared his intentions beyond saying he is assessing his path forward.

>He has been sounding out many top supporters in recent weeks. Shortly before she participated in a virtual roundtable with Sanders on March 22, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) advised him in a telephone call to remain in the contest, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation.

>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has campaigned for Sanders, has talked openly about the need for Democrats to unite behind a possible Biden nomination. After Sanders’s losses on Super Tuesday, she said that the election was “more important than all of us.”

>Still, her team and the Sanders camp remain in contact — Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign manager Rebecca Rodriguez spoke to Shakir on Sunday, according to a spokesperson.

>The uncertainty has created some tension in the universe of Sanders supporters, which includes legions of everyday people who have donated to his campaign, lawmakers who have endorsed him and activists and advisers he has consulted.

>“If I was told who the nominee was going to be, but I didn’t get to vote, I would feel disenfranchised,” said Randy Bryce, a Sanders state co-chair and former congressional candidate who wants him to keep running at least through the last primaries in June. “People will feel like they’re not going to matter in one of those later states if there’s not a primary.”

>Bryce’s home state of Wisconsin was set on Tuesday to be the first state in three weeks to hold a primary. But it was cast into doubt Monday when Gov. Tony Evers (D) suspended in-person voting; later in the day the state Supreme Court overturned his action after a legal challenge from the state’s GOP legislative leaders.

>Some close Sanders allies had said the outcome in Wisconsin could offer more clarity about the senator’s future. They predicted that a landslide loss, as recent polling has predicted, might persuade him to end his bid. Evers’s executive order would have extended the mail-in voting deadline to June 9.

>On Monday, Our Revolution, a nonprofit aligned with Sanders, sent an email to supporters with the subject line “Tell Bernie if you’ll have his back if he stays in the presidential race.”

>“If Bernie remains in the race, he will undoubtedly be over the 25% threshold necessary to get enough members on the Rules and Platform Committees who can fight for our vision of a progressive party,” said the email, which was signed by Larry Cohen, board chairman of Our Revolution.

>The rules changes that Sanders allies fought for after the 2016 race, including one that prevents automatic “superdelegates” from voting on the first ballot of the convention, would expire unless agreed to by the key committees this year.

>“Things like that would be at risk if the senator doesn’t hit 15 percent in the remaining primaries,” said Paco Fabian, a spokesman for Our Revolution. “We have very little confidence, if not zero, that the rules implemented last time would remain in place. We need to make sure they’re made permanent.”

>Beyond Shakir and Jayapal, longtime strategist Jeff Weaver has privately made a case that exiting the race more quickly and on good terms with Biden would give Sanders added leverage in the long run, according to one of the people who described the discussions; the other said Weaver has used a light touch in presenting his case.

>Early Sunday morning, after The Post reported those internal deliberations, “People for Bernie,” a group of pro-Sanders activists, tweeted, “Bernie Sanders should not drop out. Pass it on.”

>Those close to Sanders say he is focused heavily on the coronavirus crisis and they are not certain what he will decide. Over the past few weeks, he has used his campaign as a vehicle to champion the liberal ideas he believes the government should adopt to combat the crisis, such as universal health care coverage.

>Gone are the raucous rallies that have been deemed unsafe during the spread of the virus. Instead, he has hosted events with experts, musical guests and political allies, streamed live on the Internet.

>Sanders has ceased his direct attacks on Biden, even as some allies, including DeMoro and Bryce, have not. The senator said recently that he would like to debate Biden again, while Biden has argued that there have been enough debates. A Democratic National Committee spokeswoman said Monday that she had no new updates on whether there would be another primary debate.

>The two men talked recently when Biden called Sanders to inform him, as a courtesy, that he would soon be beginning the process to pick a running mate.

>With the Senate out of session and much of the country hunkering down, Sanders has been at home in Vermont. A pair of aides — one who handles logistics and another responsible for video live streams — have been with him, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, but senior staff are working from their homes.

>On Sunday, at least one staffer was making a public push for a prolonged primary fight.

>“Four out of five of the largest Black populations in the country haven’t voted. And some of you want to call off the primary. Your interest in the franchise is self interest, and it shows,” tweeted Briahna Joy Gray, national press secretary for the Sanders campaign."

The video from **Korea Times** is very informative and uses easy to understand and concise words to make it more understandable.


Lessons learned from Dr. Djaballah about the COVID-19, caused by the SAR-CoV2 virus, can be summed up in several notes. Check out the video interview with Dr. Djaballah for more in depth.


**How much do we know about this virus?**

I'll also add details from [Vox's Comparison of Flu and Covid-19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVIGhz3uwuQ)

* Coronavirus is everywhere. It stays mostly with animals and has mutated / crossed to humans 3 times (SARS-CoV-1, MERS, SARS-CoV-2).

* It is called ""cryptic and mysterious"" as it does not follow the usual rules we know about viruses. Reason below: 

* SARS-CoV-2 is unusual from other coronaviruses as it is much **more aggressive and more lethal**.

* There are infected people who tested negative later and are released, but who gets **""reinfected""**. This is most probably they are actually infected but the  the tests we used may not be sensitive enough to detect the virus (**There is a certain limit to what the test can detect and if the infection is below the threshold, it will not be detected**).

* It seems to attack not only the lungs but also possibly the heart and liver.

* It attacks mainly the **elderly** (lower immune systems) and people between adolescence and old age (perhaps 20-60 y/o) with **certain lifestyles and underlying conditions.**

* There is **lower infection of the young** than that of MERS.

* This virus is friends with bacteria, and bacteria love **confined spaces and can stay in both hard and soft surfaces** (hello airplanes)

* This virus **mutates faster** (ex. the virus that left China on the plane, landed as a more aggressive mutation in Italy).

* The virus almost behaves like a bacteria (non-hospital acquired bacterial infection)

* **VOX for the rest of the items under this section**: Incubation period for Covid-19 is longer than flu, a person may not even show symptoms and become sick until after 5 days to 14 days from day of acquiring the virus. And that 5 to 14 day incubation period between getting infected and getting sick is considered contagious.

* Contagiousness  / Basic Reproduction Number of Covid-19 is almost twice as high than flu, 20% of the world's population can get infected.

* Hospitalization rate is 20-30% compered to 2% for flu.

* Fatality rate of 1-3% compared to 0.1% for flu

* No one is immune to Covid-19 (unless those who got it and recovered completely)


**Where far are we from developing a vaccine?**

* We still do not a vaccine for SARS-CoV-1 years after the outbreak.

* Even if we have a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 right not, it will not help much as a **vaccine is a preventive thing**, not a cure. It just helps the immune system get a kickstart of kicking out the viruses / sickness.


**Who holds the key to understanding the nature of COVID-19?**

* China is not as forthcoming with the details for the vaccine, as we do not have enough information about China's **Patient Zero** - the key to learning how the virus works, as we can discover how the virus mutated and enabled animal to human transmission


**Why don't we have a vaccine for SARS-CoV1 yet?** (Yes it's Cov-1 as the person is saying, we don't even have vaccine for Cov-1 years after, what can we expect now for Cov-2?)

* There was no more threat of SARS-CoV-1 and people's demand lowered. Example, EBOLA vaccine was created only after it left Africa and infected people in Europe and America.

* They tried and had difficulties so it needs more years of research.

* Crisis, government funding and pressure to private enterprises are necessary to push for vaccine creation.


**The debate: Mask or no mask?**

* **Yes to mask**. Less chance of touching your face esp the the mouth and nose.

* Protecting yourself as well as protecting other people from you.

**Can we stop the spread? How?**


* Personal hygiene - as the virus almost act like a bacteria

* Disinfection

**Lessons to learn from the COVID-19 outbreak**

* **Preparedness** - if there is a patient (Patient Zero) that exhibits unfamiliar sets of signs and symptoms, file a report across all healthcare institutions

* **Monitoring** of both people and livestock, and borders if there is news of infection spread from other places (because this is where we will mostly likely get unknown diseases)"

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-29/scott-morrison-coronavirus-covid19-two-person-rule-explained/12101212


What are the new rules?
For the last week, the Government has strongly encouraged people to stay home but has technically made exceptions for gatherings, indoor and outdoor, of up to 10 people.


Sunday night's announcement cuts that number to two, significantly tightening the wriggle room for leaving one's house.


This applies for indoor gatherings as well as outdoor, and includes private properties too.


While Mr Morrison did not make this clear initially, the ABC has sought clarification and been told the restrictions apply to all indoor settings — so you can not have more than one friend over to your house.

Which states are enforcing the new rule?
In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews said people will face an on-spot-fine of more than $1,600 if you breach the two-person rule."

Then it becomes a sort of tribalism. ""We are the ones who were right and all of you other people are idiots"". It's the same way some Americans are blaming China for this or even blaming NY for this.

Reddit supports circle-jerk style tribalism like this via the upvote/downvote system. Newcomers see the upvoted comments and posts more often and become (at least somewhat) indoctrinated that way.

Even outside of coronavirus, look at something like a video game subreddit when some questionable changes have been made to the game (usually around monetization). The whole subreddit only talks about that for weeks or even months!

I never would have thought it was that bad. He almost quit touring entirely because he just couldn't handle it. The medication seems like it really unlocked his mind and he's treating the idea of making music so much differently now.

Also him calling himself the ""Michael Cera of the electronic music world"" is so fitting lmaoooo

He might be nearing the final stages of his album within the next month or so but idk how coronavirus is going to affect his release dates assuming they want to do some visual stuff for this project as well. 

Based off what he said in terms of his music though it seems like he might end up veering off the experimental stuff or he may attempt to make it more accessible for this album. He said he actually wants people to casually listen to his music like at a ""dinner party"" and people can't really do that right now because it's just so complex. Very interested to see his musical direction from this point on."

There is no evidence of babies being infected in-utero, and other similar virus’s do not infect babies in the womb (flu, SARS, etc), so it is decently safe to conclude it is highly likely COVID behaves the same. Especially coupled with the fact that we have zero cases where that has happened thus far. 

This is extremely, extremely sad. And yes, COVID is to blame, but I really wish news sources would be more responsible with these titles.

“We will see many more cases over the next few weeks,” the county’s public health director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said. “If you have enough supplies in your home, this will be the week to skip shopping altogether.”

Officials urged residents to practice social distancing and adhere to stay-at-home orders.

“We’re worried, that without everyone taking every possible precaution, our numbers could start skyrocketing, that’s one thing we don’t want to see happen,” Ferrer said. “It really is time for those people who may not have taken this seriously before, to understand the seriousness of what’s going on in our communities, the seriousness of living through a pandemic.”"

I'd love to run on a treadmill at home, but that'd mean death by downstairs neighbor rather than death by coronavirus. We don't know a lot about the virus, but we do know that it's particularly brutal to the old, but also to the overweight.  It's hard to blame people for wanting to work on their fitness when it could literally be a life or death matter.  

There's nothing wrong with running outside as long as you stay away from people.  That's hard to do in a city as densely packed as we are here though, so I personally only run when it's late out and others aren't around.  I don't want to blow up my spot, but there are places in the city where you can run as many laps as you want without seeing a soul.  It's not the most interesting run in the world (definitely not as pretty as running along the waterfront), but it gets the job done."

China, the OG gangster of coronavirus is 7 months into this tragedy.  When they were just about to re-open movie theaters they cancelled that plan do to fears of a second coming. We are the new epicenter of this crisis. While our numbers are not controlled by the communist party they are controlled by a Russian powered oligarch and are probably just as inaccurate.  Our recovery will probably be just as long, if not longer.

We didn't recognize a problem until early March. Even with Scientific advances and wishfull thinking, we are probably looking at September until things start to wind down. If we are being realistic, the 2021 season is where is is going to be.

Not because it's impossible, it's because it would cost a lot and it's not worth it. Under normal conditions producing a vaccine takes a decade and costs a billion. It's a commercial endeavour, and as such the company attempting it needs to be reasonably sure it's worth the investment.

MERS/SARS have been contained. A vaccine for the common cold would be nice, but would people buy it? Most people don't take the flu vaccine, which can actually kill you if it catches you on the wrong foot, and makes you feel miserable at best. Wanna bet people would buy a cold vaccine, especially if told it's only something like 60% effective? I mean, given another decade you can maybe work it into mandatory vaccination programs given and payed for by government money, but not all countries do that."

I’ve seen a few articles from some researchers saying that it might shave months off of testing (given that normal Phase 3 trials involve a vaccinated and placebo group and seeing who gets infected in their daily lives). Also saw an article (WSJ maybe?) that stated that by March 14 researchers had a drug which produced an antibody response in mice genetically engineered to have an immune system similar to humans. At that point, if we have confirmation that it does the same in humans (obtained by dosing with the drug and then directly exposing subjects to coronavirus and not seeing infection) ... we essentially have a vaccine, no?

I’m in the age group with <1% hospitalization in COVID cases, no pre-existing conditions and in good health, and I know I would be willing to be vaccinated and exposed to COVID in a trial if it meant shaving months off of the development time. Can’t imagine I’m the only one."

Strong-armed Florida International quarterback James Morgan isn't a secret in NFL scouting circles.

Since an impressive NFL scouting combine, Morgan has been rising steadily on draft boards.

An NFL area scout based in the Southeast said that Morgan has one of the three strongest arms in the draft and praised him for his intelligence and leadership.

Several NFL teams are closely vetting Morgan, who can't go on visits or work out privately due to the restrictions put in place during the coronavirus pandemic.

Among the teams doing extra homework on Morgan, according to NFL sources not authorized to speak publicly: his hometown Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, Chicago Bears, Indianapolis Colts, Las Vegas Raiders, New York Giants, Buffalo Bills, New York Jets and Miami Dolphins.

Morgan met with the Texans at the East-West Shrine all-star game.

Morgan has drawn comparisons from scouts to NFL quarterbacks Kirk Cousins and Joe Flacco.

Named the Conference USA Newcomer of the Year in 2018, the 6-4, 229-pounder with 4.89 speed in the 40-yard dash completed 65.3 percent of his throws for 2,727 yards and a school-record 26 touchdowns with seven interceptions as a junior.

Last season, he completed 58 percent of his throws for 2,583 yards, 14 touchdowns and five interceptions in a dozen starts while playing through a knee injury and dealing with a lot of dropped passes. Morgan is healthy now.

A Green Bay, Wis., native who wore Brett Favre's No. 4 jersey in high school, Morgan transferred to FIU after starting at Bowling Green."

If you can find a quiet space on a beach in your local area away from other people, I don't believe morally you're doing anything wrong. BUT, you need to be prepared to turn around and go home if the beach is crowded. Also, I don't think it's right to drive a long way from the area where you live. I'm also not sure if you should eat your dinner somewhere where you can't give your hands a proper wash with soap and water beforehand.

Funnily enough, it's the part of your trip that's currently OKAY by government regulations that's the most risky - going into a chip shop and interacting with the staff.

Personally, I try and find time to go and sit in the park next to my home every day, which is very calming for me and has a positive effect on my mental health. I live in an apartment and otherwise wouldn't get quiet time outside. This is against current government recommendations - but, it would be fine under those regulations for me to go to Ikea and wander around.

It's worth noting that if people aren't able to follow the spirit of the rules (don't do stuff that spreads coronavirus by staying away from people) we will get harsher restrictions."

Also this move can only be sustained if they leave the euro and regain the ability to print their own currency. Whether wise or not, it functionally can't happen without either an already existing deep surplus of euros to tap into, or breaking free from the currency controls that limits the number of euros in circulation to what Frankfurt approves. But there is no surplus, because economic activity has ground to a halt which has strangled VAT and other taxes, and the country was already in deep debt anyway."

Only she isn't.

I saw her doing it on an Elderly Parent thread a while ago, acting like she knew everything about Deprivation of Liberty Safeguarding and how restricting visits affects elderly relatives in care homes. She was trying to gee up some clearly distressed posters into complaining to care home management and citing  that restricting visits was going against the DOLS guidelines and therefore was illegal. She threw in various essay style references to court cases to make herself look clever.   Who's going to look them up? 

One poster who clearly understood the intricacies of DOLS tried to correct her, that it wasn't a DOLS issue because visiting restrictions were for the greater good and not specific to one person. She was like a dog with a bone. Throwing citations around and asserting herself as the font of all knowledge.  

I closed the thread after that, she was winding me up. I know, through work, what DOLS is and how it's applied. My knowledge is very much on the surface but I could tell she probably had the same level of knowledge as me but was trying to come across as clued up. 

When I read the comment she's posted today it was written in the exact same style and tone.

Even the mainstream media is starting to ask questions about their biotech facility a few blocks away from the wet-market where the disease came from. I learned about their biotech facilities months ago when I first heard about the virus. I learned about Wuhan on Wikipedia. 

Wuhan is extremely populated and the main central hub of transportation through the rest of China so It would have been the absolute perfect place to “accidentally” release a virus.

Wuhan is home to the largest Biotech facilities in China and scientists (I believe The Hill wrote an article on this a while ago) were testing coronavirus on bats and other animals. Some of the scientists claimed they were urinated on and bit by the bats. The virus could have been an accident but if it was on purpose then China has plenty of excuses.

The world economy has basically crashed so China is pretty happy about that and of course nobody is paying attention to the human rights violations.

The part that really pisses me off is the Chinese Government already re-opened the wet market where the disease was first reported in Wuhan and they are obviously lying about having no new cases and were lying about the virus when it started too thus making the world have kind of a delayed reaction.

I hope every single member of this mafia dies horribly.   


Yesterday evening, they lost a vote for absentee ballot in the coming election. 

They reattempted the vote proposing a similar and stricter bill. The bill was signed by two absent PiS MPs. One MP voted for an absent MP, which is a clear violation of the sejm discipline (this has happened previously with a different PiS-aligned MP on PiS's previous term). Three opposition MPs claim the new remote voting app used the same (notoriously shitty piece of software) counted their votes incorrectly.   


PiS won the second vote. The bill sets the new date of the election to May 17th, a week late. The bill has many fun little parts, like up to three years in prison for hiding, destroying or modifying the ballot papers. This is a clear violation of the constitution, but PiS doesn't care, since the Constitutional Tribunal is effectively dismantled.   


The ballot papers are going to be delivered by the Polish Post, a state owned postal service. PiS has replaced the CEO of Polish Post with a party member last week.   


Seriously, fuck PiS. They are using the coronavirus epidemic and the fact that people are not even allowed to protest to pass the most insidious pieces of legislature imagined. All of this because the little fucker Kaczyński really wants his little toadie to remain president.

>For example, if someone with COVID-19 is hit by a truck and dies from blood loss, they would be counted in that statistic, despite COVID-19 being completely irrelevant to the cause of their death, because of their infected status.

no they would not as there is no reason to test them for the virus.

>This is the way that the UK, Germany, Italy, and the US record COVID-19 deaths for public reporting, some of them use the same statistics in other areas as well. And this can be very misleading, we have no idea how many of these deaths are actually because of COVID-19! Partly this is because doctors don't know either; they can make a best guess, but in many cases that won't be absolutely certain.

On the other hand people dying outside of hospitals (old peoples homes, etc.) are not being tested for covid-19, so their statistics are not being added to the public numbers. At the moment it is impossible to accurately determine the number of death  due to covid-19. Imo, it will be at least 12 months, probably more, before we know the true death toll.

>There are papers out there by reputable institutions that are attempting to predict how many of the deaths are ""above expected"". 

source them.

> There are papers out there by reputable institutions that are attempting to predict how many of the deaths are ""above expected"". For example, it is known that ~4% of people age 70-80 will die in any given year from all causes. What's uncertain sofar is whether the number of deaths will, over the course of the year, be significantly higher than what would be expected without the virus. Current COVID-19 stats give a death rate of ~8% for the same age group, but this doesn't take into account the large amount of cases that go completely undiagnosed. It is entirely possible, according to many of these studies, that the number of deaths reported will not be significantly higher than expected for the same time frame but this will only be known for certain after the pandemic is over.

[higher death rates in italy:](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-italy/italy-coronavirus-death-rate-slows-but-studies-suggest-true-tally-higher-idUKKBN21J68C)
> Separate data from national statistics office ISTAT showed deaths in the north of Italy doubled in the first three weeks of March compared with the average during the same period between 2015 and 2019, reflecting the onset of coronavirus.

Sourced.
 
>But take a few grains of salt when looking at the statistics you see on the TV - they're trying to cash in on the pandemic by selling headlines just as much as ever before.

Stop it. Stop downplaying this. The current situation is unlike anything the world has seen since the second world war. 75 years. Stop saying this is a media driven panic. This is real. Many people will die. People you know will die."

Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS (; listen ; 22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: ""He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered"".

## California Gov. Newsom launches ‘phase one’ of coronavirus response, seeks 50,000 hospital beds

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will launch “phase one” of its emergency coronavirus response and will seek an additional 50,000 hospital beds on top of the 75,000 beds currently in the state’s hospital system.

Newsom said he’s asked the state’s hospitals to surge their capacity by roughly 40%, which he predicts will create an additional 30,000 beds across the state.

I do the converting to per million my self.

I take the total cases, tests, deaths, then compare it to country / province population, and find a percentage, then take that percentage and convert it into per 1 million ratio. These numbers are from yesterday.

For example, to double check you can take my 1027 cases per 1 million in USA and times it by their population (327 million) you get (1027x327 =335,829 cases total) that was the number of cases USA had at some time of day yesterday.

2020-04-06,Hafomeng,Coronavirus,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwb52f/mainland_china_reports_32_new_confirmed_cases_of/fmnbupj/,"There is no evidence at all for the claim that China's numbers are purposely underestimated by a factor of 10-40x. We do know that the Chinese data is incomplete, because some who had the disease recovered at home without being tested, and during the peak of their epidemic some died without being tested due to lack of resources. 

That said, there are a number of indicators that suggest that the Chinese numbers are not that far off: 

**Imported Case Analysis:** 

* South Korea: The South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare publishes their breakdown of exported cases daily. [Here are the numbers for April 1st 2020](https://i.imgur.com/uOgdilY.png). As of that date, South Korea had detected 17 cases from China, but detected 198 cases imported from America and 316 cases from Europe. 

* Singapore: The Ministry of Health of Singapore detected [24 cases of COVID-19 originating from China between January 22nd and February 4th](https://i.imgur.com/byNWGmp.png). As of March 20th, Singapore had detected more cases from the United States and Britain than China. 

* Taiwan: According to the Taiwanese Center's for Disease Control, Taiwan detected 13 cases of COVID-19 imported from China between January 23rd and February 6th. Recent imported cases are nearly exclusively of North American and European origin. 


The fact that South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan all detected relatively few imported cases from China in January-February strongly suggests that the outbreak was not out of control during that time. If China was deliberately understating the extent of the epidemic 10-40x, this would be clearly reflected in large numbers of exported cases to these three locations given the high volume of air traffic. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Evacuee Analysis:**

* Taiwan: On February 3rd, Taiwan evacuated [247 people from Wuhan. Only one evacuee tested positive.](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/t6Fse1p3HY-GelJzlRcvHQ?typeid=158) 

* Singapore: February 9th, [Singapore evacuated 174 people, with two individuals eventually testing positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuations_related_to_the_2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic#cite_note-105). 

* United States: On January 29th, the United States evacuated [195 Americans from Wuhan. Zero tested positive for the virus](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/10/us/coronavirus-american-evacuees-release/index.html).  On February 4th, the United States again [evacuated 350 more Americans from Wuhan, and one tested positive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200216075616/https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/first-coronavirus-case-confirmed-in-san-diego-county/2261207/).

* Germany: On January 31st, [Germany evacuated 124 people from Wuhan, with only 2 testing positive](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-german-evacuation-flight-from-china-carried-two-infected-people/a-52229955). 

* Australia: February 3rd, [Australia evacuated 243 people from Wuhan. No positives](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/16/first-group-of-australian-evacuees-set-to-leave-christmas-island-with-no-reported-cases-of-coronavirus). 

* In fact, [not a single evacuation flight from Wuhan suggests extremely widespread community spread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuations_related_to_the_2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), with all reporting between 0%-2.5% infected.


Similarly, the evacuee analysis cuts completely against the idea that China was grossly under reporting the extent of spread in Wuhan. We know from countries like Germany and South Korea who test extensively that the true CFR for COVID-19 is likely somewhere between 1-2%. For 45,000 people to die, that would require between 2.25-4.5 million infections in Wuhan. That's between 33-66% of the 6m Wuhan residents who remained after [5 million people left Wuhan for Lunar New Years](https://www.businessinsider.com/5-million-left-wuhan-before-coronavirus-quarantine-2020-1). Infection rate, however, for evacuees ranges from 0-2%.


Are Chinese stats incomplete because Wuhan was a complete clusterf*ck and some people slipped through the cracks? Of course! Is China under-reporting by a factor of 10-40x? Absolutely not. No evidence suggests that to be the case."

For the record, I've been a (as in for a job) Manager for over a decade, and moderator/admin of several forums, groups, and chats (not reddit though, couldn't pay me to do this job) for over 2 decades.  I'm not young.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""Hi, an ex mod of our sub is messaging individuals and other coronavirus subs in attempts to character assassinate myself, as well as this sub. Figured it's time for an explanation / AMA type thing.""

&#x200B;

\-> this is fair.  Nothing wrong with wanting the clear the water.  I will note, however, this is unnecessary if you already have the trust of your audience.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""2 weeks ago, Trump & Whitmer started going at it, hard. That weekend, our sub got brigaded, so to better respond to brigades and not have our sub descend into all politcal tit for tat arguments, I posted a want of new mods @ [https://reddit.com/r/CoronavirusMichigan/comments/frpc4g/we\_got\_brigaded\_saw\_your\_want\_of\_more\_rules\_we/](https://reddit.com/r/CoronavirusMichigan/comments/frpc4g/we_got_brigaded_saw_your_want_of_more_rules_we/) Quite simply, I needed help, and couldn't weather fighting brigades and spammers alone any longer.""

&#x200B;

\-> Political topics are always hard.  Nothing wrong in pointing people to the right place to voice their views.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""A former mod, DocIsIn, pushed for a discord user in particular to be a mod. The user setup our former discord, and contributed little to the sub, staying almost exclusively in discord only. ""

&#x200B;

\-> Note, if I understand properly, DocIsIn was a mod at the time in which he recommended someone.  He recommended someone he trusted, someone he trusts to perform mod duties elsewhere.  Someone tried, tested, and reliable.  Now, I don't know this other person, so I can't speak of them or their behavior, but this is how management works.  As a previous manager for nearly a decade, you only push up those you can trust to do the job.  You've glossed over this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""The user he recommended became upset, as I didn't respond to him or make him mod in 16 hours, and sent me 2 messages about how he was upset I didn't respond.""

&#x200B;

\-> Yeah, that's a shitty reflection of the person if they get upset.  Then again, my words will probably be read as an attack on you.  They aren't.  It's hard to grasp tone in writing.  Really hard.  Sometimes I read an email several times before I respond, because I think that maybe my mood influences it more than the person writing it.  Just as reading as the author intended, so too is writing what you intend.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""I didn't respond to anyone about becoming a mod in over a day IIRC, as I was working, and wanted time at night to review each candidate and their post history before making decisions. I wanted people with good post histories, not people who troll others, not new accounts, and people who contributed to this sub. Our former discord represented <1% of the followers or unique page views of our sub, and I didn't think it would be right to put the 1% of discord in charge of the 99% of reddit sub users here.""

&#x200B;

\-> this is a fair assessment.  Then again, sometimes the pool in which you draw talent limits the talent you draw.  This is why companies often hire management from outside.  Fresh ideas are good.  And good posters don't necessarily make good moderators.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""The first picture you saw joining discord was Elon Musk smoking a joint. IDC if anyone smokes, but I didn't believe Elon Musk smoking a joint is the first thing people should see joining a Michigan COVID-19 discord group.""

&#x200B;

\-> While I don't disagree... This is wholly political.  It's hard to NOT acknowledge this fact.  Cannabis, smoking, and Elon Musk all have a political bias against them.  It's a fact.  That said, I'm not sure why that matters right here right now.  This \_IS\_ reddit, after all.  In addition to that, the image of the discord is that of a virus... Are you complaining about his user profile?  Why?  Has nothing to do with reddit.  He isn't a mod of reddit.  You are.  Why bring it up?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""Thus between the creator of the discord becoming upset with me for not making him a mod, docisin upset his discord buddy wasn't made mod, turning discord against the sub, and Elon Musk smoking a joint, I chose to drop any official sponsoring of the discord group from our sub.""

&#x200B;

\-> Aside from this being somewhat unreadable... You're welcome to do whatever, as you are in fact the mod... But I find the inherency of your arguments are rather... unfounded.  As I understand everything above, it's hard to believe that coming out and blatantly painting someone as the bad guy here will do much for you other than root out others who think you're not doing a good job.  Well done!  I guess?  Staying silent or just saying ""We had some drama, it's resolved.""  Would have been a bit more effective.  No one needs to know the inner details.  By delving into some of them to paint a picture, you've created a scapegoat.  The only reason for a scapegoat would be to pin blame.  No need for that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""Private messages docisin has selectively culled in screenshots that I have yet seen are all accurate private messages between him and myself...the ones he's chosen to share. Docisin has chosen not to share all private messages between him and myself""

&#x200B;

\-> I've seen a few of them, this is true.  No argument here.  We all paint our own pictures with the brushes and colors we choose.  That wasn't likely right of him either.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"", as they would be extremely damaging to himself and his career. ""

&#x200B;

\-> This is an opinion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""If you remember what he used to post in the sub in the early days, you'll understand. I will be taking the high road and not sharing those as well.""

&#x200B;

\-> Creating a scapegoat is not the high road.  At this point its no worse if you just post all of the conversations.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""I still appreciate docisin's early contributions to the sub, and tried to end this peacefully a number of times if you've seen the messages.""

&#x200B;

\-> Maybe.  Hard to tell from the snipets from either side.  A lot of inflammation to go around.

&#x200B;

That's my analysis.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For the record, it wouldn't suprise me if I get banned for this post as a ""undermining moderators"" or some such, but that in of itself proof enough that the post is needed.  Rather, if it is so damaging, then the problem is so out of hand that perhaps this reddit needs some better guidance.  To be fair, This won't come across well, as I see lots of people being banned for say ""ah, this is bad.""  It look a lot like the end of a kindom movie where those in power are just ""Off with his head!"""

https://imgur.com/a/T22CXC9
* There was an excellent post a week ago showing a better way to graph to detect the improvement from exponential growth here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fqxgi7/how_to_tell_if_were_beating_covid19/ . I've started a graph using this model here, with South Korea showing the drop we'd like to see. We are not seeing the drop yet, but it does seem that the growth of the incoming rate has mostly levelled off over the last several days: https://imgur.com/a/33MSe86
* Here are some other graphs I'm playing with (MultiTrends): https://imgur.com/a/IPwOSzc

* Canadian data from virihealth.com (from PHAC & provinces), USA data from coronavirus.1point3acres.com, Other national data was from WHO sitrep 77.
* I am not an epidemiologist. I'm not a government employee. I don't even play a doctor on TV. I just like numbers.

This data is admittedly imperfect: testing is incomplete, there is a test backlog, and reporting is not completely fluid.  This is too simplistic a model for realistic projection, given all of the unknowns and variables of such a complex system.  That said, I'll continue to track this, to see where it goes.

Today's data notes:  

* People tested (+13,881) = 345,659 (0.91% of the population)
* Tested positive (+1153) = 16,666 (4.85% of those tested). The cumulative hit rate climbs from 4.68% yesterday, rising 13 days in a row. Rising hit rate suggests that we need more widespread testing. 
* Test backlog - total is 3954, down from 4407 yesterday. 
* 43 deaths today. The national total is 323 deaths (1.94% of known positives - this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed)
* Recovered = 3616 (21.7% of known positives).
* Known active = 12,727 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). The unknowns are unknown. 
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.
* The growth rate appears in cases seems to be slowing. Higher doubling time is better. March16 - doubling rate= every 2.84 days; March23=2.74 days; Mar30=4.21 days. These are averaged over a week, so I'll wait until next Thursday to update, but so far, it looks to improve more. 
* Hospitalizations/ICU: nationally 1350 people are hospitalized (+70 from yesterday) and 480 are in ICU (+32).  Virihealth.com is doing a much better job tracking and graphing these, but I did add a couple graphs in the MultiTrends graphs linked above. As these numbers climb, the burden on our healthcare workers will increase. Godspeed and thanks to them.
* In USA, deaths grew by >1200 today to top 10,000."

I didn't feel super short of breath...just the kind of fatigue/breathlessness you get with the flu or bad cold. Emptying the dishwasher wore me out. Whatever I had took almost a full month to finally go away. Never really had a headache, cough, and only had a fever once or twice for a few hours. Didn't feel any chest congestion - just in my nose.

This is a coronavirus and all other coronaviruses we’ve known about, when you have it and recover, you are immune for a period of time. I think the lowest was 1 year, but most are well over that. If your saying we should wait a year before releasing people back to work that wouldn’t make sense. We need to use scientific evidence as much as we can and evidence suggests that people who have had to will have immunity for 1+ years in a worst case. Could COVID-19 be different? Sure, but the only other option would be to enact stay at home until a vaccine is ready and that is 12-18 months away, at a minimum. It doesn’t make sense to keep stay at home enacted for that long a period of time when we can implement it again if we find immunity isn’t as long as we thought, or the 2nd wave is hitting. Of course we need to be cautious, but we also shouldn’t be so scared that we let millions of people go homeless and die on the streets, which is what’s going to happen if this stay at home is in effect until a vaccine is ready."

2020-04-06,goumy_tuc,france,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/fw3vxy/france_ou_canada/fmm69vl/,"Salut,
J'ai vécu et travaillé a nice, j'habite et je travaille maintenant à Montréal, je vais essayer de répondre à tout tes points.

Chômage : moins élevé au Canada en effet, cela dit en fonction de ton domaine c'est pas nécessairement un problème en France.
A savoir, le préavis pour quitter un emplois est généralement de deux semaines (3mois en France) ce qui fait que les gens sont plus mobile et changent plus souvent de job qu'en France.

Le côté passif agressif des Français : si tu trouves que les Français sont passif agressifs ça va te faire tout drôle, au Canada, ils en ont fait une marque de fabrique.

Système de santé : les deux sont assez similaires, pas parfait mais quand même suffisant.

Congés : grosse différence, en France on a minimum 5 semaines de congés par an + les rtt, quand je travaillais en France j'avais dans les 7 semaines de congés par an. 
Au Canada le minimum est ... 2 semaines, la plupart des jeunes travailleurs qualifiés en ont 3, je suis un privilégié avec mes 4 semaines. C'est peu.
Bon point pour le canada cela dit qui compense avec des congés pour les parents plus généreux qu'en France.

Travail/salaire : J'ai pas vu de grande différences en terme de temps de travail hebdomadaire. Les employeurs sont plus flexibles au Canada. A voir si le coronavirus va rendre les entreprises françaises moins frileuses vis a vis du télétravail.
Les salaires sont plus élèves au Canada, le coup de la vie aussi (dépends surtout de où tu veux aller), je te conseille de regarder sur Glassdoor pour te faire une idée (oublie pas de prendre en compte les impôts fédéral et provincial). 

Autre trucs a prendre en compte:
La météo, il faut froid l'hiver, l'hiver est long.
L'isolement géographique, les distances sont grande en Amérique du Nord, les transports coutent plus cher qu'en Europe. Tu feras moins d'escapade d'un week end.

Pour resumé, y a du positif et du négatif, certains adorent et ne repartiront jamais, certains partent après 2/3 ans et rentrent en France où tentent une autre aventure ailleurs. A toi de voir."

My theory is when the government lifts restrictions, we'll see a resurgence and then reimplementation. Rinse, wash, and repeat 2-3x.

After that, many people have learned how to work from home and will continue doing so. In Fall, we'll see another small resurgence due to dropping temps. At least in the Northern hemisphere. Maybe after a couple of years (maybe) we develop a vaccine and the Coronavirus kills as many people as the Flu every year. We get MOSTLY back to normal.

Will we ever go back to shaking hands? I'd be okay if we didn't but I'll miss Top Gun style high fives.

2020-04-06,guardianofpeez,Coronavirus,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fw09q4/petition_calling_for_resignation_of_who/fmmiawh/,"> The Chinese government's official position was that it was not transmissible from person to person AT ALL.

Because preliminary investigations had no clear evidence of sustained H2H transmission. You can't simply draw a H2H transmission conclusion because some nurses started to have a fever after treating patients. You need tests to confirm a case and China had no testing kits back then. 

> Silencing medical health professionals is extremely dangerous, they are not the average punter. 

Crisis management requires timely release of certified information. The government was already on the case. They were not hiding the facts, they were ascertaining them. Having people release information to the public before anything is confirmed causes unnecessary panic. 

> Chinese government knew it was a SARS like coronavirus for weeks and sat on the information.

They knew it was genetically similar to a SARS-like coronavirus as early as December 26.  And really? They ""sat on the information""? I wonder what your timeline of the investigation looks like because here's mine.

>8 January 2020, Scientists in China announced the discovery of a new coronavirus.

>10 January 2020, full gene sequencing data of the virus was published to the international community.

2020-04-06,Neutral-Good,AmazonFC,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/fw5x7s/nyt_article_no_paywall/fmmpyfb/,"On March 16, Jeysson Manrique, an employee of a delivery company that contracts with Amazon, woke up with a fever. His body ached. He called his supervisor to say he was sick. Mr. Manrique, 29, was asked to text a picture of his temperature on a thermometer. He couldn’t find one, so he went in for his shift at an Amazon facility in Queens. Amazon said it was investigating the situation with the contracting company because its policy requires employees stay home if they feel sick.

Two days later, Mr. Manrique’s father-in-law — they live together in a house with other members of the family — was sorting packages at the same facility when his doctor called to tell him that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. His father-in-law shared his test results with his supervisors and went home.

When the warehouse closed for cleaning, he was the first publicly known case inside Amazon’s vast warehouse operations in the United States. Mr. Manrique joined his father-in-law and other members of the household in quarantine without venturing out for a test.

On March 23, rumors circulated at the Queens facility that another employee had tested positive. Hours later, there were whispers of a third. The building was shut down March 24 and March 25 for deep cleaning. The company had also begun instructing warehouses to keep employees apart, staggering when they arrive and canceling group meetings at the start of shifts.

Some workers said they were still handling products that were helpful but hardly critical. One warehouse employee posted a picture on social media of moving large boxes, including a Power Wheels Jeep that a child can ride, with the hashtags #SoManyPingPongTables and #TreadmillsAreEssentialProductsApparently.

Ira Pollock, an employee in the Queens facility who has organized other workers, said having people show up to ship nonessential items endangered the community. “Amazon has to earn its right to call itself an essential service,” he said.

“The priorities are the priorities,” Mr. Carney said. “We’re not going to ship a prom dress or a Ping-Pong table if that’s going to slow down in any way the intake or outflow of essential items.”

A ‘particularly insufficient’ response

When Amazon announced unlimited unpaid leave, it also said it would pay two weeks of sick time for “all Amazon employees diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed into quarantine.” On Friday, a day after it received questions from The Times about the situation, Amazon said it had issued a check for Mr. Manrique’s father-in-law, who is ending his second week of quarantine.

Documents viewed by The Times show that workers around the country applied for leave without a formal diagnosis. The workers said they had compromised immune systems or had been ordered to stay home because of contact with someone who was sick, but did not have the paperwork required to qualify for paid time off.

In a number of cases, employees continued to work after showing symptoms but before their tests came back positive — when they would be eligible for paid leave. One person in New York started having symptoms on March 18 but did not stop working until March 25, when she went into quarantine, the documents show.

Amazon said workers could still use unlimited unpaid or regular paid sick time off, if they had accrued enough hours.

“Paid leave is important,” said Dr. David Michaels, a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration who teaches at George Washington University, “because you need to do everything you can to ensure that potentially sick workers stay home in order not to infect co-workers and others in the public.”

On March 25, the attorneys general in 14 states and Washington, D.C., wrote a letter to Amazon saying the requirement for testing or a formal quarantine was “particularly insufficient given the realities of the public health crisis, where the lack of access to Covid-19 testing has been widely reported.” Two days later, Amazon expanded its policy.

Mr. Carney said the leave policy had been developed at a time when Amazon expected testing to be widely available.

“When it became clear that the complete scarcity of tests was an obstacle to people finding out whether or not they had Covid, we made it clear that the additional paid time off applied to people who had suspected they had Covid,” he said.

But the message has not reached everyone. The internal website for warehouse employees has not been updated, and on Monday, a warehouse employee in the South asked for paid leave after her child tested positive. In an email viewed by The Times, the employee was told to take unpaid time off “as you wait for test results.”

While Amazon said it could not confirm the situation, it added that that response did not reflect its policy and that any employee caring for someone with a doctor-diagnosed case of Covid-19 should receive up to two weeks of pay."

Another COVID-19 study involving 38 patients from Hubei province that specifically looked at conditions relating to the eye found that a dozen of them had eye-related symptoms including “conjunctival congestion”. Eight of the 12 patients were considered “severe” or “critical” cases, suggesting that these **ocular symptoms were more common in patients with severe pneumonia**, the study’s authors wrote.

“Because **unprotected eyes** were associated with an **increased risk of transmission** of SARS-CoV-1, in support of our current results, our results might suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted through the eye,” the authors wrote. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-1 is the virus behind SARS, which caused dozens of deaths in Canada and hundreds in China and Hong Kong in 2003.

The study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association also found that patients with the eye-related symptoms also **had a greater likelihood of having higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts**, as well as **higher C-reactive protein levels** - all indicators of **possible infection** - than patients without eye-symptoms. High levels of other blood test values including **lactate dehydrogenase**, which may indicate **tissue damage**, were also found."""

There are passages and sections of the Bible that Baha'i Writings and texts do take as referring to the Baha'i Faith symbolically and many Baha'i books on the subject written by Baha'is from a Christian background.  So, you might be surprised by that and the way it is explained, I was at first coming from a moderate Methodist belief. (The same is true for Islam which is sadly misunderstood and improperly presented.

**The harmony of science and religion is a fundamental principle of our religion.**   We accept the concept that humanity evolved over time and inherited traits from that evolution We accept modern science, consult competent physicians for illnesses, and are encouraged to be highly educated and to serve humanity (work in the service of humanity is a form of worship).  In fact, some of our Writings have comments about evolution, chemistry, nuclear power, and such.  Baha'u'llah even warned about nuclear power in His Writings as ""hidden"" and His Son, 'Abdu'l-Baha warned a Japanese Ambassador about nuclear power in 1911 in Paris.

**First of all, independent investigation of the truth is a principle of the Baha'i Faith**.  Sometimes you will find a Baha'i or two who can be a bit more aggressive, but we are required to respect your right to choose what you want to believe and simply present what we believe and teach.

**Second, you would definitely not be wasting your time even if you never become a Baha'i or don't have an interest in becoming a Baha'i.**  Try to ensure you can meet a Baha'i who can address your concerns and interests and don't be afraid to ask questions.  Our Faith has a much larger Scripture and authoritative texts and there are many answers to many questions that can be found even online now.  The use of reason is highly regarded and you are  encouraged to inquire.

If the Baha'i Center is established or the community has more resources, they likely have a lending library and books you can skim or read there and may have books that they provide like some of the introductory texts about the Faith.  It may be closed at this time due to the coronavirus concerns but a lot of times Baha'i Centers have time set aside for persons wanting to investigate, for study sessions, devotionals, or other things, although a lot is not often done in homes or in neighborhoods even when a community has a Center.  The Scripture of the Baha'i Faith is quite extensive, so it can be a bit overwhelming at first."

A large reason for this is those who die from COVID but never went to a hospital, or die before being tested, are not being tested after the fact. 

There are reports that the death toll in [China could be 15-40x](https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-residents-say-chinese-government-coronavirus-death-toll-is-low-2020-3) the recorded number based on morgue/cremation traffic after the lockdown. There was [another report](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/coronavirus-is-only-part-of-the-excess-fatality-mystery.html) that the annual death rate in Italy is up 6x from previous years, with COVID deaths only accounting for a quarter of the change. 

While, in general, the death rate of the virus is likely much lower than we currently see it, it isn't as low as you might hope. People just die in too large of numbers to record them all accurately as COVID deaths. It will be very interesting to look at the total number of deaths in 2020 worldwide compared to the last few years."

A Goodyear welt refers to the construction of the boot, and put simply, it is fairly easy to resole. This allows you to keep a single pair of boots for years. 

I have a few pairs of red wings myself, and love them all very much. I work in men's fashion and sell red wings quite a bit. However, 3 pairs is probably borderline too much. A lot of people refer to Red Wings (myself included) as a pair of ""lifetime boots"", and they really are. You will probably be able to keep them your whole life if you maintain them properly. It's funny to see posts saying ""this is the last pair of boots I'll ever buy!!"" and then see a post from the same person a month or two later and seeing they have multiple pairs. There is a reason why people buy more, and it is because the boots are very, very well built, and you look damn good in them. But, how many pairs of lifetime boots do you need?

I love Red Wings, and as I've gotten to know the people who work there more, it makes me love the company even more. It is an investment, but it is 110 percent worth it.

It's a lot harder to get help (or get away from an abuser) if you're supposed to all be home. More knowledge about services like domestic abuse hotlines (1-800-799-7233 in the US) is important. More broadly, a lot of nonprofits that service people who don't speak english or don't have internet/computer knowledge are noting that things are especially hard for those who've relied on in-person services in the past. Some of those nonprofits can't work right now because they don't have PPE, even if they are considered essential services. Also, a lot of nonprofits benefit from in-person fundraisers that have now been canceled--so donate to nonprofits you care about, especially small, local ones!

One thing I personally care about a lot is the amount of death this could cause if coronavirus gets into my local jails and prisons. Most people (around 70% in the US) who are in local jails haven't actually been convicted of anything--they're pretrial (in most cases). Those people's trials are sometimes getting delayed, and they're sitting in jail without being convicted of the crime they're accused of. I think that's unfair, and dangerous."

https://www.physiciansweekly.com/mortality-rate-of-covid-19-patients-on-ventilators/

We have some early published data on percentages which vary widely. A paper from China involved 710 Covid-19 patients; 52 were admitted to an ICU. Of the 22 who eventually required mechanical ventilation, 19 (86%) died. Another early study reported 31 of 32 (97%) mechanically ventilated patients died.

I posed the following question on Twitter: “What is the mortality rate for [COVID-19] patients who require mechanical ventilation?” and received answers ranging from 25% to 70% from people who have personal knowledge of outcomes in their hospitals.

Probably the best published information we have so far is from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Center (ICNARC) in the UK. Of 165 patients admitted to ICUs, 79 (48%) died. Of the 98 patients who received advanced respiratory support—defined as invasive ventilation, BPAP or CPAP via endotracheal tube, or tracheostomy, or extracorporeal respiratory support—66% died.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-intensive-care-uk-patients-50-per-cent-survival-rate?CMP=share_btn_tw

This article was amended on 30 March 2020. The headline and first paragraph referred to a 50% mortality/survival rate for coronavirus patients admitted to ICU. Calculations of case fatality rates are complex while an outbreak is ongoing and, although one method can be to divide the number of deaths by the number of deaths plus recovered patients (ie to look only at those patients for whom an outcome is known), its reliability depends on the extent to which the outcome for patients still in treatment can be assumed to be similar. The ICNARC report on which the article’s calculations were based is early data in the Covid-19 outbreak. As such, a small sample of 165 patients, which could be biased towards the most and least severe cases, may not be indicative of the outcome for all those admitted to critical care. The headline, introduction and later reference to death rates have been amended accordingly."

The 1918 spanish flu is thought by many to have originated from either chickens or pigs in Kansas.  Camels, which I have seen in animal auctions/sale barns being housed right next to cattle and other large animals, are the origins of MERS (although it does not appear to have originated in the US, instead it was the Middle East).  Basically, any animal that can catch a flu or Coronavirus has the potential to transmit that to humans. There are even prion diseases in farmed and wild animals alike that are prevalent in the US, such as chronic wasting disease in cervids like deer, that have the potential to make the jump to humans.

I will admit that I am not an expert either, and while recent newsworthy zoonotic virus have tended to originate from China/Africa, the US has had to deal with plenty of Salmonella, E. Coli, and cryptosporidium outbreaks itself. I think a big part is just luck and better medical care than developing nations."

## About COVID-19

### What are coronaviruses?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses cause  illness in humans and others cause illness in animals, such as bats,  camels, and civets. Human coronaviruses generally cause mild illness,  such as the common cold.

Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve to infect and spread among humans, causing severe diseases such as [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/SARS.aspx) which emerged in 2002, and [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/MERS-coronavirus.aspx) which emerged in 2012.

### What is the COVID-19 virus?

COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously  identified in humans. It was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province,  China, where it has caused a large and ongoing outbreak. It has since  spread more widely in China. Cases have since been identified in several  other countries. The COVID-19 virus is closely related to a bat  coronavirus.

There is much more to learn about how COVID-19 is spread, its  severity, and other features associated with the virus; epidemiological  and clinical investigations are ongoing. 

Outbreaks of new coronavirus infections among people are always a public health concern. The situation is evolving rapidly."

> Patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia require isolation and SARS-CoV-2 tests (measure 3). Systemic and local respiratory defense mechanisms are compromised, resulting in bacterial co-infection if early, effective antiviral treatment is not started. **Empirical therapy** consists of oral moxifloxacin or levofloxacin (consider tolerance) and **arbidol**. Arbidol is approved in China and Russia for influenza treatment. In-vitro studies showed that arbidol had inhibitory effects on SARS. Patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 are transferred to designated hospitals.

Is there some fundamental difference in medical philosophy between China and the West?  Because the Chinese used arbidol it seems because it was available without their doctors getting hung up on whether there was a published peer reviewed journal article proving arbidol's effectiveness in a random trial."

>[Abstract] Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with common coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Methods: We prospectively enrolled 30 treatment-naïve patients with confirmed COVID-19 after informed consent at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The patients were randomized 1:1 to HCQ group and the control group. Patients in HCQ group were given HCQ 400 mg per day for 5 days plus conventional treatments, while those in the control group were given conventional treatment only. The primary endpoint was negative conversion rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid in respiratory pharyngeal swab on days 7 after randomization. This study has been approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai public health clinical center and registered online (NCT04261517). 

>Results: One patient in HCQ group developed to severe during the treatment. **On day 7, COVID-19 nucleic acid of throat swabs was negative in 13 (86.7%) cases in the HCQ group and 14 (93.3%) cases in the control group (P>0.05). The median duration from hospitalization to virus nucleic acid negative conservation was 4 (1-9) days in HCQ group, which is comparable to that in the control group [2 (1-4) days, (U = 83.5, P>0.05)]. The median time for body temperature normalization in HCQ group was 1 (0-2) after hospitalization, which was also comparable to that in the control group 1 (0-3). Radiological progression was shown on CT images in 5 cases (33.3%) of the HCQ group and 7 cases (46.7%) of the control group, and all patients showed improvement in follow-up examination. Four cases (26.7%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function (P> 0.05).** Conclusions: The prognosis of common COVID-19 patients is good. Larger sample size study are needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. Subsequent research should determine better endpoint and fully consider the feasibility of experiments such as sample size.

What's True
During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying ""this is their new hoax."" During the speech he also seemed to downplay the severity of the outbreak, comparing it to the common flu.

They criticized his lack of response and he said it was a hoax."

His “I don’t want to make this political” seems honest—he genuinely doesn’t want to make statements that could be viewed as political.

Does *everyone* have to shit on trump at *all times* lest they be criticized? Seriously—I’m genuinely curious what you want him to do


Like...Jesus. I fucking despise Donald trump. I didn’t vote for him in 2016 and I won’t be voting for him in 2020. In my view, he has fucked up the coronavirus response damn near as badly as he possibly could’ve fucked it up.

""Recently, I had a telephone briefing with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Dr.    Anthony Fauci, who provided an update on the coronavirus outbreak and how we can all work together to flatten the curve. I want to remind everyone that the best way we can stay healthy and safe is by following social distancing guidelines, staying home, and continuing to wash our hands.

In a matter of weeks, the coronavirus has completely upended how everyone in Nebraska and around the world is living their lives. To respond to this crisis, Congress unanimously     passed the CARES Act, which President Trump then signed into law. It provides relief for families, hospitals, businesses, and our communities. Guidance on how you can access this relief is now being released.

**Attention Small Business Owners:**

On April 4th, the Small Business Administration's [***Paycheck Protection Program***](http://ct.symplicity.com/t/fischer/3c79a54774db49ab821bbbf4f7e46ba5/4241328072/realurl=https:/www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program-ppp?fbclid=IwAR2oaIvjw_YtQtG7hM7cTei6SV-JEg6Bhol5m9bJp90MftAhrye4CHs5rcw),  which was created through the CARES Act, began taking applications for loans. These loans are meant to help our small businesses keep workers employed, pay overhead, and avoid closing down for good during this pandemic. Small businesses are the backbone of Nebraska's economy, and they employ nearly half of our workforce.

**More Federal Resources on the Way to NE:**

President Trump approved a major disaster declaration for Nebraska. I led our state's     congressional delegation in echoing Governor Ricketts' request for this assistance. The declaration will make federal funding available to assist our state in combatting the outbreak of COVID-19.

**Direct Payments Coming in About  Three Weeks:**

During my telephone briefing, Secretary Mnuchin informed everyone that individual direct payments will start arriving in approximately the next three weeks for those who qualify.     The Treasury Department also clarified that recipients of Social Security will be sent a check directly or through direct deposit. They do not have to file taxes.

**Watch Out for Scammers:**

Sadly, bad actors often exploit crises to take advantage of others, and COVID-19 scams are reportedly on the rise. The IRS will not be making house calls, sending emails, text     messages, or social media posts asking for personal financial information. Remind your friends and loved ones of this to help prevent them from falling prey to these scammers. Visit [***IRS.gov***](http://ct.symplicity.com/t/fischer/3c79a54774db49ab821bbbf4f7e46ba5/4241328072/realurl=https:/www.irs.gov/) for up-to-date information.

**Nebraskans Abroad, Now is the Time to Come Home:**

With coronavirus travel bans and countries closing their borders, it is challenging for Nebraskans who are overseas to find a way home. Since January 29th, the U.S. State Department has repatriated 33,500 Americans from over 60 countries to the United States.     However, as this pandemic continues to grow, the State Department cannot guarantee they can get everyone back to the U.S. if they wait to seek assistance. If you have a friend or a relative who is still abroad and needs assistance, please contact my office at 402-441-4600 so we can help get them home.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to my office directly if you are in need of assistance.

We are living through a very difficult time. I know people are scared and stressed. But I also know that people are praying for each other and for our country. Nebraskans are kind,     caring, and compassionate, and many are reaching out to help each other as we all battle this virus. 

I hope you and your families are staying well.

Citizens are prohibited from leaving their homes for ""nonessential"" reasons (like grocery shopping, healthcare, etc). If law enforcement sees you somewhere you shouldn't be, or doing an activity you aren't permitted to do, they can send you away. (some states they can fine you or even arrest you).

The list of states who haven't done this is shorter than ones who have. The ones who haven't yet are Arkansas, Iowa, South Dakata, North Dakota, and Nebraska.

Utah, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and South Carolina have parts of the state under lockdown, but the rest of the state is doing what we are doing.

To the valued clients of the Cat Clinic and Hospital,

Veterinary care continues to be an essential service, and the Cat Clinic and Hospital will     remain open during the COVID-19 pandemic. As an update to our COVID-19 policies to keep our staff and clients safe, we have added the option of curbside service for appointments:

\-Please bring **your cat in a carrier**, as usual, to your appointment. When you arrive, pull     your car partially into the driveway so that you are near the front entrance. Next, call the office and inform the staff if you would like your  cat picked up from the car or if you would like to drop your cat off in the front vestibule (the small entryway in between the front door and the lobby  door). You may remain in your car, either in the driveway or back parking lot, during the appointment. The doctor can call you after the     exam/treatment, and a staff member can arrange payment, dispense medication     if needed, and ask if you would like your cat brought to your car or if you would like to pick your cat up from the front vestibule. **Remember, cats  must be in carriers for all visits.**

As a reminder, we are asking clients who are sick (respiratory disease or fever) or have     potentially been exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19 to not bring your cats into the clinic. If your cat has an urgent need, please call the office.

Going to the hospital is dangerous right now. Pregnant women can't take some of the medication. Babies are vulnerable in the first days/weeks/months. Breastfeeding becomes more complicated. Visiting relatives are a risk and generate worries rather than joy.

\-  Pregnancy alters a woman’s immune system, which puts her at a higher risk for severe complications if she catches a dangerous virus like the flu.

\-  Two pregnant women at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City who had both Covid-19 and underlying health conditions declined rapidly after delivering their babies and were admitted to the intensive care unit

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), sometimes less precisely called immune enhancement, occurs when non-neutralizing antiviral proteins facilitate virus entry into host cells, leading to increased infectivity in the cells.

There are various hypotheses on how this may happen and a likelihood that more than one mechanism exists. In one such pathway, some cells do not have the usual receptors on their surfaces that viruses use to gain entry. The antiviral proteins (i.e., the antibodies) bind to antibody Fc receptors that some of these cells have in the plasma membrane.

2020-04-06,Neutral-Good,AmazonFC,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/fw5x7s/nyt_article_no_paywall/fmmpxk1/,"SEATTLE — Jonathan Bailey, a 30-year-old Amazon warehouse employee in Queens, has a system for protecting himself from the coronavirus at work. He wears a medical mask with a bandanna tied over it. When he returns to the apartment he shares with his wife, he dumps his mask, work gloves, neon green Amazon safety vest and other clothes into a plastic trash bag.

He’s not certain it really works, but he figures it’s better than nothing. “We’re very careful,” Mr. Bailey said. “We’re in the epicenter of it all.”

As millions of Americans heed government orders to hunker down, ordering food and medicines and books and puzzle boards for home delivery, many of Amazon’s 400,000 warehouse workers have stayed on the job, fulfilling the crushing demands of a country suddenly working and learning from home. Orders for Amazon groceries, for example, have been as much as 50 times higher than normal, according to a person with direct knowledge of the business.

The challenge is keeping enough people on the job to fill those orders, according to more than 30 Amazon warehouse workers and current and former corporate employees who spoke with The New York Times. (Many requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly and feared losing their jobs.) For all of its high-tech sophistication, Amazon’s vast e-commerce business is dependent on an army of workers operating in warehouses they now fear are contaminated with the coronavirus.

“None of this works without our employees,” said Jay Carney, the company’s senior vice president for corporate affairs. And the employees have been motivated to remind Amazon of their importance.

The surge of orders is testing the limits of Amazon’s vaunted distribution system and forcing changes to the company’s relationship with its employees. While Amazon’s workers are not unionized, the crisis has given workplace organizers like Mr. Bailey unexpected leverage to demand better pay, better sick leave and more of a voice in how the company is run.

By mid-March, attendance at Amazon warehouses had fallen as much as 30 percent, according to one corporate employee involved in the response. This week, small groups of employees protested working conditions in Michigan and on Staten Island. New York State and New York City officials also said they were investigating whether Amazon improperly retaliated against a worker it fired who had been involved in the protest.

Amazon said that it did not fire employees for speaking out about their workplace conditions and that it had fired the worker because he was on paid quarantine and violated safety measures by going to the on-site protest. But in a leaked memo published Thursday by Vice, Amazon’s top lawyer called the fired worker inarticulate and discussed strategy for making him out to be the face of the worker movement.

David Zapolsky, the general counsel, said he had been frustrated by what he called a safety violation. “I let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me,” he said.

Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker, both of New Jersey, recently wrote to Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, to express concern about warehouse safety. The senators, all Democrats, condemned Mr. Zapolsky’s remarks in statements to The Times.

“It’s troubling, racist and has no place in our country,” Mr. Menendez said. “Amazon should do everything it can to protect its workers instead of disparaging them.”

Amazon said that at the time he made the comments, Mr. Zapolsky was not aware that the fired worker was black.

Amazon’s response to the pandemic has differed from warehouse to warehouse. Over the years, that sort of autonomy has allowed Amazon to nimbly adjust to local market conditions. Now it is leading to distrust, as workers see some facilities close for cleaning while others remain open.

Since the first worker in the Queens facility learned on March 18 that he had tested positive, the company has learned of cases in more than 50 other facilities, out of the more than 500 it operates across the country.

In recent weeks, Amazon has raised wages and added quarantine leave, and it is offering overtime at double pay. It said it had tripled its janitorial staff. And it has added space between many workstations. But in private groups, conversations with their managers and public protests, some workers have expressed alarm about their safety.

Mr. Carney said the company had been cautious about telling workers about cases out of privacy concerns and because one of its first likely cases, a corporate employee in Europe, turned out not to have the virus. He said Amazon was managing the needs of its workers and the public the best it could in a situation for which no company has a real playbook.

“We’re pushing out these new rules as we decide on them,” Mr. Carney said. But some warehouses acted more rapidly on the policies than others. “Compliance has been unbelievably good but not perfect,” he said. On Thursday, Amazon announced that it would audit warehouses’ compliance with the rules.

For Amazon, like many companies in America, the danger of the coronavirus started as a problem in its supply chain. The company was concerned about acquiring products that were made in China, and by mid-February, it was placing larger orders than normal to stockpile supplies.

But on Feb. 27, Amazon learned that an employee in Europe who had traveled to Milan had contracted the virus. It immediately halted all nonessential travel, including within the United States, making it the first known major company to suspend domestic travel.

In the first week of March, Amazon told its headquarters employees to work from home. Warehouse employees were later offered unlimited unpaid time off instead. Workers would normally be fired after missing too many shifts, so Mr. Carney said the message that executives hoped to convey with the new policy was: “You won’t lose your job, don’t worry.”

Many workers did stay home, just as panic buying set in — first for masks and hand sanitizer, then toilet paper and eventually webcams. Eric Heller, a former Amazon senior manager who advises major brands at Wunderman Thompson Commerce, said his clients saw canned meat sales rise 700 percent. Pet food went up 300 percent.

Companies began sending in products to restock Amazon’s warehouses. But with attendance down and more items coming in, workers could not replenish the supplies fast enough. Trucks backed up, waiting days to be unloaded. The company offered shift after extra shift, raised wages $2 an hour and paid double the hourly rate for overtime. It eventually announced that it would hire 100,000 new workers.

In mid-March, Amazon stopped accepting new shipments into its warehouses that were not for priority products, like health care and baby supplies."

It’s not the unemployed population, it’s the weekly unemployment claims. The unemployment population can be thought of as the difference between the integral of this graph, and the integral of the graph of people going off of unemployment benefits into a new job.

This spike looks like it dwarfs everything that’s ever happened, but it doesn’t really (at least not yet, but knock on wood). During the 2009 crisis (and pretty much all other recessions) unemployment does tend to skyrocket to very large numbers, but these are relatively spread out over time as businesses fold at different times. This time, almost all businesses were forced to downscale effective immediately, which leads to more people claiming unemployment in a shorter stretch of time.

Unemployment due to the coronavirus right now is at about 10 million, while during the height of the 2009 crisis it would at about 27-30 million (I couldn’t find an exact number). The good news is, though, that most unemployed individuals as of right now still have jobs when the crisis ends, they’re just temporarily not working.

This isn’t meant to downplay the seriousness of the issue, but people should understand what this graph means - it’s also not nearly as bad as it looks if you didn’t know."

The article does say it would be useless in a pandemic situation but this article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/face-mask-protect-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/face-mask-protect-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted)) mentions that infected particles could pass through the eyes. A plague doctor mask would eliminate that possibility, right? For the most part anyway? A plague doctor mask covers up the nose and mouth, too. But that very article tells about how a standard face mask is able to catch any droplets. For maximum effectiveness could I wear both?

With all due respect, you might want to double check your information. The virus is droplet-borne, correct. Surgical masks block the large droplets, correct

However, surgical masks cannot filter out the smaller droplets (which also contain the virus). That's what N95 respirators are for.

Also, surgical masks do not form a seal around your mouth and nose, you can still breathe in some of the larger droplets (to a lesser extent).

Surgical masks do not protect you from this coronavirus. However, if you are sick while wearing one, they limit your chance of infecting others.

But in all cases, I wholeheartedly agree with you that we need to save these masks for the healthcare professionals. Our selfishness is contributing to the deaths of so many people around the globe."

That is like one in thousand chance of test kits malfunctioning.
False negative is much more common,  Coronavirus start in lower respiratory at early stage, so it may not be detected by a swab at nose or throat.  
When the first death occurred in China in mid-Jan, the doctors didn’t detect virus in upper respiratory of dead body at beginning, and mistakenly concluded human transmission is unlikely.  Which was corrected a few days later, and started lockdown.

Think test kits as mouse trap, if a mouse is caught, then most likely there was mouse in the houses, except the cases someone is pranking on you.   In no mouse is caught, there are still chances it’s in the house."

fruits and vegetables can be left in a bowl of water + hydrogen peroxide. I think from studies 1% is enough to deactivate the virus.

depends on use-case but overall 1% solution is enough to deactivate the virus.

**The Jehovah’s Witnesses church lady, and how shame was averted**

APRIL 6, 2020 

BY RICK SNEDEKER
  
- This coronavirus joke I found on a nontheist website called Childhood’s End gently pokes fun at the relentless door-to-door proselytizing of Christianity’s **Jehovah’s Witnesses** sect.

>>> If you get an email with the subject: ""Kock Knock"" --- Don't open it ---

It's a Jehova Witness working from home >>>


It’s best to criticize gently, because even die-hard, hard-core, fundamentalist Bible-thumpers, like the **Witnesses**, can be and generally are (in my experience) exceedingly nice, authentic people with true hearts.

For instance, years ago when my wife and I lived in the lovely, woodsy countryside about 10 miles outside Rapid City, South Dakota, one particular Witness — a very tiny, tidy woman I’d guess was in her late 70s — periodically appeared at our doorstep, black patent-leather handbag in hand, to tell us about Jesus.

She was the sweetest little old lady ever, and I didn’t have the heart to ruin her day by informing her I was as unrepentantly atheist as she was not. So, I smiled and politely listened to her spiel, accepting without snarky comment on the latest issue of **The Watchtower** she always handed me as she left.

She was the opposite of hard-sell, just calmly but resolutely going about her business of spreading the Lord’s word to all who would listen. Gentle decency just surrounded her, like an aura.

I remember one 5-below winter morning, snow still on the ground from a quiet storm the night before, I looked out our front window as someone in a car dropped her off by our mailbox. In her shiny patent-leather church shoes, holding her equally shiny purse by its short strap, she gingerly trekked up our snowy driveway to knock on our door for God.

And once again, I listened and smiled, took my copy of The Watchtower and watched as she padded back down the driveway to the waiting car.

Another time, she quietly appeared at the front door before knocking (we didn’t have a bell), and my wife saw her through the door’s glass panel.

I didn’t, as I walked from the bathroom in a direction that would have taken me right past the front door, where the aged Witness stood. At that moment, I was, uh, in my birthday suit, and my wife from her vantage in the living room saw a potential catastrophe of biblical portent unfolding. From halfway across the room, I saw her eyes abruptly widen to an alarming size, which blessedly slowed me just enough so that I caught a glimpse of our saintly visitor before she glimpsed (OMG!) me.

Whew! I had never changed directions faster in my life. Saved (so to speak).

After quickly dressing, I greeted my faithful friend at the front door. I listened to her for a few minutes tell me about the peace that could be mine, received my latest copy of The Watchtower and once again watched her walk peacefully, contentedly away.

Although I’m not one iota less of a nontheist today, I can confirm that this kindly little woman did, in a sense, “save” me — from permanent unyielding cynicism about human nature. For which I am grateful.

There really are very good, honorable people out there who still believe all kinds of nonsense. In fact, I can’t say for sure that I don’t myself.

They're very very broad powers, and since the virus is asymptomatic in most people, it essentially gives them the power to tell you to go home (direct to a location) or arrest someone if they feel like it 'I suspected him/her of being potentially infectious' will hold up in almost all courts because unless you have a antibody test result on you, they can suspect anyone of that.

Basically, we have **no** civil liberties in the UK anymore, and we can only HOPE it's as temporary as they said.

e: oh, and re:

> The law clearly makes an allowance for exercise as long as social distancing is observed

Yes, but they're just guidelines, the police can override them if they want. And being gobby to the police is almost certainly likely to make them want."
