This is what the abstract says:

>We are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV). The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity /similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature. This work provides yet unknown insights on 2019-nCoV and sheds light on the evolution and pathogenicity of this virus with important implications for diagnosis of this virus.

Dude is just making shit up then covering his ass with ""scary if true"" despite his slant towards wanting you to believe it was engineered(even when the study repeats over and over that more research is required).

I mean, he calls it ""Chinese virus"" FFS even when you can see the abstract specifically labels it 2019-nCoV and common parlance recognizes ""coronavirus"".

While none of the measures are guaranteed to specifically help against coronavirus, there's at least a good chance that if it works for rhinovirus and influenza, it'll probably help.

Based on that, while masks and hand sanitizer get a lot of attention, I think there's some other things that you should stockpile now while they're still available:
* Antiseptic mouthwash
* Zinc supplements
* Interferon
* Probiotics
* Broncho-Vaxom

You can't point a smart thermoscan and then ""pop"" congrats you caught a coronavirus patient. There no such thing.

TLDR: Ga ada stick 2 garis untuk tes korona.

No, there is no misinformation here.

>That means health care workers interacting with a coronavirus patient should wear a **heavy-duty mask called an N95 respirator**.

>Although N95s are disposable, workers must also **demonstrate that they know how to put on and wear the model that they are using**.

>While N95 respirators are available for the public to purchase, **there's no recommendation from health agencies for the general public to wear them**.



> Where do folks like you get off on preaching this ""offers no protection"" business, when that is patently untrue?

Because…[*facemasks* are not the same as *respirators*](https://www.ohscanada.com/overtime/face-masks-vs-respirators/).

>**What is a face mask?**

> A face mask is a loose-fitting mask that covers the nose and mouth area. They have two ear loops that stretch around the ears to hold the mask in place. Face masks are designed to be used as **one-way protection only**, only capturing large particles or droplets from the wearer and preventing them from being spread to the environment. They are typically used to **prevent the spread of common colds and the flu**. Contrary to belief, **face masks do not protect the wearer at all**. Typically, most face masks do not have any protection factor assigned to them and are not NIOSH (National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health)-approved apparatuses.

>**What is a respirator?**

> A respirator is a tight-fitting mask that creates a facial seal. Each respirator, when used properly, will create a facial seal that **will provide two-way protection**, filtering the air entering and exiting the wearer at a level of efficiency designated by the respirator or filter/cartridge (half-face and full-face). Respirators come in three distinct categories:

> 1. Disposable (typically N95 and healthcare uses)
> 2. Half-face
> 3. Full-face"

*Most of the infected patients were men (30 \[73%\] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 \[32%\]), including diabetes (eight \[20%\]), hypertension (six \[15%\]), and cardiovascular disease (six \[15%\]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 \[98%\] of 41 patients), cough (31 \[76%\]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 \[44%\]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 \[28%\] of 39), headache (three \[8%\] of 38), haemoptysis (two \[5%\] of 39), and diarrhoea (one \[3%\] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days \[IQR 5·0-13·0\]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 \[29%\]), RNAaemia (six \[15%\]), acute cardiac injury (five \[12%\]) and secondary infection (four \[10%\]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. Interpretation: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.* 

&#x200B;

a third of these people had already suffered from previous illness! 2/3rds were exposed to the Huanan seafood market and the 32% who went into ICU had higher plasma levels. And ""only"" six patients succumbed."

Now I'm sure you've all got questions about the future, so I'll give the most important updates. In the year 2021 with coronavirus ever a threat to humanity, researches find that the cure to coronavirus is actually lyme disease.


In the year 2024, it is actually found that ~~Ginaulṱ~~ was the original patent holder to the submariner and oyster case design. Hans Wilsdorf had bullied Mr. ~~Ginaulṱ~~ into giving it up during the early days of Rolex. With such breaking news, demand for Rolex plummeted as people didn't want to be seen wearing a homage. ~~Ginaulṱ~~ meanwhile sees an ever increasing demand with the original Ocean Rover regularly breaking auction records. Steinhart ends up buying out Rolex during this crisis.


In 2028. Mr. Gentry himself, with the boom of his Facebook group, TGV ends up buying Squale outright. Limited edition models start appearing with TGV's face adorning the dial along with his family crest. Not much has changed in his videos, it's still mostly about Squale's brilliant history as a watchmaker. He still claims that his reviews and opinions about Squale are unbiased.


Around the same time, Paul Pluta realises he can no longer sustain his luxury collection with just $20 SOTC reviews on Youtube and decides to open an OnlyFans page. He no longer has a fridge with the names of his sponsors in his background, instead opting for a whiteboard with the names of his monthly top dono's


With the downfall of Rolex, Bark & Jack runs out of topics to talk about. After seeing the success of Paul Pluta with his OnlyFans page, decides to open one himself. He keeps the branding B&J, although it no longer stands for Bark & Jack.


Now before I go guys, I just want to quickly tell you about this extremely cool app that WatchBox™ have launched. This is my own personal go to app for everything watch related. Using the app you can keep track of the real time value of your Squale collection. You can store watches in your digital WatchBox™ and even try on watches using an augmented reality. So don't miss out and please go to the app store and download it today. You can access all of my latest videos right there in the app itself. Ok ciao."

China with all its censorship and closed internet told their citizens that if they talk chat or txt or post about it they would be arrested.  

Let me ask you this,  why would that government quarantine 70 million people for the standard flu?  

Why would they be putting red notices on the doors of homes where people who have the coronavirus stating “Wuhan Infected” if it’s the standard flu?

1) BSL-4 Labs are incredibly secure and China had other nations assisting in setup for this lab. There is a decontamination point between the lab and the exit, and all work is done in positive pressure suits. It’s possible that a pathogen could escape, but improbable. This is standard for BSL-4 labs.

2) My only other critique is your comment about the fish market. It doesn’t matter how long it’s been in operation or how many pathogens have come out of it before, all it takes is **one** instance of a new virus with advantageous mutations jumping to humans. It is no less likely in an unsanitary fish market than any other dirty and crowded place, especially when you add in the copious wet markets in China. Viral mutations happen all the time.

Now, a point in your favor. *Lancet* found that the middle section of the virus’ genetic sequence is not related to any known Coronavirus. While it’s possible that this is a strain we have never encountered, it’s still interesting to note.

I am not alleging anything either way, just pointing some things out."

3 weeks sounds absolutely ridiculous, and quite frankly, flat out impossible. So I'm really curious to see what sources you're talking about. No vaccine will be approved for distribution before it goes through 2+ testing phases.

This virus is more contagious than any other pandemic virus in almost 100 years. SARS took 13 months to infect 8k people, this virus has done it in 7 weeks.

Now, odds are very low that this will happen, but keep in mind that the Spanish Flu wasn't very deadly at all until it mutated. Once it mutated it became extremely deadly and killed 20 to 50 million people. 

While the recent wave of mass immigration has had significant drawbacks for native Europeans, none of the bugs they brought with them are anywhere close to as dangerous as this flu pandemic.

2. Many countries do not allow foreigners to own land or real property. Condos are an exception - common in many Asian countries. 

3. Type of government and tying up capital in a foreign market - great for when it's inverse. But can potentially backfire tremendously. Hong Kong market is artificially limited because revenue is generated by land vs sales tax. 

4. FACTA - if you're a US citizen. Goes with number one. Enjoy that foreign reporting requirement. 😂

5. Lack of network, emerging countries struggles - lack of Infrastructure, uniformity of laws, etc. In the Philippines, if you prepay your taxes you get 25% discount. Most filipinos don't. If it's touristy, then you're on the whim on profiteering on seasonal demand which as.demonstrated by the new coronavirus can make revenue fall flat flights through China , cancelled. Chinese cities are hub cities, HK, Shanghai, Xiamen, Beijing. 

6. Ownership of property does.not mean you are automatically a resident. Foreigners can own land in Japan, but have to abide by immigration laws. Meanwhile in Philippines it is a requirement for a type of investment visa - 2 million minimum peso requirement in condo to get a non-immigrant visa. 

7. Rush to liquidate - money in other countries sometimes literally is cash in a bag. Not many people have liquidity to withdraw and transport with hired security unless it's a fire sale/ and then you're upside down. 

8. You're tied to that governments and it's people whim. Look how Chinese money is discussed around the world. With disdain. That's you now. 

9. Trusting a romantic partner that turns into financial disaster. I could go on, but a Reddit or Google search can show how fun/bad this can be. Especially if your name is on none of the paperwork, or - more fun due to graft and corruption ""even"" if it is.

However, global investors should pay attention. Mr Adachi is a renowned “reflationist” who favours massive monetary expansion. So his selection suggests that after two decades of eye-poppingly loose monetary policy, the BoJ is set to double down in 2020.

That is remarkable. Moreover, Japan is not alone. This week the Federal Reserve left US rates unchanged, after three cuts last year.

	The European Central Bank also remains set on an ultra loose course. So do most emerging market countries. Indeed, it is hard to find a central bank today with a tightening mission, other than the Swedes who raised rates from negative to zero in December.
  
Is this good news? Many investors might shout “yes”. 

Most asset prices have soared recently. 

“Very few people expected 12 months ago that we would see the returns we have seen in the markets in 2019,” Anne Richards, head of Fidelity International at the Davos Meeting of Global Elites.

In spite of this deluge of central bank petrol, recent growth has been far lower than economists might have expected with this much financial easing. “Why has the loosening of financial conditions not offset more of the growth slowdown?” BlackRock asked in a recent research note

Even as this super-loose policy causes asset prices to soar, it is destabilising the investment strategies of many mainstream investors, including pension funds and insurance companies. “The key question is, ‘how do you make money in an environment of negative rates?’” said Paco Ybarra, head of Markets at Citi Group, adding that falling rates and volatility have tipped the system into “a financial ice age”.

To compensate, mainstream investors are buying assets of longer duration, lower credit quality or in much riskier parts of the world. “We have to pick our risks,” said Ms Richards.

The Fed denies that this poses serious dangers to the financial system. But some financiers are becoming alarmed.

But here is the trillion-dollar rub: if a shock does occur — from the coronavirus or anything else — investors are likely to expect, even demand, even more central bank support. After all, when US repo markets gyrated last autumn, the Fed rushed to help. Mr Powell may have said he expects to slow down those repo interventions later this year, but few financiers believe this would occur if jitters re-emerged. Financiers expect the FED to intervene if any problem happens

1. Person who uses it exhales and creates a slight suction. This suction collects a ton of particles on the mask. Most masks won't be able to filter coronavirus out.

2. The material masks have are perfect habitat for viruses (moist, fibers causes friction that holds tight on particles people walk by on) and bacterias. The mask becomes a biological weapon.

Also masks don't protect you from airborne viruses, particles etc. that are only 125nm ""wide"" (2H2).

Masks work well when you are infected yourself. It stops you from coughing and sneezing virus particles all over the place and western countries do have a protocol for masks; infected people must wear masks and their beds must stay 1 meter away from eachother (in mass infection scenario).

Long story short: masks do more harm than good if you are not infected. Masks are suppose to be one time use and must be changed every 2-8h. There are of course real masks that can protect you from particles like 2H2 (125nm) but most of the masks will not. Also some of western countries are ready to use masks but they only use it on their own healthcare workers and infected so they wouldn't spread it to healthy patients aswell."

**from article, more in link**

A grey-haired man wearing a face mask lies dead on the pavement at ground zero of China's virus epidemic, a plastic shopping bag in one hand.
On what would typically be a crowded street in Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million under quarantine, there are only a few passersby and they dare not go near him.

AFP journalists saw the body on Thursday morning, not long before an emergency vehicle arrived carrying police and medical staff in full-body protective suits.
The man lay straight on his back in front of a closed furniture store. Medical staff in blue overalls gently shrouded his body with a blue blanket.

The ambulance left, and police stacked supermarket cardboard boxes to hide the scene.
AFP could not determine how the man, who appeared to be aged in his 60s, had died. AFP contacted police and local health officials afterwards but could not get details on his case.

But the reaction of the police and medical staff in hazmat suits, as well as some of the bystanders, highlighted the fear pervading the city.

A woman standing near the man, wearing pink pyjamas and a Mao cap, said she believed he had died from the virus.
It's terrible,"" she said. ""These days many people have died.""
Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market into humans.

The virus, which emerged late last year, has claimed at least 213 lives and infected thousands in China, with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone.
With the virus spreading to other countries, the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency.

The dead man on the street on Thursday lay one block from the Wuhan Number Six Hospital, one of the main medical centres for treating those with virus symptoms.
A team of forensic experts who examined him were immediately sprayed with disinfectant by colleagues after removing their hazardous material suits.

One man smoking near the scene was told sharply by police to put out his cigarette and don a face mask.
He quickly followed their orders.

In the two hours that AFP observed the scene, at least 15 ambulances passed by, attending other calls.
Finally, a white van with blacked-out windows arrived to take away the man.

The body was zipped into a yellow surgical bag, and carried into the van on a stretcher.

Staff immediately began to clean the ground as the van drove away, disinfecting the streets where the body had lain"

Those diseases take from some weeks to about 2 months in order to kill someone or be cured. So we have to wait 2 months and check those 10k people that are infected today and see if they are dead or cured in order to check the mortality rate. It’s like giving a knife to a kid and to an adult and let they fight with a wolf, the kids might die first and adults will fight longer, but we don’t know the victory rate until the fight ends.

People with weak immune system died first because they were in crowded hospitals (most of them died in Wuhan) and probably they took sometime to notice the disease since it was kinda new.
But you know about the disease and you will probably go to a hospital with more conditions to treat you. So they will give you medication to fight the symptoms (oxygen, drugs, antipyretic...) and to make your body stronger, so your body will have time to fight the virus.

Also, you probably won’t get coronavirus, but if you do, it will be in some months when the treatment will be more efficient."

As residents clamour for surgical masks in coronavirus-hit Hong Kong, 25,000 stolen from warehouse

Break-in at Yau Tong industrial building comes as worried residents queue outside pharmacies across the city for protective supplies


Thieves made off with 25,000 surgical masks from the stock of a Hong Kong businesswoman on Friday, as panicked residents stocked up on the face coverings amid fears of a local coronavirus outbreak.

The 25 boxes, containing 1,000 masks each, reached the city from Thailand on Wednesday and were stored in a warehouse at Wah Fai Industrial Building on Sze Shan Street, Yau Tong, intended for sale online.

The woman who runs the online store called police at about 5pm on Friday after discovering that they had disappeared.

Officers found no signs of a break-in at the site.

The theft came as Hongkongers queued overnight outside pharmacies across the city for masks, amid a shortfall as the number of people confirmed as infected with the deadly virus grew.

Thieves made off with 25,000 surgical masks from the stock of a Hong Kong businesswoman on Friday, as panicked residents stocked up on the face coverings amid fears of a local coronavirus outbreak.

The 25 boxes, containing 1,000 masks each, reached the city from Thailand on Wednesday and were stored in a warehouse at Wah Fai Industrial Building on Sze Shan Street, Yau Tong, intended for sale online.

The woman who runs the online store called police at about 5pm on Friday after discovering that they had disappeared.

Officers found no signs of a break-in at the site.

The theft came as Hongkongers queued overnight outside pharmacies across the city for masks, amid a shortfall as the number of people confirmed as infected with the deadly virus grew.


The businesswoman, 29, ordered 100 of the boxes – a total of 100,000 masks – from Thailand on the eve of Lunar New Year. The delivery arrived on Wednesday.

She said she had planned to sell the stock on e-commerce platform HKTVmall, at HK$80 (US$10) to HK$100 for a pack of 50. She said she hoped the people who stole them would not profiteer with them, but give them to those in need.

On Thursday, a 56-year-old worker at Princess Margaret Hospital was arrested on suspicion of stealing items from a ward, including 14 surgical masks, 22 N95 respirator masks and some surgical gloves."

I go to a school that has a lot of international Chinese students. I am currently taking a class on Chinese history and I would estimate that about 80% of the class is Asian (and I am making the assumption that most of those are Chinese).

Because Chinese New Year just occurred,
many of them visited China. I mentioned to one of my friends that I was a little worried about attending that class because it increases my chances of risk for coronavirus. My friend didn’t care, but I saw a similar post on here that makes me wonder what you guys think.

To me, it makes sense that being around a large group of people who have recently been to China is a logical worry, regardless of their race. And of course, international Chinese students are much more likely to visit than anyone else. I would compare this to gay people being excluded from donating blood: obviously not all of them have AIDS, but there is a higher chance of exposure for them.

Also, it’s not like this is an active worry for me. I said this in passing. I am not convinced every Chinese person will give me coronavirus.

I also think if you said Yes and genuinely planned to go, and the coronavirus was much more widespread and in Vietnam by summer, you'd have a good force majeure reason not to go.

I don't think mid range phones are the problem,but they're trying to make high end phones for a low price by cutting corners, rather than just designing a mid range phone.

They're also locked to Android, which doesn't play well on anything but these expensive phones. I think that's where there's room for the market to grow.

(For example, when Peter Parker lets that guy rob the crooked wrestling manager, and the robber kills Peter's uncle one second later - Peter's loss was his own fault, and even though he couldn't have foreseen that exact result, he cannot deny that his actions were selfish and that in fact the result makes sense.)

As such, what happens to the human race as a result of our neglectful, disrespectful and greedy treatment of creation is pure tragedy. No-one to blame but **US**, and what's worse is that, just like Peter's tragic outcome, our tragic outcome does not just cause _us_ to suffer, but those around us. Animals suffer. The earth becomes barren. Sons, daughters, siblings, friends, suffer as their loved ones die of heart disease, diabetes and now this new coronavirus.

Why and how are we so stupid and blind to the OBVIOUS connection between our actions and our suffering????!!!!!

There have been a few drastic changes to the map, and I will offer an explanation in case anyone's confused. 

First, the ""5-9"" stat has been removed. As the coronavirus continues to spread internationally, it has become rather redundant, and turning half the world orange over less than 10 cases may come across as alarmist.

Second, Alaska is once again coloured. In the next post I will make provincial-level maps in addition to this one for large countries (China, US, Canada, Russia, India and Australia). The purpose of this map is to show where the virus has spread on a global scale with respect to international borders. Separating Alaska and nowhere else seems out of place to me, so expect a more detailed breakdown in the future.

I realise this breaks the flow of the past submissions, but as I will continue to post maps in the coming weeks, it's best to do this sooner than later. I apologise for any confusion.

P1 is pretty much a dust mask and against pollen, P2 being the n95 range of protection with particles in the air and then there is P3. P3 would be the NBC rated masks meaning nuclear N, biological B, chemical C. A mask rated P2 is recommended currently for coronavirus as minimum protection but they have a chance of failure as it’s just that one filter and not air tight/covering the eyes/nose. 

Any P3 rated canister for your mask while get you as close as humanly possible to a 100% success rate. P2 masks like N95 or other disposable masks have a much larger degree of failure."

THIS is what my current hypothesis as to why China has been overwhelmed by this virus and would make sense as to why they have been closing off entire cities and rushing to build hospitals. This is a huge problem in the making. Whether the virus itself develops an ever higher mortality rate or not this has the definite potential to wipe out about 10% of the human population. There simply arent enough hospital beds to accommodate people. 

Currently the number of infected is growing at a rate of about 40% with no sign of stopping. About 5 days ago we where talking about 1,000 infected, today its over 10,000. Considering this has an incubation period of about 14 days and that a person can be Asymptomatic and yet transfer it it to others is problematic AF. Current projections puts the infected at over 100 million by the end of February if the current rate doesnt change."

It's costing China a lot of resources and is bad for their economy and general moral. Also has caused a lot of problems/increased hostility for Chinese outside of China. 

The timing of it coincided perfectly with Chinese new year celebrations which is ideal for it to spread. The release of the virus a few months early allowed it to grow to an ideal size under the radar until CNY. 

We've also seen that a certain world leader is pretty trigger happy and comfortable ordering questionable military action without consulting others. A chemical weapon scheme like this would be authorised from the  top and completely off the record.

""Of course we had nothing to do with it - everyone knows the Chinese eat random sh*t""

Starting a rumour that it started in a dodgy wildlife market is great - everyone sees it as a typical Chinese thing. Not to mention the fake pictures of the dodgy wildlife markets that were spread, which weren't even taken in China. 

It also wins environmentalists to the anti-China campaign (and being eco friendly is a big buzzword at the moment so it will resonate with a lot of people).

We have seen the Trump and Brexit movements gained popularity - through deep level manipulations on the population using social media etc. First the trade war. Then the Uighurs. Then the HK protests (why were they the biggest focus out of all the protesting countries?). Now this coronavirus.

I'd like to think I'm just being overly cynical and drawing a completely random conclusion, but what if I'm not? Is this far fetched?"

This is particularly concerning, because hospitals   Have a very limited number of ventilator machines on the best of days. If the need for ventilator support is as high as would be assumed from these ICU numbers, widespread infection could very quickly overwhelm hospitals’ resources, leading to a jump in lethality.

Treatment cost? No, it's not the US. They make significantly less in China. A 10k USD salary would have you at middle class.   
And the government doesn't pay any part of the treatment for ncov, unless the case has been tested and confirmed.   
There are test kits. Not specific to this exact coronavirus; but most illnesses and diseases work upon the existing methods. The one currently used for ncov is also used for a few std's.  
And I didn't say they were sending people who are about to die, home. They send people home regularly, when they have mild or moderate symptoms. However, when their health turns for the worse quickly, they are unable to walk back to the hospital. What would be the point even if they could walk there, when they were already refused before? (it's why you see so many videos of people laying in the street- the symptoms prevent them from being able to walk any decent distance).

You didn’t even quantify it with anything other then “if it’s not stopped” without even specifying what kind of timeframe you’re discussing or what the method to stop it is.

You also ignorantly or arrogantly failed to research SARS, which is also a Coronavirus. It disappeared. While some credit public health measures, scientists generally agree that still doesn’t explain the sudden disappearance of it. Why can’t this Coronavirus do the same? Where in your extrapolation do you factor this in?

Yet by your insane extrapolation method, SARS, which had a 9.6% fatality rate (currently higher than the current Coronavirus outbreak) should have wiped humanity out.

• In China it’s mostly because of higher pollution. (And now with the coronavirus outbreak, even more reasons to wear them).

• In Japan it’s because they have a strong sense of work duty. Because of that, people often wear protective masks when they go to work if they are feeling even a bit ill, but still able to work, so that they don’t contaminate others. That way, they contribute to the larger national economy while limiting others’ exposure to a disease.

Overall, it’s maximizing the work force. (They have a developed work-oriented mentality: “If you are still able to work, work. Also make sure others can work too, as it would be counteractive if you just went to work but made 10 others stay at home.”).

I won’t enter into details, but there is also the other edge of the sword: overexhaustion due to work. Which can lead even to death. The term in japanese is *karoshi*.

This Wuhan virus already overtook SARS, who cares about it, do you even know the genetic difference between SARS and corona? It's more than the difference between a pig and a human, or a rat and a human.

> While some credit public health measures, scientists generally agree  that still doesn’t explain the sudden disappearance of it. Why can’t  this Coronavirus do the same? Where in your extrapolation do you factor  this in? 

What are you even talking about? It disappeared because it stopped spreading, that's how viruses live. No host = no virus. If this Wuhan virus keeps spreading, it won't just die out. 

> Yet by your insane extrapolation method, SARS, which had a 9.6% fatality  rate (currently higher than the current Coronavirus outbreak) should  have wiped humanity out. 

First of all, SARS has a fatality rate of 15%, China downplayed it. No fucking way China had 10% while Hong Kong and Canada had both 15%.

Second of all, there's a study where they tracked 99 patients. 38 recovered, 11 died. That's at least 11% fatality rate. Who knows about the rest of the 50? Medical sources are saying the fatality rate is expected to be at around 15%, especially bad for old men that smoke.

You can't just call everything that provokes fear ""fear-mongering"" and discredit it, that's not how it works. Of course I'm fear-mongering, because it's a fucking scary topic.

No it hasn't, we are still seeing a [~28% increase in confirmed cases every day](https://ncov.r6.no/) and R0 values median have increased from 2.2 to 2.6 suggesting containment is becoming less effective. That also doesn't even get into how the rates of confirmed infected are really just measuring how fast we can test people at this point, suspect infections are well over 15k per the CCP official report and the lancet suggests it could be over 75k.

>    Fatality rate decrease (most are old people)

Again, not true, in Hubei the [confirmed case to mortality ratio is 3.5% and has been creeping up for days now.](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/01/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/) It is likely that we will see it increase slightly more once we have better data about cases in a few weeks.

>    We already had solution.

We do? I'm unaware of any finished vaccine, antivirals, or anything like that. There are some vaccines in trials, but that will take months to complete. 

>    Nothing to worry.

Yup, that's why the WHO declared an international health emergency since there is nothing to worry about 

If it infects 6x as many people as SARS it will kill more people than SARS did, and currently it is still actively spreading in the mainland. We have no idea how far this will spread and what the real mortality rate is. If the cases in any other countries break containment we could see pandemic levels of deaths and life long injuries. It is a serious matter that needs to be taken seriously. Most people on earth are safe for now, but that could change in less than a day if there are super spreading events. 

There is no need to panic, but to say this isn't concerning is dishonest and ill-informed."

The most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for the current coronavirus is via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the viral sequence is known and specific probes have already been designed to detect presence of viral RNA/DNA. 72 hours is plenty of time for PCR to be able to detect trace amounts of virus for people who are infected (despite being asymptomatic).

The created antibodies are then put into people along with the flu virus. Your body in turn learns to create the antibody and fight the virus. Therefore, there is a front line defence/treatment for influenza. There is NOTHING at all for SARS or any strain of coronavirus.

Anyway, this is more serious than what Americans believe.  Everyone I’ve talked to about this around work is just parroting the numbers from China because western MSM are parroting them.  Hook, line and sinker.  So when you’re just a headline, 30 second story reader it doesn’t look that serious.

This is why I was asking how many flu reports vs. coronavirus reports over the past year. There will likely be far more flu reports (I'm just guessing) because it's something that is reported on every year whereas the coronavirus is new. In a sense, it's kind of like looking at the hype for Cyberpunk 2077 and bemoaning the lack of news about Skyrim. Of course there's more news about Cyberpunk. Is it overhyped? Are people overreacting to the news surrounding Cyberpunk?

I would argue that we don't know yet. Maybe they are, but only time will tell. If the coronavirus sweeps across the world and you and I don't have masks (which would also have to prove effective) because they're all bought out, we'll look pretty silly arguing about whether people were overreacting. They weren't. We won't know, though, until then.

It's the same with sports. Lauding Pat Mahomes as the greatest quarterback (or saying he's overhyped) is foolish because we just don't know.

Now, recently the WHO has declared that the coronavirus is a global health emergency. I don't know what the qualifications are for a virus becoming that, but that seems pretty bad. 

I don't personally know anyone who has bought masks, though I do work in a hospital. Perhaps the people here are better informed. 

Finally, we have to assess some of the instances you've brought up. When 9/11 occurred everyone went out and filled up their gas tank. Looking back, it was certainly an odd reaction. At least buying face masks makes a bit more sense, but people may not be buying them solely for personal use. People buy up extra items (gaming consoles, for example) in order to sell them for a higher price due to lack of availability. It could be the same with the masks. Avoiding large gatherings is probably smart if you want to avoid getting sick just generally, so if it doesn't cost anything (unlike the masks) why not do that too? It's a philosophy of better safe than sorry. 

The other problem you have when it comes to how people are reacting is confirmation bias. I'm assuming we're talking about all people everywhere (or at least North America). If so, how many people aren't doing these things? Is it more or less than the number of people that are? How many people doing these things equates to an 'overreaction'?

Given a specific time, place, person(s), we could probably agree on whether those people are overreacting, but everyone? We're all overreacting? Or the average of reaction is over what it ought to be? I doubt you can answer those questions and have anyone agree right now. Give it a decade and you can probably get closer to the truth."

And we know that two of the scientists working at the Wuhan BSL-4 Lab (Xing-Yi Ge and Zhengli-Li Shi) had previously worked on a project where they successfully combined a novel coronavirus found in bats with SARS in order to make the a “chimera virus” that was able to infect humans, details of this study can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985)"

Even if coronavirus doesn't kill thousands, it could still be serious enough to put our already burdened health care system under even more stress. Besides, of all the cases requiring hospitalization, 11 percent of patients have died, this is much higher than the flu.

Las víctimas mortales alcanzan este viernes las 213 personas, según los datos oficiales. El [coronavirus](//elpais.com/tag/ncov/a/) 2019-nCoV puede provocar neumonía con síntomas como fiebre alta, tos seca, dolor de cabeza y dificultad para respirar. Su periodo de incubación medio es de tres a siete días, con un máximo de 14. Los científicos chinos han confirmado que, a diferencia del SARS, es posible el contagio durante la incubación. [La OMS ha declarado una emergencia internacional por el brote.](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/30/actualidad/1580399024_626205.html)

 Los casos sospechosos se elevan ya a 15.238, según la Comisión Nacional de Sanidad, mientras que 171 enfermos han conseguido recuperarse. Se mantiene en observación a 102.427 personas que han estado en contacto con infectados.

 La mayor parte de los fallecidos, el 90%, procede de la provincia de Hubei, donde se encuentra la ciudad de Wuhan y [foco de la epidemia](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/23/actualidad/1579783625_021253.html?rel=lom). En las últimas 24 horas, en las que se han registrado 43 muertes, todas menos una correspondían a esta provincia.

 ### España no impondrá restricciones de viaje ni de comercio

 España ya está aplicando ""casi todo lo que dice la OMS"", organismo que este jueves declaró la emergencia internacional por la expansión del [coronavirus](//elpais.com/tag/coronavirus/a). El director del Centro de Coordinación de Alertas y Emergencias Sanitarias del Ministerio de Sanidad, Fernando Simón, ha explicado este viernes a la prensa que estas medidas no son sustancialmente distintas a lo que recomendó la OMS hace una semana, y que no incluyen ni restricciones de viaje ni de comercio, informa **Pablo Linde.**

 ""No esperamos que en España se produzca más que algún caso importado. No creemos que se vayan a producir transmisiones aquí, pero nos estamos preparando para ese escenario"", ha afirmado Simón. El director del Centro de Coordinación de Alertas y Emergencias Sanitarias se ha mostrado sorprendido con la declaración del estado de emergencia en Italia. ""No es el consenso de la UE y en España por el momento no se plantea"", ha asegurado.

 Con los datos preliminares, ""los indicios son que la enfermedad no es excesivamente transmisible. Solo se transmite de forma comunitaria en una zona y parece que la epidemia tiene posibilidades de comenzar a remitir pronto"", ha afirmado. La zona de transmisión es solo Hubei, la provincia de China donde se encuentra Wuhan. ""Hay provincias chinas con menos casos que otros países. Sería incoherente recomendar no viajar a todo el país"", ha opinado.

 Simón ha explicado que tres médicos y una enfermera acompañarán a los españoles evacuados desde Wuhan en su vuelo, que despegó esta madrugada de la ciudad china. Los ciudadanos de países nórdicos que viajan a bordo serán llevados a sus países de origen nada más aterrizar en el aeropuerto de Torrejón de Ardoz, en España.

 ### Italia declara el estado de emergencia por el coronavirus

 El Consejo de Ministros italiano ha aprobado este viernes un decreto por el que declara el estado de emergencia por el coronavirus, [tras la decisión de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de decretar la emergencia global](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/30/actualidad/1580399024_626205.html). ""Se trata simplemente de tomar nota de la decisión de la OMS"", han dicho fuentes gubernamentales italianas. El Gobierno ha asignado cinco millones de euros iniciales para hacer frente a la expansión del virus. El ministro de Salud, Roberto Speranza, ha explicado que son medidas de precaución, y que a la luz de la declaración de emergencia internacional se han activado los instrumentos reglamentarios para estos casos.

 Italia ya declaró el estado de emergencia sanitaria cuando se registró la epidemia del SARS en 2002. Este mecanismo, utilizado por ejemplo después de terremotos o inundaciones como las de Venecia, permite activar fondos y movilizar a organismos, como la protección civil, con el fin de preparar estructuras de acogida de personas.

 El primer ministro italiano, Guiseppe Conte, [confirmó este jueves dos casos de coronavirus,](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/30/actualidad/1580421011_237337.html) que afectan a dos turistas chinos que llegaron al país en enero. Como medida de precaución, las autoridades de Italia han decidido cancelar las conexiones aéreas con China para evitar la propagación del brote. También este jueves, 6.000 pasajeros estuvieron bloqueados a bordo de un crucero en el puerto romano de Civitavecchia en el que había una pareja que presentaba síntomas compatibles con el coronavirus. Finalmente, tras confirmarse los resultados negativos de los análisis, el pasaje puedo desembarcar.

 ### Reino Unido confirma los dos primeros casos

 ""Podemos confirmar que dos pacientes en Inglaterra, miembros de la misma familia, han dado positivo"", ha anunciado el jefe de los servicios médicos ingleses, Chris Whitty, en un comunicado difundido por el Ministerio de Salud, en el que no han dado más detalles sobre los afectados para preservar su privacidad. Fuera de China, la epidemia se ha extendido a una veintena de países, que acumulan en torno a los 130 casos.

 Los dos afectados en Inglaterra ""están recibiendo cuidados especializados de los servicios sanitarios"" y se están empleando ""procedimientos de control de infecciones a fin de prevenir que el virus se propague"", según Whitty.

 Los expertos médicos británicos ya habían alertado de que era ""altamente probable"" que se registraran casos de coronavirus en Reino Unido. ""El Servicio Nacional de Salud está extremadamente bien preparado y habituado a gestionar infecciones y estamos ya trabajando rápidamente para identificar a cualquiera que haya entrado en contacto con los pacientes para prevenir una mayor expansión"", ha añadido Whitty.

 Tailandia, el país con más afectados después de China, con 19 casos, ha confirmado el primer contagio directo entre humanos producido dentro del país. También India ha confirmado su primer positivo, informa **Ángel Martínez.** Se trata de una estudiante india procedente de Wuhan,que llevaba una semana en un pabellón de aislamiento en el distrito de Thrissur, en el estado sureño de Kerala. Rusia también ha anunciado este viernes los dos primeros casos confirmados.

 ### Evacuaciones en marcha y prohibiciones de viaje

 Mientras que ya ha aterrizado en la base aérea británica de Brize Norton [el avión fletado por el Gobierno británico que transporta a sus ciudadanos y la veintena de españoles evacuados](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/30/actualidad/1580397557_622969.html?rel=lom), otros países continúan la repatriación de sus nacionales.

 El avión militar con los primeros 180 franceses repatriados de Wuhan aterrizó este viernes al mediodía en la base aérea de Istres, en el sur de Francia, informa **Silvia Ayuso**. Aunque antes de despegar desde la ciudad china habían dado negativo en las pruebas del coronavirus 2019-nCoV, uno de los pasajeros presentó durante el vuelo síntomas y fue llevado de inmediato al hospital marsellés de Timone, anunció la ministra de Salud, Agnès Buzyn, que acudió a recibir a los repatriados. Los demás fueron trasladados a un centro de vacaciones en Carry-le-Rouet, una localidad en la costa mediterránea a 30 kilómetros Marsella, donde deberán pasar los próximos 14 días en cuarentena.

 El recinto cumple los requisitos que habían impuesto las autoridades al buscar un lugar donde acoger a los repatriados: “Un criterio ante todo sanitario con habitaciones aisladas, que también esté cerca de un hospital y, además, que sea agradable y cálido. El centro de vacaciones de Carry-le-Rouet respondía a todos esos criterios”, explicó Buzyn. Aunque los repatriados, que deberán someterse dos veces al día a pruebas para verificar que no presentan síntomas, podrán moverse libremente por el recinto, no podrán abandonarlo —varios gendarmes apostados en el exterior velarán por que nadie salga ni entre sin permiso— y deberán portar máscaras cuando estén en zonas comunes. Además, dijo la ministra, aunque podrán recibir paquetes, no se permitirá la visita de familiares. Más de medio centenar de profesionales de la salud se turnarán durante las próximas dos semanas para acompañar y supervisar a los ciudadanos repatriados, a los que en los próximos días se podría unir un nuevo contingente, ya que según anunció la Comisión Europea, está previsto que se flete un nuevo avión para trasladar a otros ciudadanos franceses que deseen partir de Wuhan, así como a otros extranjeros que también puedan hacerlo, en principio sobre todo europeos.

 En París, el Instituto Pasteur anunció este viernes por su parte que ha conseguido aislar las cepas del coronavirus detectado en Francia y ha constituido un grupo de trabajo para buscar posibles soluciones, entre ellas una vacuna que podría estar disponible en 20 meses. Según explicó su director científico, Christophe d’Enfert, la idea es trabajar sobre una modificación de la vacuna contra el sarampión. “Hemos desarrollado una plataforma que en ocho meses nos permitirá obtener un virus atenuado que podamos probar en animales”, explicó. “Si todo va bien”, subrayó, a finales de agosto se podría entrar en la fase clínica, agregó. Tomando como modelo el trabajo realizado sobre el ébola, dijo, esta debería durar un año y, de nuevo “si todo va bien”, se podría disponer de una vac"

Even if we assume the OP is here to spread propaganda (something I honestly don't believe) the evidence suggests that we come to the same conclusion whether we believe him or not. The Chinese  government is doing a good job addressing this virus in terms of containment, treatment, and international transparency.

I think you and many others simply have a preconceived hypothesis about the Chinese government, and I think you actively seek information that would confirm that hypothesis. Surely there are plenty of areas that you will find that ammunition, but  the response to the coronavirus is not one of them at this time. Of course, you are welcome to wait with baited breath in the coming weeks to jump on an opportunity to criticize them for their Coronavirus response should that change.

Personally, I would rather criticize them for the things that they actually need to address rather than for the areas they are doing well in. Otherwise, I would like like an asshole who just wants to find a reason to criticize a country."

Even if there is a vaccine you would still be at risk. A vaccine simply teachers your body how to fight against it, doesn't necessarily mean you are immune to it. 

It is impossible to cure a virus. You can't give antibodies to fight it like a bacterial infection. You can however treat the symptoms in order to make the person more comfortable.

Viruses can't ""die off"" because they are not alive in the first place. 

Everything up to this point I am 99% sure what I provided is accurate. 

Onto the second part I am not 100% sure but will answer to the best I can. 

First of all, it is unlikely it was engineered in my opinion. Coronavirus already existed so the theory it jumped from an animal to a human makes more sense. 

That being said if it was created then I guess hypothetically the creators could know the effects of later generations but **I THINK** that it would be difficult to guess how it would mutate. If it was engineered then it's not outside of the realm of possibility that they could make different variations that would behave differently. 

**I THINK* that mutations are just so random that it's unlikely that the creator would be able to predict how it would mutate."

>British health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that “anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.” The measures are a step up from those during the devastating 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, when returning travelers from West Africa were asked to monitor themselves for symptoms.

>Mark Woolhouse, **a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh**, said the steps are justified to prevent the introduction of the virus and its spread.

Most respiratory viruses use ICAM1 cell surface molecules to bind to and invade our respiratory tracts. Unfortunately at high altitudes such as mountains or planes our expression of ICAM1 is much higher than normal. This means inhaling viral particles will be much more likely to result in effective infection.

I don't know if novel coronavirus is ICAM1 mediated but you're certainly much much more likely to get a cold or flu on a plane. Recycling and filtering the air would have to have incredibly fine filters to remove viruses, but more importantly if you're sitting near an infected person the air isn't going to be recycled before it gets to you.


According to my virology lecturer however drinking alcohol reduces ICAM1 expression and may reduce your chances of getting an infection, so a plane beer might be a good idea for OP."

Globalmente, ogni anno, il virus influenzale colpisce tra il 5 e il 15% della popolazione adulta (vale a dire da 350 milioni a 1 miliardo di persone), un’incidenza che sale al 20-30% nei bambini.

 

Tra i 3 e i 5 milioni di casi di influenza riportati annualmente evolvono in complicanze che causano il decesso in circa il 10% dei casi (vale a dire da 250 a 500 mila persone), soprattutto tra i gruppi di popolazione a rischio (bambini sotto i 5 anni, anziani e persone affette da malattie croniche).




https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/2019-nCoV

Casi confermati: 7824

Decessi: 170

Let's do the math: siamo al 2%, per ora




Ora, not a doctor here, ma sono un appassionato, mio padre è un medico, la mia compagna è un medico. Ovviamente se n'è discusso visto questo allarmismo.

Beh che dire, se ci fate un giro sui siti dell'ISS o OMS non c'è scritto di andare nel panico e c'è scritto semplicemente di applicare le normali norme igieniche: lavarsi le mani (spesso, dopo aver tossito o starnutito, dopo essere stati in giro), non sputare, usare fazzoletti usa e getta, non starnutire e tossire addosso alla gente... Cioè... Le basi...

Non vedo motivo di fare allarmismo... Una persona immunocompetente dovrebbe essere in grado di contrastare la cosa + eventualmente una cura sintomatica. Mi preoccuperei di più per chi è immunodeficiente, ma in tal caso la preoccupazione vale anche per l'influenza e qualsiasi altra cosa.

Sicuro ci sta chi mi caga i maroni sotto a sto commento per cui non risponderò.

China has reported nearly 10,000 cases and 213 deaths, but the virus has spread to 18 countries, mostly, presumably, by airline passengers.

The United States has advised its citizens not to travel to China, raising its warning to the same level as those for Iraq and Afghanistan.

U.S. airlines, which have been reducing flights to China this week, were reassessing flying plans as a result, according to people familiar with the matter.

It is possible the White House could opt to take further action to bar flights to China in coming days, but officials stressed that no decision has been made.

The Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents American Airlines pilots, cited “serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus” in a lawsuit filed in Texas, where the airline is based.

American said it was taking precautions against the virus but had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. On Wednesday, it announced flight cancellations from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai, but is continuing flights from Dallas."

To put it this way, NZ is less than 1% of the global economy. $205 billion out of $84 Trillion. So by overweighting with NZ shares and under weighting globally you're basically relying on NZ out performing the rest of the world. Put simply, it's not very diverse and much higher risk. NZ economy depends on a lot of primary industry exports and tourism. All it takes is a natural disaster (which NZ has shown it's very susceptible to) or our own Coronavirus-esque event and we could be significantly affected and isolated. I personally prefer not to bank on NZ out performing the rest of the world. 

Vanguard is very diverse and covers the markets I want to back at a very low cost. For me keeping it simple is easier to manage and also cheaper fee wise. We all know fees are a significant slice of long-term gain so this is important to factor in. 

Since I am mid-20s and have a 25+ year time frame for investment I can handle a recession so I'm not concerned about having bonds in my portfolio at this stage. The global markets have always proven to recover as far as records show.

Also, inadvertently I do hold a small amount of NZ shares because I contribute my minimum requirement to kiwisaver to get the maximum member tax credits. My KS is with Simplicity growth. This proportion is probably still larger than NZs global GDP percentage! But it means I do have a small 'hometown' bias. Hope this helps."

However the nCov one really stands out because of racism and the ""China bad"" narrative. Now not all memes about the coronavirus are exactly racist, but the bulk of them are. The ones that are not racist are either ironic or just plain stupid, or hilarious but in a stupid kind of way (ie the memes asking Corona beer to sue the virus).

Now, needless to say the nCov by itself is no laughing matter. Two week incubation and a death toll jumping from 100 to 170 in a couple of days is scary shit."

Usually 10-20% of the air you breath is not filtered. Surgical masks are inferior to N95, N99 and P100 masks  This short video covers it pretty well  [https://youtu.be/JR2uLfEVD2w](https://youtu.be/JR2uLfEVD2w)

 Used masks should be replaced but I understand you have no other options and masks are pretty much sold out. I use P100 respirators but I understand your position . Personally I would hold onto your N95 masks over a 1 ply. I wouldn’t use alcohol or lysol as it can reduce or eliminate the electrostatic charges on N95 Masks/Respirators 

Everything below is in regards to N95 and N99 and P100 particulate respirators and masks. Not the entire Respirator Assembly. Just the actual filter or soft flexible filter masks. Not special respirator filters that use activated carbon. VOC or ACID protection masks. Heating those up can reduce or damage the ability to remove, VOC’s ozone, oils, acids etc,.. 

Masks with blood on them, torn or damaged are considered beyond help.

Modern N95  respirators (particulate respirators) use filtering media and also electrostatic charged particles to capture smaller particles by electrostatic attraction. interception, and diffusion. Studies have shown that alcohol and lysol reduce the electrostatic properties and reduce the masks ability to work properly. 

It’s important for a mask to keep it’s electrostatic properties as the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is .125 microns in size and much smaller than the actual filtering media. 

Obviously a damaged mask is better than no mask at all. I know of a few ways to kill of the coronavirus. UV-C light but it would take a full chapter to explain how and you probably don’t have the light to do it.

Heat works but you have to be very careful to reach the proper temperature while not getting the respirator so hot as to melt it or damage the strength of the fibers. Studies have shown that heating the Coronavirus to 150F or 56C for 15 minutes will kill it off. 

The safest and easiest way to kill off the coronavirus is to put your N95’s in a food dehydrator for 30 minutes. Most can be set at 155F to 165F but most people don’t have one.

If you have an oven that can drop the temperature to 160F. Most ovens won’t heat below 180F. You could preheat the oven to 180F. Wrap the N95 mask in aluminum foil place it in the center of an oven making sure it’s not near any heating elements and heat it for 30 minutes.  The aluminum helps keep the mask clean and prevents hot spots inside.  Aluminum foil is not mandatory but a good Idea as ovens are not clean environments. Some problems you could run into are getting the mask too hot and damaging or melting the rubber strap.

Autoclaves run 121C or 250F are too hot and will cause damage to the mask and the  electrostatic properties to some degree.

Here are a list of articles covering all types of Disinfecting  masks and Respirators. The 155-165 F food dehydrator or 160-180 Oven way will probably be your only options.

China has so many lives at stake yet we decide to focus on 2 lives when thousands even millions could die, people don’t like to see the bigger problems at times since they are worried of what could happen so they try to push it aside but in doing so the problem only grows worse, Kobe would want us to worry about the bigger picture. People are already talking about WW3 and there’s also a coronavirus now too, what’s the point in war when there’s a disease killing? Honestly war isn’t the problem here but people just don’t see it, they think war will solve the problem, it worked last 2 times right? We had hitler like he was TOTALLY a good guy am I right?... so many people died from WW1 and 2 the families, the people without homes even the small towns had to deal with it.

But if the US wants to in the future kill off China's population using a genetically engineered virus that only targets ethnically Chinese people, then this outbreak is fortuitous indeed.

Caronavirus is a PSYOP by US to get us to accept that a future ENGINEERED virus that targets only asian people was created by the Chinese Government.

Think about it, if the US wipes out say 3/4 quarters of Chinese population then China will nolonger be a bigger economy/superpower.

Not only that, they'll be desperate for immigration.

Question: is it possible to create viruses that only kill Chinese?

Answer: 
>In October 2003, Tong Zeng, a Chinese lawyer and a volunteer in a 1998 Chinese-American medical cooperation program, published a book[16] that again speculated that SARS could be a biological weapon developed by the United States against China. In the book, Tong disclosed that in the 1990s, many American research groups collected thousands of blood and DNA samples and specimens of mainland Chinese (including 5,000 DNA samples from twins) through numerous joint research projects carried out in China. These samples were then sent back to the United States for further research and could be used in developing biological weapons targeting Chinese. These samples came from 22 provinces in China, all of which were hit by SARS in 2003. Only provinces like Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan, Tibet, and Xinjiang were left out, and all these provinces suffered less severely during the SARS outbreak.

Question: has the Caronavirus killed any non ethnically Chinese people? What about non asian people? Note I am stressing **killed** and not just infected.

Answer: don't know, let us know in comments if you do know.

The article linked details the history of the Pentagon/DARPA in developing racial bio weapons."

What if he’s waiting for other countries to collapse then lowkey cure his own people first, and then offer the antidote to other countries at a high price or whatever he does best to dictate.
Why? Because Xi Jinping is a communist who doesn’t give a damn about human rights but his wellbeing so for this outbreak to occur, means nothing to him."

I also think it’s you misreading the post. Her claim that she had ‘a coronavirus’ and it’s nothing to worry about shows a complete lack of understanding the concept of a brand new strain that is spreading at a huge rate.

If ‘a coronavirus’ had her in the hospital, then she is on the list of the people that really need to watch what’s happening and take precautions in the event of an outbreak near her. Bad science and bad information is one of the biggest issues on Instagram and the like, potentially putting people in danger.

I currently live in the Philippines and there are currently a few confirmed cases of the Coronavirus here. My mother is very paranoid and is currently forcing me to stay home because of it so I had to cancel a lot of plans last minute.

I tried reasoning with her saying ""It's not as bad as you're making out to be, it's not the black plague"" or ""If it's that bad then why am I allowed to go to school?"" etc. She then calls me selfish for wanting to go out, that I don't care about my health and such.

I really appreciate that she's concerned and all, but I just think that all of this is a bit too far

AITA?

“Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan,” the U.S. State Department said in a new travel advisory on its website, raising the warning for China to the same level as Afghanistan and Iraq.

As well, Japan openly denies much of their own racist history and students rarely learn even 1/10th of their country's massacres. Being good at math and physics does not help in this area.

Also, they are openly xenophobic. There are apartments, motels, spas, etc. which openly say foreigners are not allowed there unless a Japanese person accompanies them. This is also true in other countries through Asia.

In some places it isn't because of low immigration rates, either. A lot of it can also be because of media. A good example of this is how the media is treating the coronavirus. Look at how it is treated in America media versus Japan, Philippines, Thailand, etc. It is vastly different. The American articles, at least the ones I have read in Washington Post, CNN, and others, do not list names or citizenship. They always say ""American resident"" or ""college student"", something of this nature. If you look at the other countries, the first thing they list is ""Chinese national"". That alone creates fear and racism, but that is just one example. If you look at other more common articles such as murder, rape, etc. the same thing happens. They will *always* list that it is a foreigner who did something, whereas the American articles often leave it out (except for places like Fox News, Washington Examiner, Breitbart, etc). And you better believe that Fox News, etc. list the name and country of origin for a specific reason."

> SINGAPORE - All travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days, as well as anyone with a China passport, will be barred from entry or transit in Singapore, as the nation ramps up measures to keep the Wuhan virus at bay.

> The new measures will kick in at 11.59pm on Saturday (Feb 1).

> Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass holders can return, subject to a leave of absence of 14 days, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong on Friday (Jan 31).

> ""On top of everything we've already introduced, this will enable us to limit the number of new imported cases here and reduce risk of community spread in Singapore,"" he said at a press conference on Friday.

> ""The situation remains fluid, it's constantly changing, and we do not rule out taking further measures,"" added Mr Wong, who is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force tackling the spread of the Wuhan virus here.

> The tough new measures come on the heels of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) announcement on Thursday that the coronavirus epidemic in China now constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

> The virus has now infected over 9,000 people - surpassing Sars which had over 8,000 infections. It has killed over 200, with China's Wuhan city at the epicentre of the crisis.

> There is no community spread of Wuhan virus within Singapore, Mr Wong stressed, and the authorities are doing everything possible to reduce the risk of this happening.

> Limiting the number of new imported cases here is a key part of this effort.

> Related Story Wuhan virus: Get latest updates

> As of Thursday, 13 people had tested positive for the virus in Singapore. All were travellers from Wuhan.

> The authorities will suspend issuing visas to those with China passports with immediate effect.

> Appeals will be looked at on a case-by-case basis, for instance, if a person holding a China passport has been living elsewhere.

> Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officers will also check the travel history of travellers to ensure they have not been in China in 14 days. If so, they will be prevented from entering Singapore.

> The WHO believes that it is still possible to interrupt the spread of the virus, provided that countries put in place strong preparedness and response measures, and there has been increased action worldwide to limit global spread by restricting the entry of possible contacts and cases into other countries.

Alors que depuis début 2019 elle avait fait preuve de résistance, comparée à l'ensemble de la zone euro, la croissance a flanché en fin d'année. Selon les premières estimations publiées ce vendredi matin par l'Insee, le PIB a en effet reculé de 0,1 % au quatrième trimestre 2019, après avoir enregistré une hausse de 0,3 % au cours des premier et troisième trimestres et de 0,4 % au printemps. C'est le premier recul trimestriel du PIB depuis le printemps 2016.

C'est également bien moins que le +0,3 % qu'anticipait l'Insee dans sa dernière note de conjoncture. Les statisticiens publics comptaient sur la bonne tenue des exportations et une consommation bien orientée. Mais le chiffre annoncé ce vendredi est également bien inférieur au consensus des économistes, qui tablaient sur une hausse de 0,2 % du PIB.

Un « ralentissement passager », selon le Maire

Conséquence directe de cette contre-performance : en moyenne sur l'année, la croissance française atteint 1,2 %, après +1,7 % en 2018. Soit moins que ce qu'anticipaient, il y a quelques semaines encore, les statisticiens publics.  L'honneur est cependant sauf pour Bercy, puisqu'en dépit du coup de frein de l'hiver, la croissance française devrait rester supérieure à celle de la zone euro. La Commission européenne table en effet sur une hausse du PIB de 1,1 %.

Pour autant, ces chiffres n'augurent pas que de bonnes choses pour l'année en cours. Avec cette contre-performance, l'acquis de croissance (c'est-à-dire le niveau que le PIB atteindrait si l'activité restait étale d'ici au 31 décembre) n'est que de 0,16 %. Ce qui veut dire que pour atteindre le niveau de 1,3 % envisagé par la Loi de finances pour 2020, il faudrait que le PIB progresse de 0,45 % à chaque trimestre. Un niveau nettement supérieur à celui qui a été de règle ces dernières années.

Malgré tout, l'heure n'est surtout pas à la déprime au sein du gouvernement. Peu après la publication des chiffres de l'Insee, Bruno Le Maire a en effet estimé, dans un communiqué, qu'il s'agissait avant tout d'un « ralentissement passager » et que celui-ci ne « remet donc pas en cause les fondamentaux de la croissance française qui sont solides ». Et d'insister : « La consommation des ménages et les investissements des entreprises résistent. »

Ralentissement généralisé

De fait, si effectivement consommation et investissement ne plongent pas, les données publiées montrent que toutes les composantes de l'économie décélèrent sur le trimestre mais progressent sur l'ensemble de l'année. Les dépenses de consommation des ménages progressent de 0,2 %, soit un rythme moindre que le +0,4 % du trimestre précédent.

Un ralentissement qui touche aussi bien les achats de biens, particulièrement touchés en décembre selon les professionnels que ceux de services. « La consommation de services de transport recule nettement (-2,0 %) en lien avec les mouvements sociaux d'octobre et décembre 2019 », souligne l'Insee dans la seule allusion à la contestation contre la réforme des retraites.

Pour autant, en « moyenne sur l'année, la consommation des ménages accélère légèrement en 2019 », souligne l'Insee. Elle augmente en effet de 1,2 %, après +0,9 % en 2018.

Dans le même temps, la décélération de l'investissement total au quatrième trimestre est plus marquée, avec une hausse limitée de 0,3 %, après +1,3 % à l'automne. La déprime de l'investissement est particulièrement forte pour les entreprises privées (+0,3 %, après 1,6 %). « Au total, la demande intérieure finale hors stocks ralentit par rapport au trimestre précédent », souligne l'Insee.

Et sur l'ensemble de 2019, l'investissement total « accélère vivement », selon l'Insee : +3,6 % après +2,8 %.

Impact négatif du commerce extérieur

Enfin, de son côté et sur le seul quatrième trimestre, le commerce extérieur n'a pas d'effet sur l'activité. Ni en positif, ni en négatif.

Mais sur l'ensemble de l'année, c'est tout autre chose. Il a en effet pénalisé la croissance, du fait de la forte augmentation des importations (+2,3 %, après +1,2 % en 2018) et du ralentissement des exportations (+1,8 % après +3,5 % en 2018) dans un contexte international morose du fait, notamment, de la guerre commerciale entre Washington et Pékin .

Un contexte difficile qui a conduit à limiter les stocks

Reste les stocks. « Au quatrième trimestre 2019, les variations de stocks contribuent négativement à la croissance du PIB (-0,4 point après -0,1 point), en particulier dans les matériels de transport et les biens d'équipement », souligne l'Insee. Un comportement qui n'est pas si surprenant : les incertitudes liées tant à la situation nationale (grèves en fin d'année) qu'internationales avec la guerre commerciale americano-chinoise ont sans doute incité les chefs d'entreprise à réduire leurs stocks et donc à moins produire, mais aussi à repousser certains investissements.

Un mouvement de balancier inverse pourrait se faire sentir au premier trimestre de cette année et doper un peu le PIB. Sauf si d'autres facteurs, et notamment les retombées économiques du coronavirus chinois, venaient à nouveau assombrir l'horizon."

1. Added the much-requested Death/Infection chart.

2. Improved the data source. Previously I only used Wikipedia as an easy source. Data is now from the National Health Commission of PRC (before 21 Jan) and the Word Health Organization (which only started publishing situation reports starting from 21 Jan).

3. I’m using the first officially recorded confirmed infection as day 1. If you know of better records than the NHC and WHO have, I can add them to the dataset. I’m not aware of any good way to simulate data prior to the first official record.

4. I also can’t do any magic to account for hidden cases, information suppression, CNY migration, weather, flu seasons, globalization or lag factors. If only there was a magic formula to add to the equation.

5. Some people have commented that the 2019-nCoV infection/death trend may be similar to the common flu. This may well be so but I don’t make any claims whether it is or isn’t. If you could point me to where I can get data for the common flu, I’d gladly make a chart for it since I’m curious myself.

The HK government and CCP have only lost more and more of our hearts as time has gone on.

A few months ago, I was firmly in the camp of discouraging HK independence, because I still had faith that the CCP and Carrie Lam would be able to resolve things by listening to the people. But given how things have turned out, I’m willing to see where this new direction could take HK. When our SAR government is unable to take decisive action to solve our problems, especially during this coronavirus epidemic, it’s clear that there are greater benefits to being able to call our own shots than to defer to the Central Government in times like these.

It’s not discriminatory towards mainlanders, and it’s not elitist, to want to dictate our own affairs. I also don’t believe that because the majority of HKers are ethnically Chinese, or because we consume food, water, or electricity from the mainland, we are automatically obligated to be thankful towards the PRC, that we must identify ourselves as being a part of the country. We pay a king’s ransom for Dongjiang water, so it’s not charity that we need to be thankful for. It’s an import deal that was made out of expediency. Hong Kong imports a lot of beef from Brazil, does that mean we’re obligated to love Brazil and identify as Brazilian, and if we don’t, we’re traitors? No we aren’t.

So let’s see. Regimes rise and fall all the time, and to not be mentally prepared for the possibility of independence would be foolish, even if one is ok with staying with China. But yes, independence is not one of the Five Demands, and if we did get all 5 of them, we might not even need to fight for independence if we can elect our own strong leaders."

Standard flu has a mortality rate of 0.13%, thus far the new Coronavirus is around 6%.  That’s roughly 4500% more dangerous than the average flu.  And it’s early, the mortality rate is expected to rise.  Other viruses in the category (SARS and MERS had 15% and 34% mortality rates).

The media could scare everyone far more, they just are clueless on the details.  But with something this contagious (exponentially more contagious than SARS or MERS), it relies on crowded areas/poor hygiene for survival.  China is about the worst place it could break out with the massive/dense/many times unsanitary population centers.

China is going to have a dismal few quarters, this thing is just getting started.  Not as lethal as previous two epidemics, but still very deadly and seemingly far more contagious.

Expect long quarantines into possibly early summer in much of China.  All that being said, it’s a good opportunity to ride the waves of news with options.  Market seems to overreact to Asian markets at open, then rise.  Trend is developing."

Keep physical record of your own vitals, especially temperature, and check if you feel better over time.

I think it’s quite funny how much china have kicked & screamed when the Chinese people, as well as outsiders have wanted them to shut down the live wild animal food trade, they’ve sooked about it being their ‘cultural heritage’ and part of their beliefs. But all it took was 130 deaths for them to ban it entirely - all in all, not the worst thing that could have happened. 
If this strain of the coronavirus actually means they’ll ban the practice permanently (you’d think they’d have learnt from SARS but clearly not, so I doubt they will learn from this) then I honestly will take it as a win!! 

Being in the Southern Hemisphere, it’s really scary to see the hold China has & how manipulative their tactic are, they basically own so many of the islands now because of unneeded investments in things like giant ports & hotels - all of which only suit chinas needs, not the islands.

> SINGAPORE - All travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days, as well as anyone with a China passport, will be barred from entry or transit in Singapore, as the nation ramps up measures to keep the Wuhan virus at bay.

> The new measures will kick in at 11.59pm on Saturday (Feb 1).

> Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term-pass holders can return, subject to a leave of absence of 14 days, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong on Friday (Jan 31).

> ""On top of everything we've already introduced, this will enable us to limit the number of new imported cases here and reduce risk of community spread in Singapore,"" he said at a press conference on Friday.

> ""The situation remains fluid, it's constantly changing, and we do not rule out taking further measures,"" added Mr Wong, who is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force tackling the spread of the Wuhan virus here.

> The tough new measures come on the heels of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) announcement on Thursday that the coronavirus epidemic in China now constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

> The virus has now infected over 9,000 people - surpassing Sars, which had over 8,000 infections. It has killed over 200, with China's Wuhan city at the epicentre of the crisis.

> There is no community spread of Wuhan virus within Singapore, Mr Wong stressed, and the authorities are doing everything possible to reduce the risk of this happening.

> Limiting the number of new imported cases here is a key part of this effort.

> Related Story Wuhan virus: Get latest updates

> As of Thursday, 13 people had tested positive for the virus in Singapore. All were travellers from Wuhan.

> The authorities will suspend issuing visas to those with China passports with immediate effect.

> Appeals will be looked at on a case-by-case basis, for instance, if a person holding a China passport has been living elsewhere.

> Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officers will also check the travel history of travellers to ensure that they have not been in China in 14 days. If so, they will be prevented from entering Singapore.

> The WHO believes that it is still possible to interrupt the spread of the virus, provided that countries put in place strong preparedness and response measures, and there has been increased action worldwide to limit global spread by restricting the entry of possible contacts and cases into other countries.

The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in the 19 countries using the euro fell from 7.5 per cent in November to 7.4 per cent in December — its lowest level since May 2008 — with the biggest improvements of last year reported in Greece, Bulgaria and Croatia.

The continued strengthening of the jobs figures will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, which is hoping that tighter labour markets will push up wage growth, encouraging customers to spend more and companies to push up prices.

Unemployment in the eurozone peaked at 19.3m at the height of the eurozone debt crisis in 2013, falling steadily since then to reach 12.25m in December. Youth unemployment remains high at 15.3 per cent, but that is down from a peak of 23.9 per cent.

“Amid a robust labour market, consumers remain confident about their own financial situation,” said Florian Hense, economist at Berenberg. “As Germany recovers gradually and France resolves its strike disruptions, we also look for the rest of the eurozone to return to a healthier pace of growth.”
Mr Hense forecast eurozone economic growth would be only 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, when those figures are announced on Friday, but he said quarterly growth would accelerate to 0.4 per cent by the second half of the year.

In a further positive signal for the eurozone economy, a monthly survey of businesses by the European Commission found a better than expected improvement in sentiment in January — driven by a rebound in the outlook of companies in Germany.

The commission’s economic sentiment indicator rose from 101.3 in December to a five-month high of 102.8 in January. The rise reflected improved sentiment in the industrial and construction sectors, while consumer and services sectors were flat and confidence among retailers fell.
The positive economic data — including higher inflation across much of Germany in January — was offset by growing concerns about how the spread of the coronavirus outbreak in China could hit the world economy.

“Overall, today’s data were a bit better than anticipated, but are not enough to change our view that eurozone economic growth will remain subdued during the first half of this year, and that any subsequent recovery will be weaker than many anticipate,” said Melanie Debono, European economist at Capital Economics. 

Data published earlier on Thursday showed that German unemployment had remained flat at 5 per cent in January, after adjusting for seasonal factors. “The unemployment rate seems to have bottomed out, suggesting that the labour market may now have reached a cyclical peak.” said Nicola Nobile, lead economist at Oxford Economics."

To my understanding, traditional Vietnamese families also celebrate Lunar New Year, which I call CNY because of my background. If you call it VNY, then you can call it that - but at the end of the day, I'm referring to LNY. East Asia being hot-spot of the Coronavirus makes everyone scared of anyone that travelled there recently. The best reason to travel there other than business this time of year? LNY/CNY. Even if our government says to not travel unless it's essential, our cultures revolves around the concept of family. If once a year is all we have to meet up with family and eat/celebrate together, then it's a big deal for some people. Myself, not so much, video calls will suffice with my family. For some, it's like a mandatory thing, and getting sick and potentially dying is worth it for them.

So when people eventually come back home, wherever home is, they're not going to show symptoms. In the case of CBSA, Canada's border services, they can't stop people that aren't full-on sick, human rights and all. These people are not going to broadcast that they just came back from LNY because of being scared that people would ostracise them for celebrating their cultural heritage. With the combination of all this ""what-ifs"", it's a breeding recipe for a perfect storm waiting to happen within the next few weeks; and Asian families know this. Hence, the boycott of places of such places where our cultures generally amass."

Also, according to [this paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2) (page 4) the ""average ascertainment rate in Wuhan"" is 5% due to lack of testing kits.

They lower the rate of particles coming in our out of the mouth. This lowers infection rate, offering herd immunity.

>You misunderstand how this works. It's the size of the virus that's at issue--viruses are small--and surgical masks don't keep them out.

You misunderstand how this works. Virus are extremely small, but they don't travel in vacuum or freely in the air. They travel in minuscule water droplets. If they dry out, they ""die"". 

Infection is also a numbers game. One copy might be stopped by the immune system but a million copies will be successful in establishing themselves. The goal of a barrier between the mouth and nose and the outside world is to lower the transmission rate, not 100% eliminate it. To that effect, any barrier will do.

>Now your conflating prophylactic use of masks with precautions the infected should take.

God have mercy if you are a government official. Given the knowledge you have shown, you are probably a high ranking one. 

There is an incubation period where the infected is contagious without symptoms. For this coronavirus is estimated to 5 days. Wearing a mask for those 5 days lowers the risk of spreading the infection for everyone.

Face masks have been used in medicine for a very long time. There is a good reason for it.

>I'm citing the CDC and reputable public health officials. You're just making wild leaps because you think vitamin C helps when you've got a cold and you misunderstand viral transmission.

You are misquoting the CDC so you can convince yourself that you were not wrong about this. You must love Trump.

""Sure enough, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, appeared on Fox Business on Thursday morning to declare that he “didn’t want to talk about a victory lap,” but that the coronavirus “will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America.” By saying this, he demonstrated a couple of things: (1) why Gail Collins’s readers voted him Trump’s worst cabinet member, and (2) why Trump’s trade war has been such a failure.

""What Ross and his colleagues apparently still don’t understand — although some of them may be getting an inkling — is that modern manufacturing isn’t like manufacturing a couple of generations ago, when different countries’ industrial sectors were engaged in fairly straightforward head-to-head competition. These days we live in a world of global value chains, in which much of what any given nation imports consists not of consumer goods but of “intermediate” goods that it uses as part of its own production process.

""In such a world, anything that disrupts imports — whether it’s tariffs or a virus — raises production costs, and as a result if anything hurts manufacturing. Indeed, a recent study by the Federal Reserve found that Trump’s tariffs, which were concentrated on intermediate goods, have reduced, not increased, manufacturing output and employment. Sure enough, while overall economic growth in 2019 was decent (not great), manufacturing is in a recession. (And the uncertainty created by the trade war may explain why business investment is down despite a huge cut in corporate taxes.)

""As I said, some of Trump’s people seem to have gotten an inkling here. Last week the White House basically admitted that tariffs on steel and aluminum have done more harm than good, hurting industries that use these materials. But the administration’s answer isn’t a reconsideration of its policies — it is to impose more tariffs, on a wider range of products.""

The recently formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said earlier on Friday 6,500 of its members would go on strike if the frontier stayed open, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global emergency.

The WHO recommended all countries try to prevent or reduce cross-border spread of disease, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. But it said measures should avoid unnecessary interference with trade or travel.

“**I am afraid (closing the border) contradicts the WHO suggestion ... which asks governments not to take any measures that may fuel discrimination**,” Lam told a news conference."

> Q: Am I at risk for novel coronavirus from a package or products shipping from China?

> There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS and SARS). 2019-nCoV is more genetically related to SARS than MERS, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. **In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures.** Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. **Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods.**"

Everyone has an ""underlying health condition"" and there are millions of people at risk based on age, immune systems, and other health problems. I'm not fear mongering, but let's not pretend this epidemic isn't dangerous. 

I'm glad China has taken it more seriously this time around, but it's already spread to the mega cities, and it's going to sit in each of those cities for months doing damage.
