While none of the measures are guaranteed to specifically help against coronavirus, there's at least a good chance that if it works for rhinovirus and influenza, it'll probably help.

Based on that, while masks and hand sanitizer get a lot of attention, I think there's some other things that you should stockpile now while they're still available:
* Antiseptic mouthwash
* Zinc supplements
* Interferon
* Probiotics
* Broncho-Vaxom

Also, if you're not already, you should begin a program of moderate exercise three to four times a week. That will build up your immune system if/when an outbreak occurs in your area."

*Most of the infected patients were men (30 \[73%\] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 \[32%\]), including diabetes (eight \[20%\]), hypertension (six \[15%\]), and cardiovascular disease (six \[15%\]). Median age was 49¬∑0 years (IQR 41¬∑0-58¬∑0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 \[98%\] of 41 patients), cough (31 \[76%\]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 \[44%\]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 \[28%\] of 39), headache (three \[8%\] of 38), haemoptysis (two \[5%\] of 39), and diarrhoea (one \[3%\] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8¬∑0 days \[IQR 5¬∑0-13¬∑0\]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 \[29%\]), RNAaemia (six \[15%\]), acute cardiac injury (five \[12%\]) and secondary infection (four \[10%\]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFŒ±. Interpretation: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.*

Perhaps more contagious, though that's debatable, but not necessarily deadlier. Even SARS was deadlier than this new strain.

Also, it's important to note that virus happened in the 20s - before commercial airplanes took off, before globalization and before travel was so readily accessible, sure - but during and right after wartime, which still involved travel (in fact, it even reached the Arctic), and, more importantly, a lack of appropriate healthcare, hygiene, and food, which is why it got to superinfection. 

Obviously you can't treat either virus, but you can treat the symptoms and give your body all the resources needed for it to gather the strength to fight it off. During a time of war, scarcity of food and medicine, and poor hygiene, people stood very little chances. I think it's safe to say that is not really the case this day and age."

From a materials science expert in biomedical grade polymer equipment the protection of permeating based transmission (not airborne) but say saliva entry via external capillaries (sweat glands, eye ducts, mouth, nose) this is protection for general carriers, in this case, saliva which is mucus based. Direct exposure to a sneeze onto your mask will be protected by upwards of 99% while this also means changing out the mask directly after immediate exposure. In order for N95 to be maximized in an aggressive environment they must be switched out every 2 hours while in active exposure.

Those diseases take from some weeks to about 2 months in order to kill someone or be cured.

People with weak immune system died first because they were in crowded hospitals (most of them died in Wuhan) and probably they took sometime to notice the disease since it was kinda new.
But you know about the disease and you will probably go to a hospital with more conditions to treat you. So they will give you medication to fight the symptoms (oxygen, drugs, antipyretic...) and to make your body stronger, so your body will have time to fight the virus.

Reddit such as chinaflu and this one is where people seem to share news and are not full of trolls, doomsayers and people that want to sell you a cure (yes... there are people out there claiming they have a cure, be it in a bottle, or a electronic device that simply ""purges all viruses and bacteria from you instantly"")

If youre looking for ""leaked"" videos, the simplest way is on youtube. 
You will most likely find older videos that have been re-uploaded for multiple days, and as time goes on, weeks.

If you are trying to find fresh leaked videos youll have to dig them up and put some more effort, tho most of those have no context or description.

LiveLeak also has multiple videos, often with some context but its kinda hard to find fresh ones.

Facebook and twitter has various pictures, tweets and screenshots, sometimes videos but i assume it will get harder and harder to find them since both companies announced they will be removing ""fake news"" regarding the virus , and with time as the machine learning gets better it will be harder i suppose"

&#x200B;

* Travel restrictions
* School/transport/work closures
* Shortages of items like  masks, maybe non-perishable food
* Overloading of the health/emergency system
* Civil disorder (i.e. protests/riots)
* Infrastructure disruption  


Quarantines and travel bans are already affecting way more people than the virus itself, and that will likely continue to be the case.    


So the most important things to think about: Is there somewhere for your kids to stay if school's closed? Do you have an adequate supply of any medications? Can you avoid travel to locations where you might be stranded? Can you arrange to work from home if necessary?"

Even so:

* Multiple news, both official and rumored indicates this started last year. It even has ""2019"" in its name.
* Even for china, nobody in their right mind would lock down 60.000.000 people because there were 1000 confirmed infected and like 100 deaths.
* Just as china didn't change their ways of censorship and maintaining control over their people and information, the rest of the world didn't change their ways of trying to maintain the flow of economy at a risk of peoples health. Meaning just cause they got praised by WHO the other day they wont suddenly say ""okay these are actually the real numbers""

However, even if china was honest and released real numbers there are several problems that would cause numbers to not show realistic figures:

* Panic in china flooded hospitals, specially in the beginning when most people didnt even know what symptoms were caused by the virus.  
Do not forget there are other illnesses and diseases, and even catching a common cold (it is flu season after all) will send people into the hospitals trying to get tested for the virus.  

* China has a hard time keeping up distributing test kits, eye witness says wuhan got 10,000 test kits , for a city with over 10,000,000 people.  
Further more, people are ordered to stay indoors, there is no public transportation, and the ambulance phones are all busy so people cant get to hospitals to get tested.  
All this meaning people dont get tested, and cant be confirmed and reported as infected.  
And on the other side, people that die of pneumonia or such are not having an autopsy ,instead are just written off as ""died of pneumonia"" and it does not contribute towards the number of death caused by the virus.
* Add to the fact many people fled wuhan before they even announced the lock down ,as well as the unfortunate timing of the outbreak being the chinese new year which involves millions of people from and outside china to traveling everywhere, spreading the virus which has an incubation period of 5-14 days during which it can still spread around to other humans isnt helping anyone.

The world is currently in a race between prevention/containment and everyone that is infected but is in the incubation period. 

At one point , the virus will start showing suddenly more and more, but it will be easier for us to contain and slow down the spread since we can actually start seeing it. 

But thats just my opinion based on observation, and i don't claim i'm an expert"

Firstly, we don‚Äôt even know if the virus can infect people while the virus is in the incubation period/shows no symptoms. That has not been confirmed, if someone has heard differently please share a link to a reliable source. 
Secondly, what is the motivation to infect their own citizens? The biggest disaster right now is in China/for Chinese people, with only about 100 cases confirmed outside China to date (and no deaths outside China so far right?) Not to mention the social consequences including unfortunately some racism for Chinese people living/travelling internationally at the moment. 
And even though we‚Äôre waiting for more data as the situation progresses so this estimate could change, I think that the death rate so far is around 2-4% based on current reports - lower than both MERS (34%) and SARS (10%). So it‚Äôs not a super potent choice of biological weapon if that‚Äôs what it was intended to be. I think the most likely explanation is the official report. Viruses have been known to pass from animals to humans rarely in the past and cause similar outbreaks."

The most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for the current coronavirus is via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the viral sequence is known and specific probes have already been designed to detect presence of viral RNA/DNA. 72 hours is plenty of time for PCR to be able to detect trace amounts of virus for people who are infected (despite being asymptomatic). It has a very low false negative rate, so we should not be overly concerned about the short observation time unless something changes in the immediate future (i.e. virus mutates and renders diagnostics unreliable - highly highly unlikely)."

You want more evidence? Confirmed cases are popping up across the world. Can you guess how that happened? People traveled from a place that was identified by WHO as the source of a global emergency.

But the most convincing evidence is thus: it‚Äôs already too late to prevent outbreaks in other countries by restricting travel, due to the slow reporting from China.

And one last piece of evidence: WHO needs data from China. China‚Äôs government is notorious for holding grudges. If WHO accosts China too strongly they will not get the data they need."

Usually 10-20% of the air you breath is not filtered. Surgical masks are inferior to N95, N99 and P100 masks  This short video covers it pretty well  [https://youtu.be/JR2uLfEVD2w](https://youtu.be/JR2uLfEVD2w)

 Used masks should be replaced but I understand you have no other options and masks are pretty much sold out. I use P100 respirators but I understand your position . Personally I would hold onto your N95 masks over a 1 ply. I wouldn‚Äôt use alcohol or lysol as it can reduce or eliminate the electrostatic charges on N95 Masks/Respirators 

Everything below is in regards to N95 and N99 and P100 particulate respirators and masks. Not the entire Respirator Assembly. Just the actual filter or soft flexible filter masks. Not special respirator filters that use activated carbon. VOC or ACID protection masks. Heating those up can reduce or damage the ability to remove, VOC‚Äôs ozone, oils, acids etc,.. 

Masks with blood on them, torn or damaged are considered beyond help.

Modern N95  respirators (particulate respirators) use filtering media and also electrostatic charged particles to capture smaller particles by electrostatic attraction. interception, and diffusion. Studies have shown that alcohol and lysol reduce the electrostatic properties and reduce the masks ability to work properly. 

It‚Äôs important for a mask to keep it‚Äôs electrostatic properties as the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is .125 microns in size and much smaller than the actual filtering media. 

Obviously a damaged mask is better than no mask at all. I know of a few ways to kill of the coronavirus. UV-C light but it would take a full chapter to explain how and you probably don‚Äôt have the light to do it.

Heat works but you have to be very careful to reach the proper temperature while not getting the respirator so hot as to melt it or damage the strength of the fibers. Studies have shown that heating the Coronavirus to 150F or 56C for 15 minutes will kill it off. 

The safest and easiest way to kill off the coronavirus is to put your N95‚Äôs in a food dehydrator for 30 minutes. Most can be set at 155F to 165F but most people don‚Äôt have one.

If you have an oven that can drop the temperature to 160F. Most ovens won‚Äôt heat below 180F. You could preheat the oven to 180F. Wrap the N95 mask in aluminum foil place it in the center of an oven making sure it‚Äôs not near any heating elements and heat it for 30 minutes.  The aluminum helps keep the mask clean and prevents hot spots inside.  Aluminum foil is not mandatory but a good Idea as ovens are not clean environments. Some problems you could run into are getting the mask too hot and damaging or melting the rubber strap.

Autoclaves run 121C or 250F are too hot and will cause damage to the mask and the  electrostatic properties to some degree.

Here are a list of articles covering all types of Disinfecting  masks and Respirators. The 155-165 F food dehydrator or 160-180 Oven way will probably be your only options.

All these explanations (not only yours, but also those from all the other people writing walls of text trying to explain why something not racist is racist) try to look educated, but always  have at least one big logical flaw (at least of those I saw).

How does your explanation about the evolution of the term ""race"" or the composition of Chinese ethnicity explain that you are telling me what¬¥s going on in my head when I say ""Chinese have nasty food habits"" or ""Japanese people made the best food culture in my opinion""? How is that evolution relevant to what I and many other people on this planet view as actual despicable racism? (btw those are just examples, not my actual opinions) In my case, if you do that, the only thing you achieve by doing that is falsely accusing someone (and in an especially rude way, that means telling them how they think while not giving a fuck how they actually think)  and giving someone a free pass to do wrong things.

Why don¬¥t you explicitly answer my question -  If I go the other way and I love Japanese food (I‚Äôm a white european) and i think it‚Äôs superior to other foods, I‚Äôm a racist? 

The only thing where I agree with you ""anything what has to do even remotely with race is racism"" guys is that asian looking people getting dumb looks or even worse from other people is bad for them, I am sorry for them and in a perfect world, they wouldn¬¥t have to go through this shit."
