Also, is there any info on how exactly SARS/MERS was ruled out? Could this be some related coronavirus, for example? Simply saying it's not SARS/MERS leaves basically everything else on the table. SARS hasn't been seen circulating since the outbreak (of course it wasn't seen prior, either), but there's still plenty of contact with other circulating coronaviruses of similar flavor."
