I don’t trust Brix. She is very much in support of helping this administration when they pivot (in the wrong direction) on public health policy. Take a look at the public address video where a reporter brought up a rational point that if Rand Paul didn’t go against trump’s guidelines and get tested, even though he wasn’t symptomatic or met anyone who later tested positive,he wouldn’t have known he was positive and would have went to congress infecting a lot of our (older) governmental representatives. 

Her response to that was something along the lines of “that’s why we tell people to wash their hands...”



Also when trump had his *brilliant* idea to get the country back to normal and working again. She defended that as well saying we can use a granular approach opening up states for normal work and closing hot spots etc. 

Dr Fauci didn’t back trump on any of his crackpot ideas. Fauci has been the most consistent voice there is. Even when pressured to endorse trumps timeline he responded saying the virus makes the time line not us. 

This country is lucky to have Fauci. Brix is a dime a dozen sell out, there to endorse administrative decisions even when they negate public health policy."

Brazil's airplane was already in route. It stopped in Miami just to refuel.

What the US did was to tell the Chinese companies to CANCEL the deals (that were already closed) because they will offer more money.

By the way, the airplane to Brazil had 600 ventilators that were commissioned by the poorest region from Brazil. The federal government in Brazil is refusing to help (the president is insane and is telling people to go outside and work), so the states in these regions got together and bought 600 ventilators by themselves, without the government's help.

So the US is taking ventilators from the poorest region of a third-world country. Let that sink in...

It might not be comfortable, you might feel like it makes you look stupid, whatever. But if you just come out and say ""here's the recommendation"", and put it on in a press conference, then you have the easiest leadership by example demonstration ever.  People (who align themselves with the president) would see his example and think ""okay, if the president does it, maybe I should too"".

Until now, almost all body collection fell to the funeral homes, who didn't have any PPE or bio-hazard training. And cremation used to be a luxury the poor couldn't afford. So, we assigned all body recovery to the Transit Police who're now geared up and going, and we've made free burial an option. And, we made it easier to get a Death Cert.

> Trump at a FEB 28 rally: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa, they can’t even count. No they can’t. They can’t count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We’re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.

He is **clearly** saying that Russia was a hoax, the impeachment was a hoax, and that the corona virus is the liberals new hoax. That can't possibly be up for discussion - it's very, very clearly his meaning.

Edit: /u/FlREBALL - Why would the part of the quote you use for context be the part where he accuses the democrats of politicizing it? A) There's no basis for that - they were speaking the truth and B) We're talking about what he is describing as the hoax. Here is the part that we're focusing on:

> They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. **And this is their new hoax.**

How could he possibly be saying the democrats are the hoax here? He says, ""**this** is **their** new hoax"". This sentence is synonymous with what Trump said:

""The corona virus(this) is the democrats(their) new hoax.""

This isn't debatable. This isn't my opinion. I just described facts akin to gravity and evolution. He said - without question - that the corona virus is a hoax."

He can't  help himself, he has to shake my hand and I get a test! Mission accomplished!

Now, as in late 1944, there is a sense of inchoate danger, aimed not at any particular person, but striking randomly and with devastation. But there is an important difference between that faraway time and ours. American endurance then was fortified by an ultimate national purpose. Now, in a divided country, efficient and farsighted government is necessary to overcome obstacles unprecedented in magnitude and global scope. Sustaining the public trust is crucial to social solidarity, to the relation of societies with each other, and to international peace and stability.

>Nations cohere and flourish on the belief that their institutions can foresee calamity, arrest its impact and restore stability. When the Covid-19 pandemic is over, many countries’ institutions will be perceived as having failed. Whether this judgment is objectively fair is irrelevant. The reality is the world will never be the same after the coronavirus. To argue now about the past only makes it harder to do what has to be done.

>The coronavirus has struck with unprecedented scale and ferocity. Its spread is exponential: U.S. cases are doubling every fifth day. At this writing, there is no cure. Medical supplies are insufficient to cope with the widening waves of cases. Intensive-care units are on the verge, and beyond, of being overwhelmed. Testing is inadequate to the task of identifying the extent of infection, much less reversing its spread. A successful vaccine could be 12 to 18 months away.

>The U.S. administration has done a solid job in avoiding immediate catastrophe. The ultimate test will be whether the virus’s spread can be arrested and then reversed in a manner and at a scale that maintains public confidence in Americans’ ability to govern themselves. The crisis effort, however vast and necessary, must not crowd out the urgent task of launching a parallel enterprise for the transition to the post-coronavirus order.

>Leaders are dealing with the crisis on a largely national basis, but the virus’s society-dissolving effects do not recognize borders. While the assault on human health will—hopefully—be temporary, the political and economic upheaval it has unleashed could last for generations. No country, not even the U.S., can in a purely national effort overcome the virus. Addressing the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program. If we cannot do both in tandem, we will face the worst of each.

>Drawing lessons from the development of the Marshall Plan and the Manhattan Project, the U.S. is obliged to undertake a major effort in three domains. First, shore up global resilience to infectious disease. Triumphs of medical science like the polio vaccine and the eradication of smallpox, or the emerging statistical-technical marvel of medical diagnosis through artificial intelligence, have lulled us into a dangerous complacency. We need to develop new techniques and technologies for infection control and commensurate vaccines across large populations. Cities, states and regions must consistently prepare to protect their people from pandemics through stockpiling, cooperative planning and exploration at the frontiers of science.

>Second, strive to heal the wounds to the world economy. Global leaders have learned important lessons from the 2008 financial crisis. The current economic crisis is more complex: The contraction unleashed by the coronavirus is, in its speed and global scale, unlike anything ever known in history. And necessary public-health measures such as social distancing and closing schools and businesses are contributing to the economic pain. Programs should also seek to ameliorate the effects of impending chaos on the world’s most vulnerable populations.

>Third, safeguard the principles of the liberal world order. The founding legend of modern government is a walled city protected by powerful rulers, sometimes despotic, other times benevolent, yet always strong enough to protect the people from an external enemy. Enlightenment thinkers reframed this concept, arguing that the purpose of the legitimate state is to provide for the fundamental needs of the people: security, order, economic well-being, and justice. Individuals cannot secure these things on their own. The pandemic has prompted an anachronism, a revival of the walled city in an age when prosperity depends on global trade and movement of people.

>The world’s democracies need to defend and sustain their Enlightenment values. A global retreat from balancing power with legitimacy will cause the social contract to disintegrate both domestically and internationally. Yet this millennial issue of legitimacy and power cannot be settled simultaneously with the effort to overcome the Covid-19 plague. Restraint is necessary on all sides—in both domestic politics and international diplomacy. Priorities must be established.

>We went on from the Battle of the Bulge into a world of growing prosperity and enhanced human dignity. Now, we live an epochal period. The historic challenge for leaders is to manage the crisis while building the future. Failure could set the world on fire."

You can't create someone who had trained for a minimum of 11 years over two weeks.

You should be making policies to make your state attractive to these and other professionals, whether it's student loan forgiveness, tort reform, protecting autonomy, funding research, or just having a robust health department.

That is the opposite of what we and the Administration, on behalf of the American people, both seek.""

They're buying them and giving them to US distributors, either for the states to bid over, or for the distributor to then sell again to the original foreign party because the Feds haven't banned the export of this equipment. In some cases the distributor is selling the same mask multiple times, only for the feds to buy it again each time and hand it back for free to the distributor. 

What's more, we have a mechanism to share this with foreign governments - it's called USAID, so if we do have surpluses, the feds can responsibly share that, except this administration seems unaware that USAID exists because they keep buying back the supplies that USAID is sending abroad. 

And note that in none of these infinite loops are hospitals getting the supplies."

No, it takes direct person-to-person contact.”

This program's terms are still incredible.

Initially, Treasury wanted to do a 0.5% interest rate on a 10 year loan.

Ultimately, a number of banks (who SBA loans are originated through) indicated that they would not be able to market loans on those terms to the secondary market and so would end up not participating in issuing these loans.  To get more banks to agree to facilitate these loans for small business, they raised the rate to 1% and with a 2 year loan term.

Let me be clear.  For any small business in the US (or anywhere, to my knowledge), even if this was \_only\_ a loan program (I'll come back to that in a minute), this is the cheapest borrowing any small business is likely to ever come upon.  Normally lending to small businesses is a lot more like credit card borrowing.  Not good rates, as many are fairly high risk to lend to.

It's a sweetheart deal of a loan program, even after the banks persuaded treasury to double the interest rate from 0.5 to 1.0.

But the big deal is, if a small business uses this loan as intended (to pay payroll, utilities, and rent for two months), the loan will be \_forgiven\_.  That's right.  It sounds too good to be true.  They just write off the loan and you owe nothing back.  The only thing the small business has to do is commit to not laying off / significantly reducing head count.  And in exchange, free money to pay that payroll and utilities and rent.

This is the most pro-small-business thing I've seen come out of the US Federal Government in my more than 20 years in business."

In a state like mine -Texas

Only police/first responders can be tested without screening

Others have to pass the screening process, if their local tester has any tests.

My wife and I failed the process with the following criteria;

Fever
Aches
Shortness of breath
Tiredness
Cough

Because we didn’t travel to a hotspot, or have contact with anyone who tested positive.

This was 21 days ago, we have since not been able to be antibody tested.

Texas has relaxed testing requirements to Fever, and breathing issue. Many still don’t qualify and if they do testing centers run out of tests early.

Meaning.... most of us are not getting tested or not getting tested when we need to. And are awaiting Antibody testing.

This causes massive amounts of stress because of the unknown!!!

In Texas we’ve tested less than 1% of population, meaning any data we present is bullshit!"

Another key is the need to switch patients vented longer than 1-2 weeks to tracheostomies, but you need surgeons to do this, open ORs, and it’s a very risky procedure in terms of transmission of viral particles even with proper PPE.

They shut their model down yesterday and have a message saying they will boot it back up on the 4th with new data. I kind of think their model might have started to spit out too scary of numbers.

I'm not saying this is an accurate prediction, but if you assume that the exponential growth rate seen in deaths over the past 5 days continues to April 16th, that very simple model spits out 42,000 deaths per day. I thought I might have made a mistake when I first saw that number, but it correctly predicted past days when I plugged their dates in.

----

Model:

deaths per day = e^(0.2684*d+5.816) where d= days since March 28

r^2 = 0.95

I chose March 28 because I only wanted to use recent data, but I also wanted to have enough data to measure some error. Also I'm lazy and didn't want to painstakingly copy and paste more data.
