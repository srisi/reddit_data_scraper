March 23: Democratic concerns have focused on a $500 billion funding program Republicans want to create for loans and loan guarantees, with some Democrats calling it a “slush fund” that lacks any oversight because the Treasury Department would have broad discretion over who receives the money.

\-New York State today [has 37,258 cases, as per NYTimes.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html)

&#x200B;

\-According to the Governor, [cases are doubling every 3 days, and we are 14-21 days away from apex, as per NPR 2 days ago.](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/24/820891370/coronavirus-n-y-infection-rate-is-doubling-about-every-3-days-cuomo-says)

&#x200B;

\-So now for a little bit of math, just a back of the envelope calculation. Based on [this curve of number of cases vs time](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html), the rate of increase keeps going up until the apex, so assuming Cuomo's definition of apex means the peak of this curve, we will ""double"" the number of cases 4 or 6 times (4 intervals or 6 intervals of 3 days based on the 12-19 days until apex from today), and this is assuming no further decrease in days required to double the cases until apex. So, we will therefore have somewhere between 37,258\*2\^4 and 37,258\*2\^6 cases until we hit our peak rate of cases, so anywhere between 596128 and 2384512 cases in NY State alone until we hit the peak.

&#x200B;

\-That's not all. This is only until we hit the peak. The curve is symmetric, so the total number of cases before the peak=total number of cases after the peak, so one more 2X multiplication. So NY State alone, based on my crude math and the numbers we see in the news, will see anywhere between 1.2 million and 4.8 million cases, which is anywhere between 6% to 25% of its total population, with significant social distancing and other measures.

&#x200B;

\-Surely (I hope) something is wrong somewhere either with Cuomo's statements or these numbers, but us being 2-3 weeks from the halfway point seems absurd."

Not all places or populations will respond to a disease similarly. There can be significant differences. Here are my notes on Italy with links to data and sources. 

Data from [Italian National Institute of Health](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Report-COVID-2019_20_marzo_eng.pdf):

* Median age of fatalities is 80.5.
* Zero fatalities under 30.
* 99.1% of fatalities are over 50. 
* 97.6% of fatalities are over 60.
* 99.2% already had one or more serious health conditions (cancer, chronic heart disease, chronic liver disease, etc).
* About half already had three or more serious health conditions.

**Why is Italy So Different?**

* ""[Italy is one of the oldest populations](https://osf.io/fd4rh/?view_only=c2f00dfe3677493faa421fc2ea38e295) in the world.""
* Italians are more antibiotic-resistant with the [highest rates of antibiotic resistance deaths](http://www.ansa.it/english/news/science_tecnology/2019/11/19/italy-top-in-eu-in-antibiotic-resistance_369e0123-0107-445e-8c17-f11932c9d27c.html) in Europe. 
* Northern Italy has Europe's [highest concentration of PM2.5 particulate pollution](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/pm2-5-annual-mean-in-1/image_large) which is [significantly correlated with ARDS.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30067389)
* Only 12% of Italy's reported ~6000 CV19 fatalities are confirmed from CV19 because Italy reports any ""[Death with an infection""](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/have-many-coronavirus-patients-died-italy/) as a ""Death *from* an infection"". 
* Italy's ~7% CFR is statistically inflated due to primarily [testing only the very elderly or already ill.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjzjpc/relationship_between_the_abo_blood_group_and_the/fks0yig/)
* Every year Italians smoke [1493 cigarettes per person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita) with 1 in 4 active smokers. 
* Historically, flu-like illnesses have hit Italy much worse than elsewhere. Italy averages over [22,000 seasonal flu deaths](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285) a year.

*[Journal of Infectious Diseases, Aug 2019](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712\(19\)30328-5/fulltext)*

> In recent years, Italy has been registering peaks in death rates, particularly among the elderly during the winter season. Italy showed a higher influenza attributable excess mortality compared to other European countries especially in the elderly.

*[Demographic Science COVID-19](https://osf.io/fd4rh/?view_only=c2f00dfe3677493faa421fc2ea38e295)*

> Italy is characterized by extensive intergenerational contacts which are supported by a high degree of residential proximity between adult children and their parents. Even when inter-generational families do not live together, daily contacts among non-co-resident parent-child pairs are frequent. According to the latest available data by the Italian National Institute of Statistics, this extensive commuting affect over half of the population in the northern regions. These intergenerational interactions, co-residence, and commuting patterns may have accelerated the outbreak in Italy through social networks that increased the proximity of elderly to initial cases.

Although the U.S. and Italy both started uncontrolled community transmission the same week in January and the U.S. adopted weaker containment measures well after Italy, CV19 is behaving very differently in the U.S. The U.S. will have more total confirmed cases than Italy sometime tomorrow and yet the U.S. has less than 1/7th the fatalities. People have been claiming ""The U.S. is only 10 days behind Italy"" for 19 days now yet the Italian data above shows a median of 8 days from first symptoms to fatality.

It runs into one of the brick walls of proto-fascist thoughts: how can you *both* claim that your opponents are a massive threat *and* the fact that you're constantly winning against them? Those are contradictory statements, and that's why you end up with word salad like: *""[they're] doing everything in [their] semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!)""*. They're strong and scary, you should vote for me! But also we're 100% kicking their asses! But still, ooh they're dangerous but we're stronger but not so strong as to thwart them but still kinda!

I know it's a cliché at this point, but it's literally out of Umberto Eco's *Ur-Fascism*, point 8:

>The followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies. [...] However, the followers must be
convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak. Fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy."

My evidence to Parliament referred to the numbers of deaths we assess might occur in the UK in the presence of the very intensive social distancing and other public health interventions now in place.

>During an online question-and-answer session with Warriors guard Stephen Curry on Thursday morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci made one thing clear: The coronavirus crisis should not be taken lightly.
Asked whether people were overreacting about the spread of the respiratory disease, Fauci — the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — didn’t mince words, saying, “This is serious business.”

Speaking on an Instagram live feed, Fauci explained what someone should do if he or she believes they have the coronavirus, how to best practice social distancing and why this pandemic might not completely go away any time soon. As Fauci put it, “You need to see the trajectory of the curve start to come down. … Europe, particularly Italy, is in a terrible situation.
“They’re still going way up. The United States is a big country. We have so many different regions. It’s particularly bad in New York City right now, yet there are places in the country that are doing really quite well. You could probably identify people who have it, get them out of circulation, whereas in New York City, it’s doing what’s called ‘mitigation,’ trying to prevent as best you can the spread.”

Not surprisingly, Curry’s Q&A with Dr. Fauci attracted a massive viewership. Among the celebrities who commented on it were former President Barack Obama, Justin Bieber, Common and Heat forward Andre Iguodala."

Putin didn't say they will defeat coronavirus in less than three months. Did anyone actually bother to watch the televised meeting with the entrepreneurs?. An entrepreneur said businesses will suffer significantly if the lock down measures continue for three months, Putin replied to him: ""when we finally get out of this situation, and we definitely will get out of it... I hope that will be even sooner than what you said"" .  
>  
>At no point did Putin tell the entrepreneur that Russia ""can defeat coronavirus in less than three onths"". He simply said he hopes Russia can get out of the situation and he hopes that it is sooner than the 3 months the entrepreneur said. Context is really important here and I know Redditors love nothing more than Putin & Russian bashing. Isn't the American president saying he wants everything back to normal by Easter? Now that is laughable

I am in no way, shape or form suggesting these projections are ""Feeding false hope"", nor am I ""suspicious"" of them in any way. I'm suggesting we recognize that projections are exactly that...projections...and will constantly be adjusted and revised based on best available data.

r/coronavirus is allergic to ""hope"" in general and believes anything that isn't a worst case scenario is ""false hope"". They will leap to embrace any and all bad news stories, no matter how exaggerative, and cast scorn and doubt on anything promising. It's exhausting.

The lesson here isn't ""this sounds promising, therefore it's bullshit"". It's that projections should be treated as projections, and not prophecies. r/coronavirus collectively needs to stop flying off the handle every time they get a scrap of data or read a worrying headline. It's a dynamic situation. It is always changing."

In the last three days it's up like 20% putting us at around -12% from the at time high and you have to be down 20% or more to be in a bear market. 

I don't know history all that well. We went from all time high to bear faster than ever so maybe this was the bottom and the bear market IS over. That said, with unemployment claims spiking to 3.1M this week which is almost 4x the previous record, the number of cases of the Coronavirus still going up and accelerating too- I do not think this is the end of the bear market.

* Confirmed: 867
* ICU: 91
* Hospitalizations: 223
* Deaths: 15
* Age Range: 1-94 years of age
* Median Age: 51
* Females: 47% 
* Males: 53%

**Press Briefing 3/26/20 2pm**

* Gov. Mike DeWine:
   * Shares video from CLeveland Indians and Cincinnatti Reds
   * Clearing up questions:
      * Evictions: Bill will go into effect tomorrow. Our courts remain open only working essential cases. Section 22810: civil and criminal time limits on hold 3/9-7/30. This means an evciction can be filed, but courts do not have to hear that case on their normal required times. Courts could stay the actions for a period of time as well. Our courts do need allowed flexibility for special cases such as dmestic violence or someone dealing drugs from rented property. Once bill is signed tomorrow, cheif justive will pass instructions on to the courts.
      * Weddings & Funerals: Not prohibited under the order, but we just ask not to have large gatherings. Many people are just post poning the big ceremonies until after this crisis is over. 
   * Things we are doing (physical distancing): 
      * Mayors and officials for Baseball Opening Day have moved forward with postponing / cancelling the big parades. 
      * These actions are buying us time with this virus and infection rates. We want to make sure no matter where you are in Ohio if you get sick, we have a process of where you should go and at what time. We are trying to tie all our hospitals together right now. We know we need more capacity, but don’t yet know how mcuh we will need. We should be close to Maryland’s capacity soon. Doing what you are doing to slow this down is buying us all so much more time.
   * Contacting us to Help:
      * So many of you have contacted our offices to ask how you can help. We are setting something up now online where you can go to see what we need and how you can help or donate. together@govenor.ohio.gov
* Dr. Amy Acton:
   * Greetings. This time each of these days has been an anchor for me.
   * Going over the Data. [www.coronavirus.ohio.gov](http://www.coronavirus.ohio.gov/) to find all of this data and see the new dashboard. The new interactive dashboard has much details than previously. 
      * Again these confimred cases are the tip of the iceburg. We have 60 counties now. We have so many presumptive cases as well that we cannot test.
      * 23 years old to 92 years old is the range of people ending up in the ICU
      * We’ve tested over 17,000 people. 17% of those tested positive are healthcare workers. One of our toledo healthcare departments has had at least 2 cases and has had to mostly shutdown.
      * 40-70% of us will have had this sickness over the course of the year.
      * 15% of confirmed cases are hospitalized. 
      * We now have a look at Ohio’s curve. Please go and check this out online. The more testing the better the models will be. The peak of our curve could have been detrimental had we not taken the precautions we’ve taken. The more we push this out and slow down the infectious rate the flatter our curve gets.
      * We will surge. At our peak surge we could be at 6000-8000 new cases A DAY. We will exceed our capacity. But we must continue to try and slow this down.
      * Dr. Fauci shared recent research: we know there will be differnt highpoints - it wil not be a smooth curve. We do not yet know the affect of seasonality on this virus.
      * PPE: If we had done nothing, we would have exceeded our PPE already. Even with the measures we are taking we know we are going to need millions more n95 masks.
      * MOD NOTE: The data on the site now is invauable. **PLEASE LOOK FOR YOURSELF.** [https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/home/dashboard](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/home/dashboard)
   * A coronavirus patient can be hospitalized for up to 20 days. Everything we see is lagging. It can be days before you show symptoms, it can be days before you need to be hospitalized and it can be days before you then need ICU. Following ICU it can be weeks before death. 
   * This is real. This is LIFE OR DEATH. Please continue to take this seriously and please stay home. 
   * How we mourn and how we celebrate will have to be different… Postponing these things is the safest thing you can do. Stay strong, stay together, and stay at home, Ohio.
* Lt. Gov. Jon Husted:
   * We feel so responsible to you. We are trying to do everything e can on our end to ease your burdens.
      * Unemployment: 187,780 claims made in Ohio by end of 3/21/20. In 2019 369,594 total unemployment claims. We are adding servers to build capacity in our unemployment filings to help ease this particular burden. Its kind of like Rush Hour right now. → backed up. Be reassured your benefis will be placed retroactively if you have been unable to complete filing.
      * 10-99 and self employed: These resources are coming from the federal level. 
   * Essential Business List: read the plain language of the order and use your good jusgement to follow that order. 
      * You do not need a certificate to operate. But create a written justification in the case law enforcement or health department stop by to ask why your business is operating. 
      * Call law enforcement and health departments only to report non complying businesses not to ask for clarification of the order. 
      * Expect to get reported and be prepapred to justify why you are operating and how you are keeping your workplace safe.
   * 4/28/20 Vote Bill: Bill passes tomorrow and you can go online or call local board of elections to request an absentee ballot which you will be able to send in by April 28th. We do not expect to have in person voting.
   * If you can work from home, do it. There are many of you who cannot do that, and we are grateful to you. Everyone else, be respectful of our essential workforce. Protect them so they can protect us.
      * Doctor’s Message:  “its scary for us working in the hospital systems, and we have these personnel putting their lives and their families lives at risk by just doing their jobs. They are doing this to keep us healthy. They ask we stay home to avoid putting more people in jeopardy”.
* Press Questions

&#x200B;

* Sorry I ran a little behind today.
* Please see the included links to see data presented by Dr. Acton today.
* Please be safe and stay home if you are able to."

It *should* be our job as a nationwide NotMeUs movement to circumvent and mitigate their censorship, weaponized edits and purposeful misinformation but we've been wasting a lot of our energy complaining to each other instead of becoming a true threat to the corrupt in nightmarish ways for them.

Bernie, of course, just had a landslide win against Biden in the the primary for Americans who voted from overseas. These are Americans who aren't subjected near as much to MSNBC as Americans at home are.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/politics/bernie-sanders-wins-democrats-abroad/index.html

There's a vital, valuable *lesson* to be learned by this result and we must strategize accordingly. This just goes to show that the Corporate Media Empire is all that stands between the huge NotMeUs movement and the American people.

This is clearly information warfare and we can mitigate and circumvent their attack if we think strategically instead of trying the same online things over and over again expecting better results.

🖨 HERE IS HOW WE WIN INFORMATION WARFARE 🖨

The national narrative is set against progressives by a multi-billion dollar Corporate Media Empire in control of what tens of millions of fearful Americans think and feel. #NotMeUs has lost its way and forgotten what **bottom-up** means — along with the power we have if we utilize ourselves in that manner instead of looking to serve a top-down savior. We can still turn this sinking ship around if we finally face our greatest enemy — ourselves.

Too many progressives are talking about what Bernie should do instead of what NotMeUs should do for vital **outreach**. Until progressive shows on Youtube understand this is a *bottom-up* decentralized movement, stop preaching (and complaining) to the choir and instead focusing much more on organizing strategic pans, they are useless for our outreach strategy.

🖨 Acquire used laser printers w/toner any way you can. Print flyers, brochures and pamphlets in the thousands for pennies on the dollar. Put MEMES on the cover and place vital facts inside that the Corporate Media Empire hides from average Americans in order to protect themselves from public ire.

SPREAD EVERYWHERE post-coronavirus, but PREPARE NOW. Get your content ready now. Start looking for used laser printers and paper now. Start printing now. That way as soon as the coronavirus abates WE ATTACK and bring a nationwide, national nightmare to the corrupt. We bring the thing they FEAR the most because it will destroy them. We bring the truth they hide to the public at large.

They censor us on television. They censor and mute our message to the general public on social media. We circumvent that and bring our message directly to the people WHERE THEY ARE in stores and to their doors nationwide. Place vital information on Medicare For All in brochures within the pockets of new clothes at Target. Make humorous Starbucks flyers to place at coffee shops nationwide that let Americans know that MSNBC and FOX News are both lying to them and prove it with facts and evidence they've never been exposed to before.

Let's launch the largest guerrilla marketing attack against the establishment since the American Revolution.

MSNBC, CNN, FOX News and social media corporations control the narrative for tens of millions of voters. Until we circumvent their purposeful misinformation by distributing facts to the public we will always be at their mercy and lose.
🖨 NotMeUs POWER. Use it or lose it. Stop putting faith in Bernie to take on a multi-billion dollar Corp Media Empire hellbent on subjecting you, your family and friends to evil people that put money and power above all humanity.
NotMeUsRevolution Take it to the NEXT LEVEL. PUT YOUR MEMES ON THE TABLE.

You are potentially exposed every time you leave the house, with the likelihood increasing with the more people you encounter. The best you can do is be thoughtful and take steps to reduce the risk of infection.

This means committing to buying something before touching it, disinfecting cart handles, frequently washing/sanitizing hands, removing/washing clothes and showering once you return home, and of course, avoiding touching your face as much as possible.

""In difficult and frightening times, it's normal for a certain amount of confusion and misinformation to spread. The existence of social media and hyperpartisan ""news"" outlets undoubtedly exacerbate the problem, but even those are just exaggerated versions of things that have been with us for some time.

But two things make the torrent of coronavirus misinformation distinct. The first one is simple: much of the misinformation starts at the top, where President Donald Trump seems willing to say whatever crosses his mind when he finds himself in front of a microphone.

But the second is trickier: unlike a national disaster or terrorist attack, we have no models for how long the coronavirus pandemic will last or how we will recover from it. There's no ""we'll rebuild"" mindset that people can use to make sense out of what's going to happen and guide their expectations.

Here's how we might create one."""

If you're really going to check it out, the manga is legendary, masterful, and, beautifully drawn. However, it's been going on for 30+ years and doesn't seem any closer to being completed than it has in the past 10 years. Basically, enjoy binge reading it if you do, because once you finish it, it's about 5-6 months between chapter releases, if we pray to the god hand.  

As far as anime, I wholeheartedly recommend the 1997 anime, which has 25 episodes, and encompasses arguably the best story arc to date. It also has a boner inducing classic OST. However, many new fans are put off by the older style of anime, which is an opinion that's completely wrong, but we can't all be perfect. If that's the case I'd suggest the Golden Age Arc movies, there's 3 of em. Type in Berserk Golden Age Arc in google, you'll find it. I will strongly advise you to stay the fuck away from the new anime adaptations called Berserk 2016 and 2017, as if they had Coronavirus. Even as a die-hard fan for most of my life, I hated them."

* In an attempt to avoid mass unemployment, the bill includes funding that would help small businesses cover payroll for eight weeks. This is called the “Paycheck Protection Program.”

* Small businesses could receive up to $10 million each to cover payroll, rent and utilities. The bill aims to cover eight weeks of those costs.

* Each business could receive up to 250 percent of its average monthly payroll.

* This would apply to businesses with fewer than 500 workers, including nonprofits and those who are self-employed.

I fought for a year to see a gi for what my pcp suspects is ibd. I'm currently in a flare. I had to fight to get doctors to stop rescheduling and cancelling on me a year before covid19 was ever a thing. It's been an odyssey. They tried to cancel my phone appointment today yesterday. I spent my lunch hour fighting for it back.  I got it and.....the doctor is just going to taper me off prednisone, into this flare up I'm in', with no other plan of action and no help. She said she didn't think prednisone was ethical re: side effects. I acknowledged that and asked if she had thoroughly considered the side effects of the flare ups I go through that I now am unable to manage without emergency room and hospital treatment. Of me waking up every hour crying in pain. Of the blood. Is that more ethical than prednisone?

She said it was no longer a productive conversation. So. Her hands are clean, I guess. But she isn't the one waking up in the middle of the night with rectal and abdominal pain. 

Honestly I'm done. I don't think I have a lot of fight left in me, and when I'm gone I sincerely hope that every doctor who refused to be the one to see me and also this doctor who thinks unmitigated flareups are worse than medication side effects are cursed with intense mystery abdominal pain and rectal bleeding that makes them dizzy and I also hope they get laughed off and ignored by everyone they ever talk to. Sincerely. I sincerely wish that on them.

What this has to do with the coronavirus: because of covid19 they can't do any diagnostic testing so they have to choose to just kinda shrug their shoulders and watch me suffer, telling me to go to the er if the pain gets bad. Of course conveniently they waited until a pandemic happened to pay any attention to me at all, but that's beside the point."

Some background.  I’m 53.   I’ve been super careful and have pretty much isolated since February.  14 days ago, my GF moved down from Boston to move in with me.  She’s 38 and is the picture of health.  10 days ago was my last contact with anyone outside of her.  I think that’s where I got it.  I had a film shoot and also took that time to do some grocery shopping and go to the pharmacy.   I wore gloves and an N95  throughout it all and stripped and took a long shower as soon as I came back into my house.  

I’ve had a cough on and off for over a week.  Nothing alarming.  Or remarkable.  I smoke.  I also had some nasal congestion.  Normal allergies I figured.  Today, I woke up with a severe headache and slight sore throat that no amount of tylenol will get rid of.  I also am running a slight fever and, yeah, I’m sick.  No cough, no congestion.  Just headache, slight sore throat,  and low grade fever.  

The hospitals here are overrun.  I can’t get in touch with my doctor.  I don’t want to go to the hospital because it’s just a giant petri dish and if I don’t have coronavirus, I’d probably catch it.  I always catch everything. 

Yeah, this is an awful place to put this out there because a large proportion of us are running scared and anxious.  That’s why we are here.  But I needed to write this out and ask...what would you do in my situation?"

Because he was convinced this was some kind of hoax by Democrats to hurt Trump. Because he was so blinded by partisanship that he ignored the multiple, multiple warnings by other countries and the scientific community, at least until March 13th, as evidenced by the meme he posted downplaying the severity of the Covid19 epidemic.

His death is a tragedy, but far more tragic is the prevalence of people so readily willing to ignore scientific evidence, so willing to ignore deaths because they didn't happen in his country, state or community, so willing to follow a leader who has been and continues to be criminally negligent in his management of this crisis that it ends up costing them their lives and most likely the lives of several others in the community.

Testing the Efficacy of Homemade Masks: Would They Protect in an Influenza Pandemic?

The same researcher published instructions on how to make them with the following comment. 

>""It is important to stress, however, that the wearing of face masks will only offer limited protection,"" she wrote, ""and should not be considered sufficient protection. Additional preventative measures need to be adopted.

**Reuters**

Panpimon Wipulakorn, Director-General for the Department of Health for Thailand.

""The droplet from coughing and sneezing is around five microns and we have tested already that cloth masks can protect against droplets bigger than one micron,"" Panpimon said, adding that the masks needed to be washed daily.

**CDC**

>HCP use of homemade masks:
In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.

>When doctors are facing not having PPE, I think they should use whatever they can, and if it is homemade, it’s better than nothing,"" she said. ""This is a life or death matter for them, and any barrier protection like a homemade mask will probably help, but, sadly, the outlook looks grim for the U.S. If the epidemic is spiraling out of control, hospital beds full, and health workers sick (and unable to work) or dead, this is a perfect storm.

'There aren't even that many cases, certainly not enough for most hospitals in the UK to have any problem' is flat-out nonsense, for a start; we've had about 11,500 people test positive for the virus.

The US has about 6.4 times the cases and roughly five times the population, so it's not *vastly* different.) However, that's completely disregarding all of the people who are awaiting tests and who are concerned that they have it and are flooding the 111 line; it's also disregarding the fact that this is an additional burden on top of all the car crashes and cancers and broken bones and manic depressions and general old-person ailments that the NHS already treats. The coronavirus really is a national crisis, and hospitals are feeling the pinch.

But more than that, the NHS is really a national treasure in the UK. It's *very* well-regarded, and even though we occasionally grumble when we have to spend a couple of hours in a hospital waiting room, you'd be hard-pressed to find any British individual who doesn't have a story where the NHS quite literally saved their life or someone close to them. We literally had [a tribute to the NHS when we hosted the Olympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReJjvlipXpM), for God's sake. (Voldemort was there too. It was weird.)

Everyone's acting like the NHS is suddenly super important and NHS workers should be valued because -- get this -- the NHS is *always* super important and NHS workers should be valued. If it helps, you can consider it the British equivalent of thanking soldiers for their service. People are quite literally going above and beyond to save lives, so there's a London Blitz mentality of everyone pulling together and supporting those who are right in the thick of it."

You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa, they can’t even count. No they can’t. They can’t count their votes.

>One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We’re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.

He didn't say the coronavirus was a hoax. He just insisted that concerns (which he attributed to Democrats) that the coronavirus could spread was a ""hoax."" The concerns were correct, he downplayed them. He turned around and claimed the Democrats politicized the issue.

So yes, you're right, he didn't deny the existence of the virus. But I don't think the overall message is that misleading. He *did* think that the virus was no big deal. He praised himself for ""[going] early"" when in reality he did far too little, far too late."

General Motors announces further crisis measures.

General Motors said on Thursday it would suspend production at its North American factories indefinitely, lay off 6,500 salaried employees and cut executive pay, signaling that the automaker believes that coronavirus will take a serious toll on its business.

“We are actively monitoring the situation and the possible impact of the crisis on consumer demand,” a G.M. spokesman, David Barnas, said. “When we can safely resume production, we will.”

G.M. and other automakers shut down their North American plants in the last few days in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus. Most had hoped to restart production next week, but have now scaled back those plans.

Ford Motor aims to restart production at several plants across the United States on April 14, and a plant in Mexico on April 6. Fiat Chrysler said its plants would stay closed until April 14, “dependent upon the various state stay-in-place orders and the readiness of each facility to return to production.” Toyota Motor said its North American plants would remain closed until at least April 17.

The United Automobile Workers union has been pushing G.M., Ford and Fiat Chrysler to keep their plants closed.

“The only guideline in a boardroom should be management asking themselves, ‘Would I send my family — my son or my daughter — into the plant and be 100 percent certain they are safe,’” Rory Gamble, the union’s president, said in a statement.

To cut costs, G.M. said it was suspending development work on some new models. Senior executives will take a pay cut of 5 percent or 10 percent, and defer 20 percent of their salaries to be paid at a later date. The 6,500 salaried put on furlough will receive 75 percent of their normal pay.

Ford has taken similar steps, deferring salaries of its top 300 executives"

The UK should now be able to cope with the spread of the covid-19 virus, according to one of the epidemiologists advising the government.

Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London gave evidence today to the UK’s parliamentary select committee on science and technology as part of an inquiry into the nation’s response to the coronavirus outbreak.

He said that expected increases in National Health Service capacity and ongoing restrictions to people’s movements make him “reasonably confident” the health service can cope when the predicted peak of the epidemic arrives in two or three weeks. UK deaths from the disease are now unlikely to exceed 20,000, he said, and could be much lower.

As for why the mainstream media isn't covering it, that's more of an opinion question. Some would say it's because of the coronavirus, some would say that it's a he/she said situation, some would say it's because the media has been historically pro-biden. 

Personally, I think it's curious that there's no coverage. The accusation is at least as credible as Kavanaugh's accuser and that was immediately reported on, with many publications just assuming guilt. Democrats called for an FBI investigation. The lack of response here, especially considering the stakes are higher, is pretty sketchy.

EDIT: it should also be notes that the accuser seems to have made a lot of pro-russian tweets.The veracity of these claims is very much in the air. 

On a personal note, what gets me is the accusations aren't being investigated. I think an investigation would be important."

But it almost definitely came through bats at some point. It may or may not have moved through some intermediary host animal before jumping to humans, but I hardly think that's real important information for an off the cuff internet conversation. Obviously researchers and whatnot will care very much about the specifics and I'm sure they'll be trying to track the origin more precisely.

Bats are the likely suspect because they are like the poster child for a host species for this kind of thing. They have incredible immune systems that allow them to carry these viruses while not getting sick themselves. 

They're what is known as a reservoir species. And coronavirus strands in particular are rampant in bat populations. 

When a virus makes a jump from host species to humans they call that ""spillover"" and it actually happens fairly often. It's just that a lot of times the new virus either can't really be spread human to human or it's just not really all that harmful. But sometimes something real nasty on all those factors comes together, so now we have this."

>**8 MAY 2015** | GENEVA - WHO today called on scientists, national authorities and the media to follow best practices in naming new human infectious diseases to minimize unnecessary negative effects on nations, economies and people.  
>  
>“In recent years, several new human infectious diseases have emerged. **The use of names such as ‘swine flu’ and ‘Middle East Respiratory Syndrome’ has had unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing certain communities or economic sectors,**” says Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General for Health Security, WHO. “This may seem like a trivial issue to some, but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected. **We’ve seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals. This can have serious consequences for peoples’ lives and livelihoods.**”  
>  
>Diseases are often given common names by people outside of the scientific community. Once disease names are established in common usage through the Internet and social media, they are difficult to change, even if an inappropriate name is being used. Therefore, it is important that whoever first reports on a newly identified human disease uses an appropriate name that is scientifically sound and socially acceptable.  
>  
>**The best practices apply to new** infections, syndromes, and diseases that have never been recognized or reported before in humans, that have potential public health impact, and for which there is no disease name in common usage. **They do not apply to disease names that are already established.**  
>  
>**The best practices state that a disease name should consist of generic descriptive terms, based on the symptoms that the disease causes** (e.g. respiratory disease, neurologic syndrome, watery diarrhoea) and **more specific descriptive terms when robust information is available on how the disease manifests, who it affects, its severity or seasonality** (e.g. progressive, juvenile, severe, winter). **If the pathogen that causes the disease is known, it should be part of the disease name** (e.g. **coronavirus**, influenza virus, salmonella).  
>  
>**Terms that should be avoided in disease names include geographic locations (e.g.** ***Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,*** ***Spanish Flu***, ***Rift Valley fever***), people’s names (e.g. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Chagas disease), species of animal or food (e.g. swine flu, bird flu, monkey pox), **cultural, population, industry or occupational references** (e.g. legionnaires), and terms that incite undue fear (e.g. unknown, fatal, epidemic).  
>  
>WHO developed the best practices for naming new human infectious diseases in close collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and in consultation with experts leading the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).  
>  
>The new best practices do not replace the existing ICD system, but rather provide an interim solution prior to the assignment of a final ICD disease name. As these best practices only apply to disease names for common usage, they also do not affect the work of existing international authoritative bodies responsible for scientific taxonomy and nomenclature of microorganisms."

In the beginning stages of the virus (back when it was mainly Wuhan), I was ignorant of the probability of it ever coming over and causing damage to the States. As a 22-year-old, my mindset has always been ""Nothing bad will ever happen to me."" What we're going through now was something I strongly believed only happened in movies. I was one of the many who told themselves, ""It's just the flu. It's not a big deal. It's just all overblown-media garb."" As the weeks passed, my mindset slowly began shifting.   


""Man, China is getting hammered. If it ever came over here, it will NEVER be that bad.""   
""It's over here in the States? Surely we'll have it covered and taken care of.""   
""The virus is spreading? Well, sure it is. People travel all the time. The flu travels as well.""   
""Now Italy is getting demolished. As sad as that is, it could never happen in America... right?""   
""Okay, well. If this virus starts blowing up, it'll slow down by the summer months.""   
""West Virginia is the only state without a case? What're they doing differently?""   
""Oh, the summer months won't slow it down? It might actually make it stronger? Oh.""   
""At least we'll have a vaccine ready soon. I trust our doctors and scientist.""   
""West Virginia just received their first case? Shit.""   
""The vaccine won't be ready for another 12-18 months? Really?""   
""Is the death toll... rising?""   
""Yeah, the number of cases will go up. We're FINALLY testing more.""   
""New York is getting hammered now? What the...?""   
""We're now leading in cases globally?""   
""What the fuck?""   
""Shit.""   


For days, I'd skim through this sub looking for the good news. Nothing else. The more I did that, the more I realized I'm filling myself with a false sense of hope. Yes, it's great we're creating more ventilators. It's amazing that we're using 3D-Printers to create PPE and whatnot. It's always nice to see we're using new drugs/treatments to fight off the virus. It's also great to know in the future we'll have a vaccine for the virus.   


But that's where my optimism ends.   


We're only in the embryonic stages of the coronavirus. The ""peak"" was projected to be 2-3 weeks, but I'd say it's closer to 2-3 MONTHS. With the number of cases and deaths rising more and more each day, the cold, hard reality sets in - This will be one of the worst things we've ever faced as a country, as well as a world. Hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions will die because of the virus. This is like nothing we've ever seen before. For starters, the majority of the infected will never know they were infected. So, while they were out-and-about in public places, they were unknowingly spreading it. Secondly, we as a country were not prepared for this. We were given a month or two notice, but failed to take proper action. We are now seeing the consequences, and we will continue to see them for awhile.   


In a sense, you could claim this as World War III: The World v. SARS-CoV-2.  Doctors and scientists from all countries are trying their best to create, test, and serve out a vaccine - or maybe even a cure - as fast as they can. While the light at the end of the tunnel is distant, we are hopefully seeing little sparks in the midst of darkness. When all is said and done with this war, perhaps we will see new alliances formed. We will hopefully see a drastic increase in germophobia; people will be more self-conscious.   


Much like 9/11, Covid-19 is going to be something we all remember as a tragic event. It will be read in history books, turned into bio-pics, and will ultimately teach us a lesson. The lesson with 9/11 was that we weren't cautious enough about terrorism. As a result, airports are crowded with security. The lesson for what we're going through now is that we need to be more prepared for pandemic emergencies and not underplay the potential situation. As a result, we'll be stronger than a pandemic. Not just as a country, but as a world."

>**8 MAY 2015** | GENEVA - WHO today called on scientists, national authorities and the media to follow best practices in naming new human infectious diseases to minimize unnecessary negative effects on nations, economies and people.  
>	
>“In recent years, several new human infectious diseases have emerged. **The use of names such as ‘swine flu’ and ‘Middle East Respiratory Syndrome’ has had unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing certain communities or economic sectors,**” says Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General for Health Security, WHO. “This may seem like a trivial issue to some, but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected. **We’ve seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals. This can have serious consequences for peoples’ lives and livelihoods.**”  
> 	>Diseases are often given common names by people outside of the scientific community. Once disease names are established in common usage through the Internet and social media, they are difficult to change, even if an inappropriate name is being used. Therefore, it is important that whoever first reports on a newly identified human disease uses an appropriate name that is scientifically sound and socially acceptable.  
>  	**The best practices apply to new** infections, syndromes, and diseases that have never been recognized or reported before in humans, that have potential public health impact, and for which there is no disease name in common usage. **They do not apply to disease names that are already established.**  
>  
	*The best practices state that a disease name should consist of generic descriptive terms, based on the symptoms that the disease causes** (e.g. respiratory disease, neurologic syndrome, watery diarrhoea) and **more specific descriptive terms when robust information is available on how the disease manifests, who it affects, its severity or seasonality** (e.g. progressive, juvenile, severe, winter). **If the pathogen that causes the disease is known, it should be part of the disease name** (e.g. **coronavirus**, influenza virus, salmonella).  
>  
>	Terms that should be avoided in disease names include geographic locations (e.g.** ***Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,*** ***Spanish Flu***, ***Rift Valley fever***), people’s names (e.g. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Chagas disease), species of animal or food (e.g. swine flu, bird flu, monkey pox), **cultural, population, industry or occupational references** (e.g. legionnaires), and terms that incite undue fear (e.g. unknown, fatal, epidemic).  
>  
>W	 developed the best practices for naming new human infectious diseases in close collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and in consultation with experts leading the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).  
>  
>Th	new best practices do not replace the existing ICD system, but rather provide an interim solution prior to the assignment of a final ICD disease name. As these best practices only apply to disease names for common usage, they also do not affect the work of existing international authoritative bodies responsible for scientific taxonomy and nomenclature of microorganisms."

Food for thought, and I think it’s a fair point. Essentially, based off certain municipalities and groups that have tested their entire populations’ disease prevalence in the 2-3% range, the actual fatality rate may be an order of magnitude or two lower than the 1-3% estimates we’ve seen based on deaths/confirmed positives. Testing has been so limited that the actual number of deaths could be 10 to 100 times less than the 2 million-type estimates that have been thrown around for the US."

(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve’s balance sheet rocketed past $5 trillion in assets for the first time this week as it scooped up bonds and extended loans to banks, mutual funds and other central banks in its unprecedented effort to backstop the economy in the face of the global coronavirus pandemic.

The Fed’s total balance sheet size exploded by more than half a trillion dollars in a single week, roughly twice the pace of the next-largest weekly expansion in the financial crisis in October 2008.

https://www.nytimes.com./2020/01/27/opinion/china-wuhan-virus-quarantine.html

“China’s health authorities will probably eventually argue that there would have been many more cases had they not locked down cities. But that claim is a negative that cannot be proved. And in my opinion, at this stage, the quarantines decreed by the Chinese government will not help end the crisis.

More often than not, health officials are several steps behind a spreading epidemic. And when they aren’t, the history books show, they tend to act too fast (costing a fortune) or unfairly (discriminating against some populations).

Early during an epidemic, it may seem reasonable to try to contain it by imposing social-distancing measures as quickly as possible and then release the throttle if evidence suggests those may be overkill. Incremental restrictions, enforced steadily and transparently, tend to work far better than draconian measures, particularly at enlisting the public’s cooperation, which is especially important for properly handling outbreaks in our interconnected, globalized world.

Today, China is adopting classic quarantine measures but on a scale never before seen, let alone studied. Its reaction is perhaps understandable, given the searing memory of the SARS epidemic of 2002-3 and the criticism that was directed at the government for its early attempts to conceal or minimize the extent of the disease. But it may now be overreacting, and after the coronavirus epidemic’s inflection point, imposing an unjustifiable burden on the population.”"

I've read some news outlet articles regarding the coronavirus situation in Russia, and only CNN and BBC had really unbiased opinions. People on Twitter are questioning how our numbers are so low and suspecting that our ""dictatorship"" is deliberately hiding the actual numbers. And while overall Russia is far from perfect and our public health institutions are understaffed and lack the proper funding we're actually doing fine so far.

First of all, the mayor of Moscow said that the actual number of cases is way greater than the official tally since a lot of people are untested and may not know that they are infected in the first place. He said that during the briefing with president just a day ago, so it is not like anyone is hiding anything: we really don't know the actual number and no one is over-optimistic about it. On contrary, hospitals look like they are preparing for a war since the end of January and doctors and nurses are freaking out. That being said we have 40,000 ventilators: 27.3 per 100,000 people. 3.3 times more than Italy had and 1.5 times more than USA. Even 124 extracorporeal life support units are on standby, but WHO recommends them as the last resort option. We also have an insane problem with rampant tuberculosis, and considering our climate pneumonia is pretty frequent, so even rural hospitals have a lot of experience dealing with respiratory failures.

Another major fact that people are completely missing is that we have pretty close ties with China and a very long land border. Our government established a COVID-19 task force in January. Also in January border with China was effectively closed, charter flights cancelled, number of trains and flights were limited and so on. Most of passengers both on airplanes and trains were screened. All regions that had a border with China declared emergency situation. Even Mongolia tightened the borders and introduced screening since all our trains to China are passing through it. Our military started evacuating citizens from China in February and by the end of it the entry of Chinese citizens was banned. Meanwhile, a lot of our companies were sending literally tons of masks to Chinese partners to help them protect the employees. China also helped us a lot by both contributing to test kit research and providing supplies.

I've visited Finland back in January and both Finnish and Russian government were already screening passengers from China with IR scanners in the airports. I had a runny nose and was so afraid that I may end up in quarantine in Finland I ate a ton of paracetamol before flight and landed with temperature of 36.2°C (97.16°F). That was the end of January and while most of the world thought that novel coronavirus was nothing serious, we've already had two confirmed cases and were ramping up testing.

Here is the list of measures introduced just in March:

\- schools are closed

\- most of universities have switched to distance learning

\- all regular and charter international flights are suspended (flights were)

\- Russian embassies and consulates had stopped issuing all types of visas

\- any night clubs, cinemas, children's entertainment centers and so on are asked to suspend activities, all state cultural institutions are closed

\- hookah smoking is banned

\- a week of paid holidays

\- banks have to disable the cash recycling ATMs, and cash is to be stored for 3 days before being redistributed

\- banks were asked to provide at least a month of credit ""holidays""

\- Moscow is preparing for a complete lockdown if the overall situtation will start getting out of hand

&#x200B;

Moscow government is also building a hospital to treat COVID-19 patients just like China did. Another ""brand new"" hospital near the Moscow was repurposed for the same task and is treating most of the confirmed cases. The have about 380 patients in total, 147 with pneumonia and 104 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Most of the patients got there under suspicion that they have coronavirus, but testing did not confirm it. Only 9 patients with COVID-19 are in ICU.

We've developed and produce our own PCR test kits that were verified by WHO and one of those that was developed by VECTOR Institute was field tested in China by the end of January IIRC. Over 185,000 tests were performed since February, 11th. The state wants to reach 10,000 tests a day just for Moscow by the end of March while 25,000 a day is estimated as the ideal number to cover the population of the city. 2 largest networks of private medical test labs made tests available for public for $20 this month and almost all major cities in Russia have at least one lab. The third major network promised to start offering the tests within 30 days. Our officials claim that all our labs are making about 100,000 of test kits a day now, but I can't confirm it. What I'm absolutely sure is that over 100,000 test kits were produced in the first two weeks of March. Though PCR test kit that was developed by Center for Strategic Planning of Ministry of Health was registered on March, 6th, so that 100,000 a day number may be true.

That recent jump in confirmed cases happened because tests finally became freely available. While the test kits were limited in numbers our consumer health ""watchdog"", Rospotrebnadzor, accumulated a list of over 36,000 people that may have the virus since they, for example, were on the flights from Italy sitting next to a person that had a confirmed case. Some of them were considered a high probability and the ones that had no symptoms were put under ""house arrest"" for 14 days. Some of them decided to ignore the request to stay home so police had to chase them regularly. And yeah, face recognition and mobile phone tracking are used to monitor them. The best part is that Rospotrebnadzor sorta lost the flight manifest of one plane and had to track all the people that were on it one by one with the help of the flight carrier.

At least two labs are working on a vaccine including a DNA based one. The most renowned lab, the research center VECTOR, is already testing about six prototypes on mice and expects to prepare it for clinical trials by the end of the year. In Soviet times the VECTOR Institute was a biological warfare research center so they have a solid track record, though I believe CureVac or BioNTech will be the first ones to start clinical trials. We've also just got a green light from Japan to start production of the Avigan, the flu drug that have improved the lung conditions during clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen. Production line is estimated to make 60,000,000 units by the end of the year.

So while overall situation is frightening future is not looking so bleak for Russia. The state officials are expecting a number of confirmed cases to skyrocket while the testing efforts are ramping up, and hospitals are preparing for that. Private companies are donating millions of dollars to fund the fight.

tl;dr While most of the Europe started to actually act upon the pandemic back in February we were already fighting it for a month.

So before I begin, you should know that the terms ""on campus"" versus ""off campus"" aren't literal. On campus (specifically at Berkeley) refers to any housing that is provided by the school, where you would be paying for your housing in the same portal that you pay your tuition and fees. This includes dorms and campus apartments. However, Berkeley is different than other universities in that all of these housing options are located throughout the areas surrounding campus, and not exactly ""on"" campus as the name suggests. Where I live in my current ""off-campus"" apartment is way closer to campus and my classes than my ""on-campus"" dorm was. I just thought I should clarify that terminology otherwise this would be confusing.

Berkeley only guarantees housing for freshmen, and that's true because there aren't enough dorms or on campus apartments such that all 40,000 of us can occupy them at once. However, it is not only the availability of on campus housing that determines why it's only really a freshmen thing for the most part. Most people do want to have a college dorm type experience, as well as the convenience of knowing you have secured housing and roommates before even coming to Berkeley for the first time (which is also helpful for out of state students). After freshmen year, the vast majority of students opt for off campus alternatives, whether it is a house, frat/sorority, co-cop, dorm-style complex (i'll talk about those later), or some independently managed apartment building. Among many reasons for this, it is cheaper. Everyone I know (including myself) pays far less for an off campus apartment than they did for their dorms. This is often true even when comparing a single in a spacious house to a cramped triple in the dorms. And that also means you're getting a living room, kitchen, private bathrooms, and other amenities that the dorms just don't have, for a cheaper price.

However, this is the bay area, so even though they are cheaper options, does not mean they are cheap. The reason why I only have been using the terms ""double"" or ""triple"" is that the only way to afford housing in the bay area (unless you're from an affluent family) is to live with roommates. Usually a lot of them. So don't get too scared if you look at apartments and see 2 bedroom units going for 4-5k/mo, because in all likelihood you will be living with 3-4 other people, and your rent will even out to 1k or less a month.

Of course, housing in the bay area is in low supply and high demand, which explains the prices. Usually, getting off campus housing means scrawling facebook, craigslist, or apartment sites, then visiting them, paying an application fee, signing a lease with your roommates and having your parents cosign, etc. Also, leases typically go for at least a year starting in June, so if you don't plan on being in the bay over summer, you will have to find people to sublet (which is easy due to the high demand) or waste some money. For on campus housing, you simply fill out an online application, they tell you the result, and you decide whether or not to accept it. It runs during the school terms only, so freshmen living in the dorms are only on a \~10 month 'lease'. Keep that in mind if you're trying to divide the room and board costs per month to compare with off-campus apartments.

Despite all that, the pains of searching for and having an off campus apartment are totally worth it. I'll just list out most of the common pros and cons since I've only really detailed a few above.

On campus:

Pros: easy to get (esp for freshmen), comes with meal plan (if you don't cook), good for people who like to be social and dorm life in general, 'free' cleaning of common rooms and bathrooms, laundry on site, you can use your student id to pay for laundry (i fucking hate having to go buy quarters every week), no need to sublet for summer, common spaces can be nice like the gyms and ping pong tables, mail handling and front desk employees, ....

Cons: expensive (especially if you want an option that's not a tiny dorm room), communal bathrooms, random roommates and neighbors, generally louder at night, no more ethernet access (fuck you whoever made that decision), RAs (they are generally chill, but know if you have alcohol and/or any other substances in your room you can get punished for it), banning of appliances (dorms only, but they're lax about checking for them), .......

Off campus:

Pros: generally much cheaper, more spacious, tend to be quieter (depends on your location), better furniture, the option to get faster internet, .....

cons: more logistics to work out (applying, signing lease, subletting if needed), have to do your due diligence to avoid bad management and scammers, having to clean up for yourself, .....

&#x200B;

let me know if you have any other questions, but surely I answered most of them with this wall of text lmao

edit: I didn't actually talk about off campus dorm-style complexes, but my advice is stay away from them. They charge you a lot more money with the only benefit being single person leases, but almost all of them are poorly managed and intended to scam students who aren't able to find a group and lease an apartment."

Out of all these types of cases, majority of survivors end up with permanent lung damage because of the way coronavirus operates. This leads to slightly reduced lung capacity, all the way up to needing oxygen for the foreseeable future.

People should start to think about these things now as opposed to waiting until it’s too late, 3 in the morning and nurses are forced to perform CPR because nobody is answering the phone. We always talk about socializing medicine but quite frankly its quite rare to find someone that didn’t want everything done to keep 90 year old demented grandpa alive. It’s sad, truly. Do no harm you say? Then let these people die in peace. I would not argue against intubation which would be technically part of a DNR but certainly no CPR. I’ve had this discussion many times today. Do the responsible thing and have this discussion with your family now.

This type of upward move though (anything beyond S&P 2700+) still feels very premature though given that several states appear to be on NY's trajectory: NJ, Michigan, Louisiana, California, Mass., among others, and I'm just struggling to imagine that the US will avoid a second wave of infections given we haven't done a full lockdown.

How is the virus going to be eradicated in large parts of the US when there's no lockdown in play? Just tough for me to see unless there's a huge part of the population that's untested but has become immune due to catching it and showing no symptoms.  That's really the only way the bull case works out and we get a full V shaped recovery here.

But you have to be careful buying puts here; I don't think it's really worth trying to short against the tide, right now this rally has steam, and it will until the coronavirus numbers become too dire compared to what markets are hoping happens (some sort of partial re-open of the US by mid-April)."

If you want to pretend that the way it’s tracking is totally fine and it won’t be THAT bad then continue to do so but don’t spread misinformation and bring other people down with you.  

It’s irresponsible to compare a full season of flu deaths with the very beginning of a pandemic that is ALREADY starting to overwhelm healthcare systems around the world.  The coronavirus spreads at a higher rate than the flu, kills at a higher rate than the flu, and hospitalizes at a higher rate than the flu.

&#x200B;

  

**The longtime trombonist Olle Holmquist, 83, is dead.** 

**Holmquist was ill in Alzheimer's when infected with the coronavirus.** 

**""Olle stood no chance when the virus hit him,"" says his nephew Michael Jonsson.**

Olle Holmquist worked as a musician all his life and travelled around the world for his performances. He played the trombone behind Frank Sinatra, Quincy Jones and ABBA, among others. 

At home in Sweden he played, among other things, behind Monica Zetterlund and Tommy Körberg, was part of the Melodifestivalen orchestra and later also in Allsång at Skansen's orchestra.

When Olle Holmquist was infected by the coronavirus at the nursing home he lived in, he was ill with Alzheimer's disease, says Olle's nephew Michael Jonsson. 

\- He had Alzheimer's and lived in a nursing home where they got the coronavirus, and last Saturday Ollle's wife was told he was infected. 

**""He was very generous""** 

Then it went fast. The night of Thursday Olle Holmquist passed away. 

\- It is terrible that this disease affects the weakest in society. Olle was unlucky when the virus hit because he was quite weak. 

Michael Jonsson describes a warm and generous uncle, who stood close to him and was his role model. 

\- He was a kind, polite, courteous and nice person. He had lived his entire life in show business and was obviously characterized by it, says Michael.

Michael tells of an uncle who brought him along at fun recordings and concerts - and who surprised him greatly when Michael practiced driving in his teens. 

\- Imagine not even being 18 years old and practically driving with his dad's Volvo in normal cases, and all of a sudden he came and offered his 400 horsepower sports car for me to drive. 

Olle Holmquist's widow has approved Expressen to publish the article."

Or worse, having your wedding turn into a COVID-19 infection cluster. 

This situation isn't going to be resolved in the next few weeks. I doubt it will even be under control, let alone resolved and the world back to normal.  Europe is definitely not going to be business-as-usual by May.

What if you were to stage an intervention for the bride? You and the other concerned bridesmaids can sit down and express your (incredibly valid and reasonable) concerns. It's not safe to host an event with European guests if they have not been quarantined for at least two weeks before the event. It is not safe for people to catch flights when flights and airports are a hotbed for infection. It doesn't make sense for people who have lost their jobs to lose money on flights and travel expenses for a wedding that could be illegal to hold by the time May rolls around.

This week my country has laid down a rule that weddings can contain a maximum of 5 people (couple, celebrant, witnesses). Italy, Spain and France are on complete lockdown. I recall the US has some strict rules regarding gatherings as well. If the bride doesn't think there's a very good chance similar restrictions will come to Ontario sooner or later, she is in denial. Even IF you, the other bridesmaids and all the other guests commit to being at this wedding, there is a likely chance the wedding will be torn apart by new legal restrictions by May.

Have the intervention. All of you tell your bride you concerns. The bridesmaid who has to cancel her flight should cancel her flight. The bride then has the opportunity to postpone, or to carry on without you. 

She might scream, she might cry, she might kick you all out of the wedding and cut off the friendships. But is it worth keeping her friendship if it means putting you health (and the health of your community) at risk? Would you risk a week or more in the ICU, plus a lifetime of reduced lung capacity, just to be a good friend? Hopefully she hears all your fears and realises that this situation IS that bad and she can't just stick her head in the sand. If she doesn't, and cuts you off as friends, then nothing of value was lost. 

The odds of this wedding going ahead as planned in May, and you all being overly-cautious fools, are INCREDIBLY slim. Even if coronavirus doesn't destroy the wedding, incoming travel, hospitality and social-distancing restrictions will."

> Since its emergence and detection in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to nearly every country around the world, resulting in hundreds of thousands of infections to date. The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence for widespread, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the U.S. and highlights the critical need for local surveillance."

1) CA Bay Area went to shelter in place on March 16th. NYC shutdown non-essential businesses March 22nd. Cuomo FOUGHT the mayor of NYC not to shelter in place, then essentially enacted the equivalent a week later. 

2) CA had roughly the same coronavirus cases than NY two weeks ago, now NY has 10x the infections and more deaths in a single day than California has since this started. 

The reality is that Cuomo failed to act and that Newsom and CA should be applauded for the seriousness and the speed they took to resolve. While Cuomo is preparing a PowerPoint and his soothing voice, he isn’t taking the actions needed to save lives and that is where the buck stops.

Сада је 23000. Ако се та експоненцијална стопа раста настави биће скоро 1500000 (милион и петсто хиљада) мртвих за месец ипо дана.

Ево да ти напишем ако не верујеш рачуници:

23000 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 23000 x 64 = 1472000

Мање више исти образац је за број оболелих, дакле 30 милиона у наредних 6 недеља.

ОВО НИЈЕ ГРИП! Око 10 пута је смртноснији од грипа! Период инкубације је дужи па се лакше шири од грипа.

НЕ УМИРУ САМО СТАРИ ЉУДИ! Пола људи у критичном стању у неким западним државама је млађе од 60 година. Према подацима мисије СЗО која је посетила Вухан смртност је 3.4%.  Чак и за људе од 20-30 година је смртност 5-10 већа него код грипа. Велики број људи преко 40 или 50 година има неки фактор ризика - гојазност, висок пристисак, кардиоваскуларне проблеме.

Заборавио сам да споменем, око 5% оболелих захтева интензивну него, значи на тих 30 милиона у наредних месец ипо дана то је милион ипо људи. Нигде нема тог броја респиратора!

Sorry that I can't find a version without an ad.

In addition, people are posting links to this new [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2763787?guestAccessKey=39d64ff4-cadb-4cbf-a8af-a36401f80ccb&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=032620) that isn't ruling out vertical transmission to the baby in utero. Some quotations of interest:

""Thirty-three neonates born to mothers with COVID-19, including 3 neonates with COVID-19."" On the most severe of the three, the authors write: ""Patient 3 was born at 31 weeks’ and 2 days’ gestation by cesarean delivery because of fetal distress and confirmed maternal COVID-19 pneumonia. Resuscitation was required. The infant’s Apgar scores were 3, 4, and 5 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes after birth. Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia confirmed by chest radiographic image on admission resolved on day 14 of life after treatment with noninvasive ventilation, caffeine, and antibiotics. He also had suspected sepsis.""

The authors don't rule out sepsis, prematurity, etc. as the cause of this baby's struggles instead of COVID-19, which speaks to your point about the confounding factors of other potential causes. But 9 weeks is very early, and it appears that was done both due to fetal distress and mom's pneumonia distress. Not comforting at all.

If you read the actual studies from SARS and MERS, they are scaaary in terms of pregnancy outcomes. Unclear as of yet how similar this is.  But to me, even that initial COVID-19 study of the 9 women out of Wuhan wasn't that comforting due to all the indications of fetal distress. 

I think you're absolutely right that the media has been very quick to say pregnant women shouldn't be worried. We can only really get a better picture of this with more data, and I fear that picture may indeed be bleaker.

And scariest of all is that...*we are the data*."

This is a long one so bear with me here.

>  Flowey is treated as being insane for his ""Kill or Be Killed"" philosophy, but he is completely right.

He is not right because he is literally sociopathic and only came to such a conclusion after exhausting  every single possibility. He even said he made several timelines where everyone is happy, but aborted them because he got *bored*.

Flowey's powers and the medium of the story are very important to the themes of the game.

> Every monster attacks you unprovoked

For many monsters, their ""attacks"" are how they interact with anyone else. It only hurts Frisk because he is human. Most monsters do not know that Frisk is human, and even then they know nothing about *humans*. If someone unknowingly gave you the coronavirus, I'm pretty sure you do not have the right to *fucking murder them*.

Even if you don't accept the context,  even a lot of the attacks aren't attacks. Aaron the buff mermaid guy is literally just flexing. One enemy doesn't even attack you. Period. And you always, *always* have the option to run away. 

> and you are meant to take it

Again, you're not ""meant to take it"". You can dodge them. You can run away. You can spare them. You have a lot of options. Another theme of *Undertale*. 

You know that in real life that self-defense clauses don't apply if  the perceived threat does not match the response (i.e. you can't shoot a person for pushing you)? That it's illegal or at least morally wrong to shoot a fleeing aggressor?

> Toriel is a kind creature, but she still tries to keep you with her forever.

She tries but she fails. She either accepts being killed by you (ironically by doing this you validate every reason why she tries to stop you) or you can spare her. If you're at low enough health, she will go out of her way to not hurt you.

> Papyrus is probably the nicest guy in the game, but he is still aspiring to become a killing machine. 

Papyrus is *almost* too stupid to understand what he's doing. Again, most monsters do not realize the damage they can do. 

Also, under **no circumstances** can Papyrus kill you. If your health drops low enough, the battle ends before your death, and he takes you to your cardboard prison. He'll fight you again but the same thing applies. Also you don't even have to do anything but survive to get him to stop fighting altogether.

>  Sans doesn't give a fuck about anything until it is too late.

First of all, it's not too late, everything he does is with the sort-of knowledge that you have the power to undo what you do. In the Genocide route, he only attacks you when you're literally going out of your way to kill people. In every other route, he is doing exactly what you want monsters to do: *not attack you and be nice to you*. In fact, Sans said he entertained the idea of killing you when first left the Ruins but he believes that being nicer to you would be more helpful. Is he wrong? 

> Alphys is a liar with a hero syndrome. Mettaton tried to kill you seeking glory.

These two I agree with, and Mettaton is one of the few monsters with a legitimate killing intent. But in Alphys' case, nothing she does would warrant killing her, and you can't anyway.

> Asgore has coffins of dead children in his basement, and is just chill about it.

Okay have you actually played this game or what

Also he is only killing kids (mind you that even Frisk, a child, has the potential to kill *literally everyone* just by WANTING TO) because he wants to liberate his people from terrible conditions that the humans forced them into in the first place. The Underground is only a fraction of the monster population that once was. Why is it okay for you to kill dozens of people to save your own ass, but Asgore can't kill a few people to save hundreds?

And yes, it must be said that Asgore is farthest from ""being chill"" about killing children. 

> All the other characters never have to learn from their mistakes.

Yes they do. Yes they do. What? Yes they do. If their mistakes is trying to kill you, then they fixed them by not trying to kill you.

> Where were Toriel, or Sans or Papyrus, all of whom seem to be fairly reasonable and responsible, to help out the child on their perilous journey?

In the Pacifist route she steps in to stop Asgore from fighting, and if it wasn't for Flowey the entire game would have a happy ending.

Sans and Papyrus help you several times after Snowden. Again, have you really played the game?

> Why is nobody mentioning Undyne's blood lust or Asgore's little basement graveyard?

Seriously, I want to know if you even touched this game. Like you know the characters' names and the plot and the themes but you also think that ""no one mentioned Asgore killing children"" when that is literally why Toriel, his fucking wife, left him, and explicitly why Toriel *doesn't want you to leave*.

Also for all you go on about Asgore, he is the one character you are *allowed* to kill. You *have* to kill him in one loop to get the good ending (though *you* don't actually kill him, you set it up so he can be killed).

> Lets not forget all the monsters that are solely focused on killing you. The game just glosses over it

No it doesn't arrarrrrgh

> Undyne passed out from the heat. Up to that point she tried to impale a child with a spear.

So let's talk about Undyne. Yes, she is one of the few character who actually tries to kill you. This is because she believes that humans are monsters. Not a literal monster, but you get what I mean. On top of that she knows that if she kills you then the monsters are able to leave the Underground. Finally, if you actually *did* kill anyone, she has a point. Again, why should you be able to kill whomever you want, despite the fact that you are fully aware that you are able to undo and restart and avoid this, but she isn't allowed to kill you for killing her people?

But regardless, Undyne stops trying to kill you because you save her life. It's actually a railroaded decision because I don't think you can progress until you give her water, but you do save her, and she does not bother you for the rest of the timeline.

>  Mad dummy got attacked by Napstablook and left. Talking meant nothing to him, only after getting a taste of his own medicine did he back down. Violence is the only language that psycho understood.

Yeah? Mad Dummy's an asshole? The game treats him as an asshole? You do not have the choice to not fight him. So yeah, the game does acknowledge self-defense as valid. What's the point here?

> Muffet decided to spare you only after realizing that you are innocent.

Oh, so now you have the problem with trying to kill others because you think they're hostile? Really now.

> Flowey survives because you let him live. 

Flowey survives **because everyone comes back when you reset**. You can kill Flowey at the end of a Neutral Route and he'll come back on the reset because he is not immune to this. He only has the ability to remember, so that might be why you think he survives. But you can kill him in cold blood and that will change absolutely nothing because you can and will turn back the clock.

Which, as I said in the beginning, is a core part of the game's themes. Yes, in real life, you die, you die, you kill, you kill. In *Undertale*, though, you can always reset.  There is no circumstance in which you *have* to kill, because you can always reset. This is also, above all else, why Flowey's wrong. He has the same ability. He has no excuse. He killed because *he liked killing*. If you kill, and you choose to continue to kill, then you are as bad. *Because you can always undo those deaths*. You can't treat this like a real life situation, because in real life, it's likely that a fucking *child* doesn't have the choice to spare or even *kill*. But this is a game. You can do anything. So why do you kill? 

Even with all that, the game doesn't admonish you for killing. You can't get the best ending if you kill a single person, but then how is it going to be a good ending if everyone isn't there to see it? But you do get the neutral ending, which can still be okay. Frisk leaves the Underground and while the monsters will likely never leave themselves, they can make it better. It's only when you go out of your way to kill is when the game treats you as a monster."

Zoom Video, which provides videoconferencing services and trades under the ticker symbol ""ZM,"" is a key component for many businesses shifting to remote work during the coronavirus pandemic. That's led to the company, which went public last year, to see a surge in users and stock price rise of more than 112% this year so far -- a rarity in the current coronavirus-induced down market. It's now got a market cap north of $40 billion. However, traders have also bid up the much smaller Zoom Technologies, which has the ticker symbol ""ZOOM.""

Mindfulness, CBT, ACT and DBT all work quite well in such cases! **You need to consciously work on your mental health and stress management!**

It's important to understand what you can control vs what you can't! For example, you can't control the global pandemic but you can control your response to it! :-)

In Spain is the same around Madrid as in USA they have 83K cases and almost 38K in just NY.

So far we saw that this damn thing spread mostly in few places but badly while the majority of the territory stays in a ""relative"" control or anyway limited spread.

This is bad because you see most of cases concentrated in just once place, and that's unsustainable for the health system, but it's also """"good"""" because we didn't saw a devastating spread in all the states."

Jeff Kaufman examines some articles criticized for having non-expert authors, concludes that these articles were exactly right, and further argues that the armchair epidemiologists have been doing better than the government and policymakers in terms of actionable advice that involved more than planning for the next couple of weeks.

People are writing a lot about the coronavirus, and I've seen a lot of pushback on how pieces often haven't been written by people with epidemiology or public health credentials. For example, Flatten the Curve of Armchair Epidemiology, Listen To Actual Experts On Coronavirus, and comments like this one.

horrible link because most others are paywall/etc, but the overall number of staff infected vs everyone else is fucking absurd.

In the next months everywhere could see their medical personnel being severely  hit. You'll have those who need hospitalisation themselves, ventilators, those who recover it's seeming can have fairly severe lung damage and will likely need weeks to recover before returning to work. Many of the not severe cases still have enough fatigue that they'll be out for 3-4 weeks. In places we could be looking at 20-30% of staff unable to work at a given time, maybe worse. 

The medical community is going to be hit absurdly hard, it's going to take an age to recover and just the lasting effects of losing so many patients is going to be a huge problem. 

Not being ready for a pandemic and having PPE ready in large stockpiles is crippling the early response and this thing is going to go LLLOOOONNNNGGG yet you seem to have Trump and his cronies banking on this magically ending and refuse to take action to force companies to produce it quickly.

Most of the cases are asymptomatic or mild and right now they are only testing serious cases because there are so few tests.

The total US death toll, since the virus started, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Tracker, was 1,000. https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html

The US has a population of 327 million.

When I divided the death toll by the total population, I got 3x10^-6. A number so low it needed scientific notation.

Look, I get it. Death is sad. I've lost many people in my life, and it hurts to this day. But sadly it's part of life and one of the only guarantees of it.

At some point the US and the world is going to have to get out and moving again. Even if the virus is completely eradicated, people might still be afraid. So my point is is that individuals, communities and nations need to come to terms with this fear and face it, eventually.

We need to take measures to slow things down, for sure, but it can't be forever, or for a long period of time. We'll have to accept that we can't live in fear."

My partner works at a site with known cases.  His incubation was 5 days, mine was 5 days from him getting home (he works away), which was a day before he had symptoms.  He’s day 6 now and I’m day 3.

I like to think I’m pretty rational, and I know this is a sample size of 2, but there are distinctive features that make me confident it’s coronavirus.  The cough (which came before the fever) is unusual.  It felt as though there was something like sand or ants in the voice box.  Onset of cough is rapid, as was the fever about 18 hours later.  My partner slept for 15 hours on day 3, he’s getting up again now, but has still had 10 hours today.  On Day 4 his sense of taste suddenly went, this was before we’d seen anything reported about this.  I’m waiting for my fever to pass, and to see if I have the same symptom.  I’m still in bed.  We’ve both got joint pains and our lungs ache, although the cough is now intermittent.  

I’m telling friends it’s a flu-level illness, it’s not one of those drawn out colds-that-turn-into-bronchitis things where everyone wishes you weren’t dragging yourself in to work.  We went from normal to not being able to get out of bed within 12 hours.  It’s also not a head cold that includes a high temperature and dry cough.  Those are the primary symptoms.

What I find frightening is that the day before onset there was no hint of illness.  My partner went to the bank, got some bits of shopping and filled up with fuel.  Of course he was hand washing and observing the distancing rules, but he was also breathing.

Of course the thought that some people are asymptomatic is the really frightening thing.

The bright side is that we’re healthy, and paracetamol and fluids are helping with the fever and aches.  And we’re about to become an asset, assuming that we are developing immunity.

Now it’s nap time."

CoronaVirus doesn't like heat.  Get hot food, don't eat it in the packaging - pour it out into a clean dish or bowl at home.  Then throw all packaging away, and wash your hands before you eat (20 seconds of hard, soapy scrubbing).

As someone already mentioned - you can heat the food again in your microwave to protect against 'food worker' contamination (if any).

\- High virus load (which would happen in hospitals with too much patients)

\- Not enough care (because not enough healthcare workers, or they are too tired)

\- Comorbidities

\- Bad luck (there are always those statistical anomaly, young, healthy who die. It happens every day, even without Coronavirus).

&#x200B;

Which means that, as long as you provide good healthcare with sufficient room for patients, the epidemic will be bad but without too much fatalities.

&#x200B;

Now, take very crowded and polluted cities. The virus load is already high (because of crowd everywhere). People are already fragile (because of pollution). Pollution seems to be an aggravating factor because it looks like the virus could live attached to microparticules. Increasing virus load.

Not surprisingly, hospitals from big cities are also the first to be crowded: they usually have smaller rooms that hospitals outside the cities, they are more easily at saturation.

&#x200B;

And then, once you pull the trigger: more acute cases, more virus in the air in the hospitals, less care for the patients, more dead, which means more stress on the whole system."

Coronaviruses are RNA based though, so you’re right about that. However, coronaviruses do posses correction mechanisms for replication errors [[source](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/2/E162)]. In fact as stated in my source, a characteristic property of a coronavirus is a low mutation rate.

I actually haven’t read the source for the mutation of the coronavirus you mention, so my next argument might not be completely relevant. But the mutations might just be point mutations. Those mutations could show differences in origin for example, but doesn’t necessarily mean that the viral mechanism differs or that they have any effect on the virus at all.

Other sicknesses (like the flu) must have had their spread slowed along with the Coronavirus.  Automobile accidents should be way down, if everyone is staying home.

Then again, if hospitals are overwhelmed by coronavirus patients, any other medical emergency becomes more lethal too.  There's probably a lot of collateral damage that's not being reported as such."

You can add it all up, but the top ten states add up to about 320,000 tests *total* over the whole outbreak. A full third of that is NY alone. The total for the whole US isn't even 500,000.

The only reason to test that few is if they're using virtually every test they have. Lack of testing is screwing everyone involved. 

They're not sitting on 4.5 million unused tests (which were how many Pence claimed we'd have by the 13th) -- the million he claimed were already out and another 4 million by the 13th. They didn't go anywhere. *They were never made*. The US rejected the WHO tests, losts weeks screwing around making our own, banned private labs from testing for it, and now simply cannot produce enough. The WH just lied about it.

The number of tests being produced is also something that keeps getting brought up in his press conferences and is *never addressed nor answered*."

We aren't in a situation where we can afford to merely ""react"".  Even if this isn't yet to the total annual fatality count of the flu, that doesn't mean it's less serious than the flu and should just be treated as if it were the flu.  That's stupidity.  Yet that's how they are viewing it.  They have no foresight whatsoever.

In addition, I'm sensing a pattern to how these people view any looming crisis.  As I said, they don't seem capable of foresight, so projecting a range of outcomes given what we know is beyond their comprehension.  We see it with climate change, novel coronavirus, and many past threats such as swine flu (which could have been really bad) and even the old ""Year 2000 bug"".  Until they actually see the casualties happen, they don't accept that there is a threat, but the danger in that thinking is clearly that when you DO see those casualties, it's always too late already to do much about it other than to continue to ""react"" which is all these people ever want to do.  They are the worst people to ever have in charge in a crisis, or in my opinion, at any other time either."

By [Chico Harlan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/chico-harlan/) and [Stefano Pitrelli](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/stefano-pitrelli/) March 26, 2020 at 10:33 a.m. PDT

ROME — Italy's nationwide lockdown is showing the first small signs of payoff. The number of coronavirus cases is still rising, but at the lowest day-on-day pace since the outbreak began. The World Health Organization calls the slowdown encouraging. The health chief in the hardest-hit region says there's ""light at the end of the tunnel.""

The temptation, for a cooped-up and stressed-out country, is to embrace the first sign that the crisis may be easing at last.

But while President Trump has talked about [revving up the U.S. economy by Easter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/trump-wants-us-economy-opened-up-and-raring-to-go-by-easter/2020/03/24/dced0a12-6d65-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_4&itid=lk_inline_manual_4), Italy has set no such timetable — and experts say the nation, if it loosens its guard, is still at risk of the virus resuming its extraordinary, deadly trajectory.

Italy was the first Western country to contend with a mass-scale outbreak and order a lockdown. But it is now at the forefront of a more delicate calculation, in trying to figure out how long the restrictions should last.

“If we loosen \[restrictions\] too early, we risk to jeopardize all the results,” said Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan. “My recommendation is: Don’t go after wishful thinking. You have to face the reality” of an extended lockdown.

Officially, Italy’s lockdown — which restricts people’s movement outside their homes and includes the closure of restaurants and retail stores — is supposed to end on April 3. But the government has signaled that the measures will surely be extended, something of little surprise to most people in the country.

As a way to guard against potential restlessness, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said this week that he is increasing fines, from 400 euros to 3,000 (from about $440 to about $3,300 in U.S. currency), for people who left their apartments or houses without a valid reason. Fines are steeper still for people in vehicles who violate the lockdown. People who go outside after testing positive for the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_13&itid=lk_inline_manual_13) could face up to five years in prison.

Conte did not specify how long the lockdown might last, although he batted down rumors in the Italian media that it might be extended through the end of July.

“We are actually confident that, well before this hypothetical deadline, we can truly go back to our life habits,” he said.

 Some virologists say that, rather than an end date, Italy and other countries will have to release the brakes gradually — as China is now trying to do. Still, there are many uncertainties that could influence when to begin letting up the pressure, including whether the virus will wane during hotter and more humid months.

Even the size of Italy’s outbreak is unknown. Government officials and experts have said that, because of limitations on testing, the spread of the virus could be significantly larger than the official data suggest. Andrea Crisanti, a virologist advising the Veneto region, said the country would have to conduct granular testing for the virus — in several geographic areas — to better gauge the true size of the outbreak and then determine more accurately how it is changing.

In the 4½ weeks since Italy experienced the first signs of the outbreak, the country has lost more than 8,000 people to the virus. And even as the total number of documented cases has slowed — reaching 8.3 percent daily growth Thursday — [the toll has been staggering](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/why-is-coronavirus-so-bad-in-italy/2020/03/23/90d306d0-6c85-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_27&itid=lk_inline_manual_27), with 662 people reported dead over the previous 24 hours.

Although most of those deaths have taken place in the north, a nationwide sense of horror has helped with the enforcement of the restrictions. The lockdown has had widespread support: Between 76 and 90 percent approve of the measures, according to various polls.

And although some Italian politicians, such as the mayor of Milan, encouraged people in the early days of the outbreak to stay calm and socialize responsibly, that messaging has stopped cold. Italian politicians have not embraced Trump’s argument that the economic price of fighting the virus may be worse than the virus itself.

The main opposition, the far-right League, has its stronghold in the north, the area hit hardest by the virus. League regional governors in the north have criticized Conte for ordering the lockdown too late, and for initially allowing too many loopholes.

Politically, that means Conte does not face much pressure to relieve the restrictions prematurely. But Italians, under de facto house arrest for more than two weeks, have a natural desire to get back to normal.

“If at the first signs improvement we break ranks, we could have another peak on our hands in two to four weeks,” said Paolo Setti Carraro, an Italian doctor who was also involved in the global response to Ebola.

The temptation to get out of the house at the first chance was evident last weekend in Tokyo, when cherry blossoms were blooming, and [people packed together](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japans-social-distancing-is-shrinking-as-coronavirus-fears-ease-too-soon/2020/03/24/7c816cee-6d0c-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_37&itid=lk_inline_manual_37) in parks and restaurants, dropping the restrictions of social distancing. Japan has had a far smaller outbreak than Italy, but experts there worried that the impulse to socialize as they did before could allow the virus to rapidly spread.

Elsewhere, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan appeared to have controlled the spread of the virus, but they are again experiencing an increase in infections.

“The risk is for the emotional feeling to prevail and to have people say, ‘Things are going better, let’s get rid of all this anguish,’” said Paolo Cruciani, a retired professor of psychology and a former deputy head of the psychologists’ association in Italy’s Lazio region. “Then, boom — the virus comes back. The way to prevent this is a carefully considered mass communication to strengthen their rational vision. It’s a delicate moment: people can’t wait for all of this to end.”"

This is a myth. The virus comes from bats originally, but bats infected another creature that then infected humans. We don't yet know what that middle carrier was, although the pangolin is a possibility. These diseases get passed to humans through open markets, humans and animals living in close proximity, and improper cooking methods -- all things Biblical figures would have dealt with.

Issue 2: The dietary laws were only for Israel, not for any other nation. Jesus declared in Mark 7:18-19 that what defiles us isn't the food we eat, but instead what we dwell on in our hearts. The revocation of the unclean foods is something that happens in the early church, as Jewish believers encounter Gentiles who want to become Christians too. In Acts 10, God uses food to show Peter that Gentiles are welcome. There's even a big discussion about what Levitical law Gentiles must follow, and they are only told not to eat things strangled or with blood (Acts 15). Throughout the Epistles, we are called on not to worry about whether something is clean or unclean but about whether we are thankful for it (Romans 14:20, 1 Cor 10:25, 1 Tim 4:4). This is especially poignant in a missional approach - going into cultures, being all things to everyone so we can by some means gain some.

Issue 3: The comment about how no one should ever eat these types of foods is a very privileged statement. So many people don't have a choice. They are hungry, and the food they can afford is stuff we would consider nasty. We have the money and infrastructure as Americans so that we can enjoy good beef, pork, and chicken without ever having to see the animals our food comes from if we don't want to. So before we judge others about the food they can afford, we should ask what we've done to help alleviate that problem. (Matthew 25:31-46)"

No momento, há um grupo muito forte a favor de até 2 meses de quarentena. 

Esse grupo é composto pela mídia, por profissionais de saúde, cientistas e outras pessoas informadas — de certo modo, uma elite. Também há cidadãos leigos no grupo, a classe deles é desconhecida e deve ser heterogênea. Mas baseado em bairros nobres de São Paulo, do Rio de Janeiro e de Brasília que fizeram fortes panelaços, há uma boa parte desse grupo que é rica (sem meias-palavras).

O grupo pró-isolamento social não aborda as necessidades dos trabalhadores que estão sendo afetados. Diante da gravidade da crise, o grupo insiste que o isolamento tem que ser longo e rígido. Ele busca evidências em todos os cantos pra mostrar como não se está fazendo o suficiente, quer sempre mais. Os trabalhadores mais afetados pelo isolamento não conseguem dialogar com esse grupo porque suas necessidades são caladas, são chamadas de desinformação, são menosprezadas como bolsonarismo.

No meio disso tudo, quem está claramente se posicionando mais ao lado das necessidades mais urgentes dessas pessoas é, infelizmente, o Bolsonaro. Quando ele diz pra seguir vida normal, isso ressoa com muita gente que depende da circulação de pessoas pra ter renda. Cerca de 40% da força de trabalho do país é informal.

A gente não pode continuar alienando esses trabalhadores com o discurso que estamos fazendo. Nos EUA, Trump tem feito algo parecido com o que Bolsonaro está fazendo. Na mesma semana em que o número de pedidos de ""seguro-desemprego"" lá [subiu 1500%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/unemployment-claims-coronavirus-3-million/) (sic), a aprovação de Trump [subiu para 49%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/298313/president-trump-job-approval-rating.aspx). As duas coisas estão mais conectadas do que parecem. Aqui no Brasil, não temos nem notícia do que está se passando.

Percebam que ainda que o Brasil tenha 1 milhão ou 2 milhões de infectados, isso é uma pequena porcentagem dos 200 milhões de brasileiros. Em especial pra quem está perdendo renda e tendo que deixar de pagar contas por causa do isolamento social, COVID-19 é largamente invisível.

A solução, ao meu ver, é mudar um pouco o discurso e passar a dar mais espaço pra discussão de medidas econômicas que aliviem os danos do isolamento. Ideias como renda básica universal, férias com salário garantido, auxílio pra autônomos, abatimento de contas (aluguel, água, luz, internet, gás, condomínio) e outras coisas parecidas **precisam** acompanhar a discussão sobre a urgência da quarentena.

Denunciar os posts polemizantes da Secom, que no momento são as únicas coisas que ressoam com um grupo enorme de trabalhadores afetados, não vai ter o efeito que vocês estão imaginando. Vai parecer o silenciamento de um grupo, o favorecimento da necessidade de alguns sobre a de outros. Se o discurso continuar como está, a própria eficácia do isolamento social fica ameaçada. Precisamos incluir as necessidades desse grupo de trabalhadores."

You should be checked for potential complications, especially if your body is already under stress from the virus. Just like the couple who poisoned themselves with a version of chloroquine phosphate in Arizona, a couple who thought they were able to prevent the disease by taking it, Mayo Clinic people are worried about all the pharmacists and doctors who prescribed it for their families, friends, and staff and who have no idea about the limitations and and actual potential uses of hydroxychloroquine. 

Here are the South Korean guidelines for potential use of the drug as of 2/13:

 **Physicians work out treatment guidelines for coronavirus**

[**http://m.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7428**](http://m.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7428)

 ""The key guidelines are as following; healthy patients with no  existing disease do not need an administration of an antiviral drug,  and, once physicians decide on the use of antiviral treatment, they  should do so as quickly as possible.

The COVID-19 Central Clinical Task Force, composed of physicians and  experts treating the confirmed patients across the nation, held the  sixth video conference and agreed on these and other treatment  principles for patients with COVID-19.

If patients are young, healthy, and have mild symptoms without  underlying conditions, doctors can observe them without antiviral  treatment, according to the guidelines.

If more than 10 days have passed since the onset of the illness and  the symptoms are mild, physicians do not have to start an antiviral  medication, the task force said.

However, if patients are old or have underlying conditions with  serious symptoms, physicians should consider an antiviral treatment. If  they decide to use the antiviral therapy, they should start the  administration as soon as possible, the task force noted.""

 

""As chloroquine is not available in Korea, doctors could consider  hydroxychloroquine 400mg orally per day, they said. There is no evidence  that using lopinavir/ritonavir with chloroquine is more effective than  monotherapies, they added.

Combining lopinavir/ritonavir with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine  could cause serious arrhythmias and drug interactions due to the  increased QT interval, the task force said. Thus, the combination should  be administered cautiously, in a very limited case, it emphasized.

The antiviral treatment for the new coronavirus will be most suitable  for seven to 10 days. Still, the period could be shortened or extended  depending on clinical progress, the doctors said.""

""Concerned that the sudden interest in their use for coronavirus could  cause fatal heart arrhythmias in a small percentage of what could become  millions of users, Mayo Clinic on Wednesday, March 25, issued [urgent guidance](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-provides-urgent-guidance-approach-to-identify-patients-at-risk-of-drug-induced-sudden-cardiac-death-from-use-of-off-label-covid-19-treatments/) advising  cardiac screening of all who take hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine,  malaria drugs touted by President Donald Trump and others as effective  for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19."""
