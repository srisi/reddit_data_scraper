That Dallas nurse who had treated the man who had Ebola had explicitly asked the CDC if she had permission to fly on a commercial plane to a bridal show in another state, knowing she had possibly been exposed to Ebola. They told her that was a-okay, and so she traveled, and later tested positive for Ebola. The CDC publicly slammed her for being so irresponsible and potentially exposing hundreds of people to the virus--until her attorney called them out for giving her the green light to travel. I guess she had proof of them giving her permission (email, I'm guessing?). And even then, they just hand-waived it away like, ""Well, that staff member was wrong.""  

It was at that moment that I realized the CDC cares more about public perception than they do actually preventing the spread of infectious diseases.

You walk through a cloud of viral aerosal. Sure you didn't inhale it but it's all over your body. It can also infect you via the eyes.

Touch your face? You wasted a mask and are now infected.

Most virus in public will have settled on surfaces. You're unlikely to catch by inhalation unless you walk through the same area as an infected person within an hour or so. But covid can remain on surfaces for up to nine days. You're far more likely to expose yourself by touching contaminated surfaces and your face or food.

So wash your hands. Use hand sanitizer. Don't touch your face.

The doctor gave him flu meds and sent him home. Two days after that, feeling worse, he went to the hospital. Doctors decided not to test him, was sent home. He visited the hospital two more times asking to be tested, the last time to the emergency department as he was having trouble breathing. **36 hours after the last visit, he was finally tested and found positive!!** In the meantime, he had **definitely** infected eighteen other people (including his pregnant wife) and possibly more. Those infected went on to infect more which is how it spread in Lombardy and to many other places.

It's not so much that countries aren't properly prepared to handle viral cases but that some doctors in countries with only sporadic or no known infections don't believe someone could be potentially infected. They've dropped the ball. It's only when the (possibly) few initial cases have multiplied that a country will then struggle to contain the spread.

I know test kits can be expensive (and if the poor patient doesn't have to pay). But if all countries were willing to cover the costs, it would end up saving them money compared to the serious economic downturn that's now affecting the world market. ***Spending money will end up saving money -- and more importantly, lives.***"

[This guy](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Drosten) discovered SARS in 2003, and he created the very test that can discover COVID19 that is now used everywhere.

He has a daily 30minute interview with NDR in Germany for the latest updates.

Now, for the relative good news: according to him, the actual fatality rate is about 0.5%, and not 2-3% as quoted everywhere (his estimation is 2 days old).

The reason for that is overestimation is that many cases have slight to no symptoms, and are not regarded into the common case fatality rate because they are not tested. He has more data than we do, and is confident about this.

Still, 0.5% is very high compared to the common influenza epidemics, and combined with a 60-70% infection rate, this would mean 1.5-1.75 million deaths just in the EU."

The mortality rate of untreated HIV is a cold, hard, 100%. HIV mutates incredibly quickly relative to other viruses, which is one thing that has really complicated treatment - resistance to medications develops so quickly that if you’re not using the right combination they can render themselves worthless.

Don’t know how much detail you want but HIV does a couple funny things. All viruses hijack cellular machinery, but HIV goes so far as to integrate its genetic material into your own. That is *very* unique. So you could, in theory, rid someone of every single HIV particle in their body and their T cells will still encode for it... it can then replicate when normal transcription and translation occur.

This becomes a problem because you have memory T cells that hide out, waiting for you to encounter a previously seen antigen. Your memory T cells are why a second infection with a virus tends to be less severe - they wake up and are able to mount a quick response. But that also means that you have a constant reservoir of T cells encoding for HIV if they’ve been infected and integrated."

> Covid-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we’ve been worried about.
> There are two reasons that Covid-19 is such a threat. First, it can kill healthy adults in addition to elderly people with existing health problems. The data so far suggest that the virus has a case fatality risk around 1%; this rate would make it many times more severe than typical seasonal influenza, putting it somewhere between the 1957 influenza pandemic (0.6%) and the 1918 influenza pandemic (2%).
> econd, Covid-19 is transmitted quite efficiently. The average infected person spreads the disease to two or three others — an exponential rate of increase. There is also strong evidence that it can be transmitted by people who are just mildly ill or even presymptomatic.3 That means Covid-19 will be much harder to contain than the Middle East respiratory syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which were spread much less efficiently and only by symptomatic people. In fact, Covid-19 has already caused 10 times as many cases as SARS in a quarter of the time.

Gold - this is all you need to understand to see the risk. Ignore the yapping media."

2020-02-28,fuccman88,Coronavirus,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/faowou/daily_discussion_post_20200228_questions_images/fj1gpi1/,"3 Reasons Why Its Now Really Time to Prep

I'm not going to lie, in January I was kindof trolling and joking with my group of friends and social circle about people blowing things out of proportion on this ncov-19 situation. 

After seeing the markets react, institutions react, the ultra fast spread into Italy and Korea and just generally watching the spread of this virus play out exactly like the movie Contagion, I'm now genuinely scared for the health and safety of all of our parents, grandparents, and all of the new born babies out there. They're the ones with the highest risk and mortality rate. 

Western society is not equipped to handle this kind of epidemic.  

Let me explain using only facts and logic so you can consider the following and decide if it's now time to prep:

1) There's not enough staff or hospital beds in most cities let alone test kits to support and handle a situation like the one in Wuhan.

When I caught Influenza A 4 weeks ago, I waited for 4 hours to be seen. I let the doctors know I travelled recently and they would not test me for ncov-19 until I really put the hammer down even though they agreed that I exhibited all of the symptoms of ncov-19 (less pneumonia) including the incubation timeframe. 

Luckily, I got my test results back confirming influenza A but this shows that there's an inherent human bias by medical staff on testing anyone due to any number of reasons; fear, denial, panic, lack of test kits, who really knows but what is to say that people who have the virus don't slip through the cracks back into the public for this reason. 

This confirms that the process for testing everyone with the possibility of having the virus for the purpose of containment is flawed.

2) I can only speak for the western world, a lot of people, especially those in service industries live paycheck to paycheck or heavily in debt. They can't afford to skip a day of work. So what happens when they get infected with a flu or other virus? Do they stop going to work and quarantine? No. Do they even wear a mask as a courtesy to others around them the people they work with, the people they service? No. They worry more about the social stigma of being judged for wearing a mask. So instead they keep going to work with their minor but contagious symptoms until they are physically unable to work anymore. When asked if they're sick, they just deny, keep a low profile and say they've just got the sniffles. 

The next time you're at a grocery store, really pay attention to how many people are coughing and sneezing and how many of those people are consciously remembering to use an elbow or cover their mouth. How many people wipe their hands off after touching baskets and carts with any number of contagious sicknesses. Do I need to even get into Uber, Taxis or public transportation?

This confirms prevention of spread at this time isn't possible.

3) Major grocery stores only carry around 3 days worth of food at any given time due to the structure of their supply chain. If the general population decides to stock up on 2-4 weeks worth of food and supplies all at once then do the math on how that will work out. 

Stores everywhere are already out of hand sanitizer, antibacterial soap, rubbing alcohol, masks, etc.

This confirms that there will be a drastic shortage of supplies in the event of a major localized pandemic.

In conclusion, if you aren't prepared now, get prepared. If you start when everyone else decides to start by hearing it in an emergency broadcast then you're already too late. The reason you prep is to avoid the stress, panic, and risk to yourself when everyone else is in the same ""wait until last minute"" position. You don't wait until last minute to buy hot concert tickets if you want a chance to see the performance, so why would you wait until last minute to improve your chance of health and safety?

I've always found that the way to get ahead in life with an advantage is to be the black sheep. Do what 90% of the others aren't. Find a clever way to solve a problem. In this case the problem is yours and the only thing that will prevent you from solving your problem is yourself and others with the same problem. To solve your problem you just need to do what the majority haven't done yet and do it before they do. Protect yourself.

Do what you want with the advice. 90% will do nothing. Some will even critique and deny. I know a thing or two about planning, executing, and being prepared so that I can have an advantage. I owe my lifes great success to it."

Full text for anyone paywalled

>Iran’s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, was pale and drenched in sweat during a press conference on Monday as he told reporters that the Islamic Republic had “almost stabilized” the country’s outbreak of coronavirus. He mopped his brow so often that an aide scurried to the lectern with a box of tissues. Harirchi dismissed as hype an Iranian lawmaker’s claim that fifty people had already died from COVID-19. “I will resign if the numbers are even half or a quarter of this,” he said, adding that Iran had only sixty-one confirmed cases, with twelve deaths. Iran opposed quarantines, he said, because they belonged to an era before the First World War—“to the plague, cholera, stuff like that.” The next day, Harirchi confirmed in a video—from quarantine—that he had contracted coronavirus.

>Iran, a country of eighty-three million people, has now become one of the global epicenters of the coronavirus—with the highest mortality rate in the world. Based on official numbers, the mortality rate in Iran has fluctuated daily, between eight and eighteen per cent, compared to three per cent in China and less everywhere else. Iran is also unique, because a disproportionate number of confirmed cases are senior government officials. On Thursday, the Vice-President, Masoumeh Ebtekar—who gained fame in 1979 as Sister Mary, the spokeswoman for the students who seized the U.S. Embassy and took fifty-two Americans hostage—announced that she, too, had contracted the coronavirus. The day before, she had attended a meeting with President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet. Two members of parliament, including the chairman of the Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy, have also been infected, as has the mayor of a district in Tehran and a senior cleric who had served as Iran’s Ambassador to the Vatican. One of the lawmakers, Mahmoud Sadeghi, tweeted on Tuesday, “I send this message in a situation where I have little hope of surviving in this world.” The former Vatican Ambassador, who was eighty-one, died on Thursday. So did Elham Sheikhi, a member of the women’s national soccer team, who was twenty-two.

> Iran’s official counts—three hundred and eighty-eight confirmed cases and thirty-four deaths, as of Friday—may be grossly underreported. In an early analysis published on Monday, six Canadian epidemiologists calculated that Iran probably had more than eighteen thousand cases of coronavirus. Their mathematical model was based on Iran’s official death toll, the disease’s infection and mortality rates worldwide, inflections in other countries traced to Iran, flight data, and travel patterns. “Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size,” they concluded. Because of the wide margin of error, the number of cases could range from as low as thirty-seven hundred to as high as fifty-three thousand. In the end, the Canadian epidemiologists settled on eighteen thousand three hundred, with a ninety-five-per-cent confidence rate. All of their estimates are many, many times higher than the figures that Iran has reported. Their model was published on medRxiv, which posts preliminary research that has not yet been peer-reviewed. 

>Kamiar Alaei, a widely recognized Iranian global health-policy expert who co-founded an innovative H.I.V. clinic in Tehran, also emphasized the tricky and still evolving mathematics of coronavirus contagion. “The mortality rate elsewhere is around one to two per cent, and three per cent in China,” Alaei, who is now a co-president of the Institute for International Health and Education, in Albany, told me. “Iran has announced thirty-four deaths, although some unofficial reports claim it is at least a hundred and thirty-four and even two hundred. So if the death rate is only one per cent, then the total number of cases would be between thirty-four hundred and ten thousand or even twenty thousand.”

>The outbreak appears to have started in Qom, the conservative city of Shiite seminaries run by leading ayatollahs, about two hours from Tehran. It is also home to the Fatima Masumeh shrine—famed for its giant gold dome and intricate blue tilework—which draws pilgrims from all over the world. (For its historic beauty, I visit the shrine complex whenever I go to Qom.) The first mention of the disease by the government was a report of two deaths in the city on February 19th. Initial reports indicate that the carrier of the virus may have been a merchant who travelled between Qom and Wuhan, in China, where COVID-19 is believed to have originated. The outbreak is estimated to have begun between three and six weeks ago, which would mean that the two Iranians who died could have been sick and infecting others for weeks.

>Within eight days of the first reported death in Iran, COVID-19 had spread to twenty-four of the country’s thirty-one provinces. The number of cases has roughly doubled daily since Tuesday. Instead of closing down public sites, a measure that public-health experts have taken in other countries, the head of the shrine in Qom called on pilgrims to keep coming. “We consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing. That means people should come here to heal from spiritual and physical diseases,” Mohammad Saeedi, who is also the representative of Iran’s Supreme Leader in Qom, said in a video. Cases traced back to Iran have been reported in Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Canada, Georgia, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. Many of these cases have been linked specifically to visits to Qom.

No matter the supply of money and demand there is a hard limit for how many chicken sandwiches are available to purchase.

We've got supply chain issues on test kits because they're not manufactured in North America and other countries are using them heavily as well.

'Rights' get messy when scarcity is a consideration. If you can produce or perform thing of your own labor, that's a good example of a right. The right to speech, or self-defense. Go back to the federalist papers and most of the rights in the American Constitution for example are based on what were perceived as 'God given rights' observable in nature, the things that every living thing can do that government should be prevented from intruding on. 

When scarcity is a factor every time the item is provided to a person there is someone else who does not get that thing thus their rights have been tread on. An inherent conflict in distribution because there is not enough for everyone."

The outbreak coincided with two major milestones—the anniversary of Iran’s revolution, on February 11th, and the parliamentary election, on February 21st. “The government didn’t want to acknowledge that they had a coronavirus outbreak because they feared it would impact participation in these two events,” he said. “So for weeks there was a huge silence.” Less than forty-three per cent of Iranian voters turned out for the election, the lowest rate of participation since the 1979 revolution. Both voters and poll workers were photographed wearing masks.

>“It was the political decision that led to this outbreak in Iran,” Alaei said. “It’s very unfortunate, as Iran has a very well-established infrastructure for the health system and well-educated doctors.” Alaei was imprisoned in 2008 for “communicating with the enemy,” running espionage rings, and trying to “launch a velvet revolution” against the government in Tehran. He spent thirty months in the notorious Evin Prison. He moved to the United States after his release.
The coronavirus is also becoming a new flashpoint between Iran and the United States. After the election, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused Iran’s enemies of exaggerating the threat of coronavirus to scare voters away from the polls. “This negative propaganda about the virus began a couple of months ago and grew larger ahead of the election,” he said. “Their media did not miss the tiniest opportunity for dissuading Iranian voters and resorting to the excuse of disease and the virus.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, countered that Iran was lying about “vital details” of the spread of the virus.

>The timing of the epidemic is particularly dire for Iran’s economy. As part of President Trump’s “maximum-pressure campaign,” the U.S. reimposed economic sanctions on Iran—and any foreign company or country that does business with it—in November, 2018. Iran’s economy contracted more than nine per cent last year. Since the coronavirus outbreak began, ten days ago, eleven countries, including major trading partners such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey, have closed their borders to the Islamic Republic, according to Adnan Mazarei, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington. “The entire Middle East region could soon be affected by Iran’s role as an epicenter of this contagion,”
he wrote on Thursday. “The Middle East region will certainly be hit by a new round of downward pressure on oil prices on account of a decline in demand for oil by China and elsewhere,” he added. And China has accounted for a quarter of all Iranian trade.

>Internal commerce is also likely to take a hit on the eve of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, in three weeks. Nowruz is the country’s biggest holiday, and the ritual is to buy new clothes and toys—and to travel to the Caspian coast or other vacation spots to take a break from Iran’s mounting crises. The more that Nowruz celebrations are curtailed, the greater the danger for protests about the epidemic, global isolation, and unanticipated economic setbacks. Two waves of protests have challenged the regime since November.

>Iran took steps this week to check the contagion’s spread. In Tehran’s subways, cars were disinfected and snack shops were shut. In more than a dozen provinces, public venues—college campuses, schools, and cultural centers—were closed. Events drawing large audiences, including soccer games and movie screenings, were postponed. Friday prayers were cancelled in the twenty-four provinces where the virus has appeared. Schools across Iran will be closed for three days, as of Saturday. The Health Ministry has urged people not to shake hands and to avoid crowded places. Social media was filled with parodies—a video of young men on the street shaking their shoes with one another, to avoid shaking hands, and a barber cutting the hair of a customer, who was wearing a mask, with a razor attached to an extender pole. Yet the regime has been fighting the image of a nation crippled by an epidemic as much as it has been fighting the coronavirus itself. Speaking at a national headquarters established to deal with the virus, Rouhani said, “In schools, high schools, universities, and workplaces, everybody should pay attention to health recommendations. But we must all continue our work and activities, because it is one of the enemies’ plots to spread fear in our country and close down the country.”

>The ailing deputy health minister was more candid. “I’m saying this deep from my heart . . . take care of yourselves,” Harirchi said in a
video that he posted from quarantine. “This is a democratic virus, and it doesn’t distinguish between poor and rich, statesman and an ordinary citizen. It may infect a number of people.” In the Islamic Republic, that number may be frighteningly large."

Terrible advice. Stock markets are already tanking before most of the impacts to the physical economy have kicked in. Supply chain disruptions arising from China's restrictions are *just* starting to seriously impact manufacturing outside of China. Consumer spending in the US and EU will plummet as more confirmed cases come out. Japan and South Korea are getting hit hard. We still have a loooooonnngggggg way to go down.

Either you do it to the whole European area, or it's so easy to circumvent the ban will serve no purpose at all. 

2) it's probably safer to allow flights to and from italy right now than most European countries (or even within the US), as they're actually testing like crazy and tracking everyone. Other countries have surely outbreaks, they aren't performing enough tests to find them. A couple of days ago a French teacher not trackable to any epidemic areas has died, and a German man who had been to a carnival in the Netherlands is in critical conditions. Both not linkable to italy in any way, both in positions to spread it to many others. Who knows how many have it, they are not performing the tests..."

Two separate cases of community transmission likely means that there are others in the United States, said Jennifer Nuzzo, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

“I think there’s a strong possibility that there’s local transmission going in California. In other words, the virus is spreading within California, and I think there’s a possibility other states are in the same boat. They just haven’t recognized that yet,” she said.

Little else is known about the case, including the person’s condition and how long the resident was in the community while infectious.

To date, the virus, which originated in Wuhan China, has sickened more than 83,000 people and killed nearly 3,000."

His main point was that it will spread in Germany. New clusters will mushroom in coming weeks. You can’t prepare for it and we waste energy playing the blame game. He compared it to influenza pandemics of 1957 or 1968. He said we haven’t had a similar one since then. Not like normal flu, but like influenza pandemic, very different. Lot of improvisation needed in coming months by health care system and policy makers and all of us.

If cases can be spread out over two years, it will be easier to handle for health care system. Germany is overall in a good spot compared to other countries in terms of resources.
