The big difference is, SARS virus can only be contagious by a person who’s sick and already shows symptoms. That can be detected with more ease and the person can then be swiftly quarantined. The isolation strategy works much more efficiently then. We can also be more alarmed to avoid contact and interaction with people who have those symptoms. However, this new novel coronavirus can be spread by someone who’s asymptomatic and looks pertectly healthy. Temperature screening then becomes a very weak preventive measure and the sick person can blend in into the society with no one biting any suspiciousness. When he/she is isolated, it’s already too late as the virus may have already been spread to others.."

    The longer Beijing enforces curbs on work and travel, the greater the global economic shock

The workshop of the world is closed. China is on a total-war footing. The Communist Party has evoked the ""spirit of 1937"" and mobilised all the instruments of its totalitarian surveillance system to fight both coronavirus, and the truth. Make GDP forecasts if you dare.

As of this week two-thirds of the Chinese economy remains shut. More than 80pc of its manufacturing industry is closed, rising to 90pc for exporters. 

The Chinese economy is 17pc of the world economy and deeply integrated into international supply chains. It was just 4.5pc of world GDP during the SARS epidemic 2003, which some like to use as a reassuring template. You cannot shut down China for long these days without shutting down the world. 

Wednesday's investor euphoria at reports of two new wonder drugs from Zhejiang University show how badly unhinged the market has become. This is not the way that medical science advances. Nor could these anti-virals possibly be ready, in time and at scale, to avert serious economic upheaval.

The open question is whether the coronavirus shock is enough to abort the fragile economic recovery underway since last summer’s near miss, when frightened central bankers in the US, Europe and 47 other jurisdictions cut rates in a drastic monetary U-turn.

Personally, I think the glacial SARS episode tells us little about the fast-spreading Wuhan virus. The 2019-nCoV variant is more akin to the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. It appears to be tracking the 1918 death rate at about 2.3pc (20 times normal winter flu) to the extent that we can believe any figures. There is some evidence that it is nearer 4.9pc in Wuhan.
Coronavirus live map

The difference is that Spanish Flu felled the young, because their immune systems went into overdrive: this virus carries away the old. 

There is no global economic safety margin. Both the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have already relaunched quantitative easing - a bizarre thing to do if the US economy is really doing as well as Donald Trump claimed in his State of the Union address. Clearly US strength is a late-cycle illusion. Exhaustion has been masked by both by a blast of monetary stimulus and a fiscal deficit near 5pc of GDP.

The scale of disruption in China is already staggering. Hyundai, the fifth-biggest global car maker, has been forced to close all its factories at home in Korea for lack of key components. Volkswagen, Toyota, General Motors and Tesla have all downed tools at their Chinese plants, as has Apple’s iPhone supplier Foxconn.

Crude prices have dropped 20pc since early January, that long-ago moment when eight Wuhan doctors were already trying to alert the world to the virus, only to be arrested for “spreading rumours”. 

This is the biggest shock to oil markets since the Lehman crisis. The collapse in Chinese transport and refinery demand has cut imports by three million barrels a day; some say four million. This is twice the UK’s North Sea oil output. An embattled OPEC is having to talk about yet further output cuts, a horrible surprise as the perpetual petro-drought grinds on into its sixth year. 

“It’s now clear that coronavirus is a serious event risk to the entire world and that financial conditions are tightening very quickly,” said Edward Harrison from Credit Writedowns.

The channel of financial contagion runs from the epidemic through the oil price to a “bear market rout” in the broader energy sector, and from there to overstretched US junk bonds. “High yield is where the rubber hits the road,” he said.

The coronavirus is the sort of Black Swan catalyst that the US Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) frets about. Its latest stability report said corporate bonds are an accident waiting for such a trigger. The ratio of junk bonds with debt-to-earnings ratios above six has reached 30pc, above the pre-Lehman peak.

The number of investment-grade securities rated BBB or lower has risen fivefold since 2008, many perched just above junk. If fear takes hold there is likely to be a cascade of downgrades and ""fallen angels"", setting off a fire-sale by bond funds.

Commodity markets have taken the crisis on the chin because they are instant barometers of actual demand. Equity markets are instead shrugging off the Wuhan virus as media noise, betting that China’s factories will reopen on February 14 or thereabouts as Beijing brings the epidemic under control. 

This is a brave assumption and I can only marvel at analysts suggesting that the infection rate may be tailing off based on each day’s official data. Are they aware of the astonishing accounts of Kafkaesque reality in Wuhan, Huanggang, and soon no doubt the 35m-strong megalopolis of Chongqing, where Britain has just closed its consulate? 

Are they reading dispatches from Caixin or in the South China Morning Post revealing a desperate shortage of testing kits and tales of the walking afflicted (transport has been shut down) queuing for hours at hospitals, only to be turned away and sent home to die undiagnosed. 

These glimpses of truth are about to vanish. The propaganda police have ordered those within their direct reach to conduct an “editorial review”. Stories are being censored aggressively. Outsiders will be silenced in subtler ways.

The coronavirus numbers are patently fiction:
The number of coronavirus cases continues to skyrocket

Far more have died than the official tally of 493. A Lancet study last week by the University of Hong Kong estimated that the Chinese authorities have understated the epidemic tenfold. This was based on a spread rate of 2.68 per case and a doubling in total numbers every 6.4 days, matched with known travel movements within China and globally since the outbreak. 

It calculated even then that the true figure for Wuhan was likely to be 76,000, and that Chongqing,  Changsha, Nanchang, are already riddled with the disease. “Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable,” it said.

Views differ but it is striking how many global experts – when not under political pressure – say it may already be too late to stop the spread. “It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” says Anthony Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. 

It is the same warning from an “increasingly alarmed” Peter Piot, head of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The danger is that it will become endemic and circulate everywhere like flu, a manageable headwind for rich countries with good health care but a Sword of Damocles having over Africa or South Asia.
Economic Intelligence newsletter SUBSCRIBER (article)

There is an inherent contradiction in the market’s nonchalance. Yes, it is possible that China’s 50 million lockdown and use of extreme surveillance and coercive power will accelerate the process of “contact tracking”, catching enough of those infected before they can spread it further. Such a hi-tech totalitarian response to an epidemic has never been tried before.

But the more thoroughly China enforces this, the greater the global economic shock is likely to be. How can industrial plants really be reopened next week? Yet if it takes another month, it becomes progressively harder to contain the international economic damage, and raises the risk of a Minsky Moment within China’s own hyper-leveraged system keeps rising. 

We are in treacherous waters. The People’s Bank can no longer flick its fingers and ignite instant growth. Debt saturation and weak credit demand have furred up the monetary transmission channels. Extreme rate cuts and ""QE with Chinese characteristics"" would threaten to set of a yuan slide and ultimately a repeat of the 2015 currency crisis.

For now global markets remain in Pavlovian mode. There will always be more Chinese stimulus. Uncle Xi will always look after everybody. Close China-watchers – and some very sharp scientists – suspect that this latest flurry of optimism is just a lull before the thunderstorm."

To avoid domestic spread of the virus, Japanese officials screened every passenger for disease symptoms and tested them for the virus after they landed. Eight tested positive, but four of those had no symptoms at all, says epidemiologist Hiroshi Nishiura of Hokkaido University, Sapporo—which is a bright red flag for epidemiologists who are trying to figure out what the fast-moving epidemic has in store for humanity. If many infections go unnoticed, as the Japanese finding suggests, that vastly complicates efforts to contain the outbreak.”"

Coronavirus is dominating the headlines due to the primal, inherent fear of contagion that unites humanity. In this case, our fears are warranted.

Recent coverage has been walking a fine line between simultaneously reporting the facts and seeking to calm the waters. The risk of coronavirus to the U.S. is low. You have a much greater chance of dying from the flu. And so on.

This is true at the moment. But we are clearly in the early stages of a global pandemic, and coronavirus is much nastier than the flu. Exactly how much nastier remains to be seen, but we are at the mercy of forces largely beyond our control now.

The current best estimates place the [mortality](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/) of coronavirus [between 1% and 3%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html#virulence) with modern medical care. This only sounds low; in fact, it is a very high number. Seasonal influenza kills about 0.1% of patients with the virus, which translates to roughly 650,000 deaths around the world every year.

Coronavirus is more infectious than the flu, and possibly a lot more infectious. If the current numbers are to be believed, it is at least 10 times as lethal as the flu today, which puts it close to the virulence of the influenza strain that killed 50 million people in 1918. Despite medical advances, the world is far more crowded, and hence more vulnerable, than it was in 1918.

Coverage of the conditions in Wuhan has, at times, taken a faintly patronizing tone. Hospital footage of people lying in hallways and masked crowds waiting for days has been shown with the subtle though distinct implication that such scenes would not happen here.

This implication is wrong. This is exactly what would happen here, because the U.S. is not remotely prepared for a coronavirus pandemic. The reason for this is simple: there is hardly any excess capacity built into the U.S. health-care system.

American medicine is designed for profit, not for public health. Hospitals are kept as full as possible all of the time. Empty beds are expensive, and hospitals lose money on them. So there aren’t many empty beds.

In normal circumstances, this rationed market-driven approach works almost well enough. But any significant surge in seriously ill patients will quickly grind our already overloaded system to a halt, and cause secondary effects far beyond the impact of this particular virus.

On any given day, the emergency room where I work can have 40 or 50 patients waiting for many hours in the lobby to be seen, and often a greater number than that.

The emergency room itself is often filled with admitted patients waiting for beds to open in the hospital above us. In many cases, they wait in the ER for days.

When overcrowding like this occurs, which is common everywhere in the U.S., we have no place to see new patients, and try to examine them in the hall or even the lobby itself. Both efficiency and patient safety plummet as a result.

ICU beds are already at a premium, and are already precious things That’s business as usual."

Miserable, scared Chinese people stuck in their homes is not a reason to get worried, but a reason to be less so. 

The number of “recoveries” is now higher than the number of deaths. This virus is almost certainly much less deadly than SARS. 

Plus, it’s February. The places that this virus have impacted are about to get warm. SARS faded almost immediately in summer when the temperature rose. 

Also, and this is SUPER important that the media seems to be missing: the number of cases is not growing exponentially. 

There were [predictions](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/coronavirus%3A-how-fast-to-100000-infected-2020-01-30) made just a week or two ago that for this to truly become a pandemic, you’d need more and more people to get infected. In the last few days, only about 3000 more people a day have been getting infected - more or less consistently. We’re at not even at 40,000 globally, not the 400,000 if it were to be growing exponentially from a week ago. 

And finally, share prices, of all things, should be able to whether a short, almost certainly temporary, fall in revenues for one quarter, because they are not priced based on one quarter’s results. I’d argue the firms most exposed represent a good buying opportunity."

-China is struggling to keep Wuhan alive while claiming all is under control by feeding us fake numbers of infected and dead. Their numbers are, as of right now: 639 dead, roughly 5500 in serious and critical condition (which could mean 2500 on life support). The city is on the edge of turmoil. Forced quarantine by desperate measures. 

-61 on one cruise ship positive for NCov, rest of ship quarantined 14 days.

-Another ship as well is under quarantine.

-on 2/6 there are 268 Known Positive Coronavirus cases across 26 countries. The timeframe for these cases becoming “critical” is just starting. Expect more “critical” patients in the next few days. International as well as China’s case are still moving at a high exponential trajectory.

-Stock up, wash hands, liquidate enough to have cash on hand for a whole month, and learn how to not contaminate yourself. (Keep your hands off your face and surfaces, wash hands frequently, eat only at home, etc.)

People come here, give birth so their child is a Canadian citizen, then use that as a way to skip the usual immigration route to Canada. Obviously Canada needs to update this policy, since it was a hold-over from times before ubiquitous cheap air travel.
There's not really data on *where* birth tourists are coming from, but the fact that [one in five births in Richmond are to foreign nationals](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/vancouver-news/canada-birth-tourism-numbers-1939455) suggests that a large proportion of the [over 4000 birth tourists last year](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/birth-tourism-rising-fast-in-canada-up-13-per-cent-in-one-year-1.4594970) were Chinese nationals. It's common knowledge that China has a problem with cheating, and this is likely just another manifestation of that. This is likely a result of poor governance and instability since the communist era, because traditional Chinese culture values honesty and integrity. Still, its a cultural problem that needs to be addressed.

Wild meat markets seem to be a cultural problem in China. It's not really an thing in most other countries, but *is* a huge risk factor for new diseases. Its a practice that should really should have ended after the SARS outbreak, but apparently didn't.

I don't see how calling the strain by its name/where it came from is racism? Most new organizations (even left leaning ones likes CNN) are calling it the Wuhan Coronavirus. nCoV is short for novel-coronavirus, and Wuhan is the city it originated from. Not really sure where the racism is there. Both names are acceptable.

I don't see it as bad thing to put pressure on the Chinese people to get rid of the unhealthy parts of their current culture; it seemed to work with [shark fin soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_fin_soup#Demand_declines,_2005%E2%80%93present). Obviously racism is a bad thing, but we are allowed to criticize cultural practices like wild meat markets and birth tourism.

Samples are collected by hospitals from patients with respiratory infections. The samples are going to be upper respiratory (nasopharyngeal swabs) or lower respiratory (sputum). At this point it is the lab's responsibility to determine what is causing the infection, or send it to a reference laboratory if they are unable. For identifying causative organism, the lab will try to culture the specimen and look for bacteria to grow using different mediums (pneumonia is typically caused by bacteria). If the cultures are negative, you are most likely dealing with a virus. Viruses are insanely hard to culture from patient samples, so a lab will typically use molecular biology methods (PCR) to identify the organism. These work by extracting DNA/RNA and exponentially increasing the amount using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). PCR uses short DNA molecules that are specific to your organism of interest, so you are limited in your scope of detection by assumptions based on the healthcare providers. Cornavirus would most likely be in a preliminary respiratory panel in China (it is in the US). Coronavirus has multiple molecular assays for detecting different subtypes (SARS, MERS, etc.) The assays typically amplify multiple sections of RNA, with some being specific to SARS, but other specific to Coronavirus. I'd imagine fairly early, China was able to determine that this was a Coronavirus, but not a subtype seen before. After this, it did not take long for 2019-nCoV to be fully sequenced and new molecular tests designed to be specific to its own RNA sequence. The test the CDC is implementing nationwide is able to tell if it is a Coronavirus and 2019-nCoV, so there is not any false positives."

Wuhan is told to round up infected residents for mass quarantine camps.

A senior Chinese official has ordered the authorities in the city of Wuhan to immediately round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.

Sun Chunlan, a vice premier tasked with leading the central government’s response to the outbreak, said city investigators should go to each home to check the temperatures of every resident and interview infected patients’ close contacts.

“Set up a 24-hour duty system. During these wartime conditions, there must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever,” Ms. Sun said.

The city’s authorities have raced to meet these instructions by setting up makeshift mass quarantine shelters this week. But concerns are growing about whether the centers, which will house thousands of people in large spaces, will be able to provide even basic care to patients and protect against the risk of further infection.

A lockdown across the city and much of its surrounding province has exacerbated a shortage of medical supplies, testing kits and hospital beds. Many residents, unwell and desperate for care, have been forced to go from hospital to hospital on foot, only to be turned away without being tested for the virus, let alone treated. They have had to resort to quarantines at home, risking the spread of the virus within families and neighborhoods.

The city has set up makeshift shelters in a sports stadium, an exhibition center and a building complex. Some went into operation on Thursday. The shelters are meant for coronavirus patients with milder symptoms, the government has said.

When Ms. Sun inspected a shelter set up in Hongshan Stadium on Tuesday, she emphasized that anyone who should be admitted must be rounded up, according to a Chinese news outlet, Modern Express. “It must be cut off from the source!” she said of the virus. “You must keep a close eye! Don’t miss it!”

Photographs taken inside the  stadium showed narrow rows of simple beds separated only by desks and chairs typically used in classrooms. Some comments on Chinese social media compared the scenes to those from the Spanish flu in 1918.

According to a widely shared post on Weibo, a popular social media site, “conditions were very poor” at an exhibition center that had been converted into a quarantine facility. There were power failures and electric blankets could not be turned on, the user wrote, citing a relative who had been taken there, saying that people had to “shiver in their sleep.”

There was also a staff shortage, the post said, where “doctors and nurses were not seen to be taking note of symptoms and distributing medicine,” and oxygen devices were “seriously lacking.”"

Few take home points: mortality is much higher in Hubei that in any other province of China and out of China (60x higher). Mortality rates are slowing down both in Hubei and in non-Hubei. If this trend continues we should see a decrease of number of daily deaths in few days.

My personal comment: the high number of casualties in Hubei province has probably been caused by the collapse of the health system, which was completely caught unprepared. So far, the rest of China and the rest of the World seems doing much better, even if the number of contagions is still growing exponentially. Things can change very fast, though. I think that Zhejiang province and Wenzhou in particular will soon show us whether the coronovirus is manageable by the health system."

Working in a hospital, I can tell you that as much as we prepare for the flu season every year, it is always rough. Bed shortages just about everywhere you go, workloads and time between patients increases because of contact precautions (glove, gown, facemask before going in, doff everything before leaving), etc. Also, you get elderly people that get sick, feel unwell and fall, leading to broken bones, head injuries. Then you're not bringing a bunch of vulnerable people all into the same close proximity, putting them at risk for other serious conditions that are commonly acquired in hospital like c-diff, pneumonia, MRSA, etc. It's really hell for any healthcare system.

Now add in an entirely new disease that is just as infectious and potentially more deadly, and with little to no information to work off of (at least initially). Patients and the general population panics, floods the hospitals perhaps unnecessarily. Staff probably panic too, and are over worked and exhausted. Supplies can't come in as easily because of quarentines, nor can you offload some of the patients on nearby facilities to lighten the workload.

Regardless of how serious the illness itself is, I would imagine that this all leads to worse care and worse outcomes. Not blaming the staff in the ground though, I think any system that this hits on a large scale will see similar events unfold. Most hospitals can absorb 5-20 patients with a respiratory illness without major difficulty. These epicenters face an entirely different situation though"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Another 41 people on a cruise liner off Japan tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total confirmed from the ship to 61, Japan’s health minister said on Friday.

***The new cases were out of the 171 remaining test results, he said.***

The drastic jump in infected passengers on the cruise vessel comes as the cruise ship was under the two-week quarantine with about 3,700 people inside.

Yes, it's a similar situation with Falun Gong in China. Falun Gong isn't a particularly great group either, and the newspaper they're associated with, The Epoch Times, has gotten in trouble recently for spreading conspiracy theories about the Wuhan coronavirus. Still doesn't mean that persecuting them (and possibly harvesting their organs in prison) is the right thing to do.

The Gülen movement aren't exactly good guys, but a civilized government wouldn't persecute its supporters. Everyone knows Erdoğan isn't going after Gülen because of his religious activities, he's going after Gülen because he's afraid of a potential rival power base that he doesn't control.

Yeah, if Kanter weren't being persecuted, he'd be the equivalent of a Hare Krishna or even a Scientologist. But he *is* being persecuted."

From the news, they make it sound like his case was uncomplicated. Of note from the case report: 

1. Patient, healthy 35 year old male, presented with nausea, vomiting, dry cough
2. His blood tests for the coronavirus was repeatedly negative & they didn't get a positive until they tested using nose & throat swabs. Stool & mucous also later tested positive.
3. Diarrhea was a later symptom & he developed fever & pneumonia in both lungs 
4. He required supplemental oxygen & IV fluids 
5. His clinical condition worsened to the point where they used ""compassionate care"" measures & administered off label /experimental anti-virals
6. Condition steadily improved until discharge



My understanding of the term ""compassionate care"" is that compassionate Care is considered only in medical cases where doctors do not have any viable treatment and they believe the patient has a significant chance of dying anyway if they do nothing - and sometimes and that scenario they will use experimental treatments if they believe there is a reasonable chance that could work to save the person's life.


I don't believe the media ever reported how serious his condition got. I've looked back at articles and I can't find anything. in fact from the article that was published when he was released from the hospital, it makes it sound like he had a mild uncomplicated case. 

while doctors and hospitals are equipped to handle these kinds of cases if they are few in number, it's pretty easy to imagine how they could overwhelm the medical system and how the outcome might not be as positive and this man scenario without intensive care medical treatment.


So when you say that the majority of the infected seem to suffer mild symptoms and recover, I agree that's what we are being told. But after reading this case, I question if that's the reality."

This isn't a humblebrag or a flex by any measure of intent, I mean it as an example of how the inane drivel published by The Province then, as it is now, is hardly necessary for an eleven year old to comprehend the news of the day.  

Neither ableism nor classism are in play here either; my mother is dyslexic and she and my father carried relatively unskilled jobs. In those days we could be fairly counted among the lowest common denominator in most demographics. A modicum of effort and an endeavor to influence others positively is all that's required to be well informed. 

The sensationalism and presentation of The Province newspaper and its ilk has always been nefarious and inexcusable, particularly because of its supposed mandate of accessibility and appeal to the masses, many of whom have had the misfortune of limited exposure to, and thus a lowered awareness of, accurate and more objectively reported information.  

The cover of The Province yesterday is reprehensible and a fine example of the abysmal state of news reporting for the ""general population"", to use your verbiage.  

Referring to the coronavirus as the ""China Virus"" in bright red typeset on the front page of a major regional newspaper can, and probably does, fuel the unsettling level of extant thinly veiled racism and xenophobia that has been exacerbated by the outbreak. The societal damage this sort of thing is doing is far more troubling than the likely danger that the coronavirus presents. 

I know that The Province newspaper is not unique by its choice to refer to the coronavirus as the China Virus but in doing so it only supports the precedent by doing so and that is wholly ignorant of the experience of those of Asian descent and citizenship whom are a target for prejudice and ostracism by a panic stricken and poorly informed general population."

From what I've read about infections it's all about the first days. If the threat is confirmed to be very infectious (like this nCoV is) then containing it is basically all about making sure it doesn't spread outside the epicenter or that if it does contacts are easily trackable. For nCoV we got the exact opposite: the first days were nothing but denial and information suppression from China, the virus spread outside the epicenter very fast with no hope of tracking contacts and, cherry on the deadly cake its inherently very infectuous with a high R-0, asymptomatic transmission and the usual coronavirus stuff like the ability to live on surfaces for days.

I'll add that imo, and that's pure speculation, the reason the WHO seems to give 0 fucks about actually making sure we contain this thing is because they know it's too late, so might as well keep China happy by not advising travel bans left and right."

I can start off by putting it into perspective by telling you I often get asked — we have an influenza outbreak here.  We have about 8,000 deaths already.  We have about 100,000 hospitalizations.  Why are we paying such attention?  And why are we doing the kinds of things we’re doing here right now?

Well, the reason is, **despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there’s a certainty**, for example, of seasonal flu.  I can tell you all, guaranteed, that as we get into March and April, the flu cases are going to go down.  You could predict pretty accurately what the range of the mortality is and the hospitalizations, as we’ve done over the years.

**The issue now with this is that there’s a lot of unknowns.** As you can see just from the media, the number of cases have steeply inclined each and every day.

Although you couldn't guarantee this will be the case with 2019-nCoV, the likelihood is high due to the number of shared proteins both of these coronaviruses have.)

**Are there any papers or clinical investigations which have specifically studied reinfection of 2019-nCoV?**

No.

**What information might be relevant to reinfection mechanisms of 2019-nCoV?**

Varying coronaviruses have differing incidences and severity of reinfection. In saying anything about 2019-nCov, its important to discuss closely related viruses, which have large numbers of the same proteins (because the proteins determine the activity of the virus.)

**Which is the coronavirus most closely related to 2019-nCoV?**

The various host-specific SARS coronaviruses are closest ([Lancet,2020](https://shorturl.at/fPQ17).)  Two bat-host variants are slightly closer, but the human SARS-CoV is only marginally less so.  MERS is next closest (but far more divergent than any of the SARS variants.)

**What papers are there regarding reinfection of (human) SARS-CoV?**

Due to the limiting ethical issues of inducing reinfection in humans, there is [an animal study which examines the infection and reinfection of SARS-CoV in ferrets.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3454321)  Ferrets are suitable since they have mammalian physiology, and are susceptible to, and have an equivalent clinical pathologic reaction to SARS-CoV.

**What is the study design of the SARS-CoV reinfection experiment?**

>Here ferrets were assigned to three treatment groups for this study: (A) a mock infection control group, (B) a single infection group, and (C) a group that was infected at the same time as group B, then subsequently reinfected 29 days later. The infected groups were innoculated intranasally (IN) with 103 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50 unit per ml) of SARS-CoV TOR2 strain, while the mock infected animals received intranasal instillation of vehicle (serum-free cell culture medium (SFM)).

>Ferrets were monitored for clinical signs of disease twice daily. The most significant symptom observed in SARS-CoV infected animals was sneezing, which was observed in one third of the infected ferrets between 4 and 11 days post-infection (DPI). Sneezing was not observed in ferrets from the control group (A), nor in group (C) at any time post- reinfection.

It should be noted that, like in humans, that healthy non-immunocompromised individuals have a typically less pronounced reaction to respiratory pathogens, however, clinically significant inflammatory tissue responses (I.E. histopathology) are present in respiratory surfaces, regardless of the severity, during an infection, with measurable viral load.

**Is there an effective immune system response to reinfection of SARS-CoV?**

There is a significant normative immune system response, however the response can be incomplete.  That is to say that SARS-CoV-specific antibodies are appropriately generated as an immune response to infection by SARs-CoV, and reinfection provokes a spike in production of those SARS-CoV antibodies.

([See chart indicating Mean levels of serum neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/corecgi/tileshop/tileshop.fcgi?p=PMC3&id=689129&s=32&r=1&c=1))

Immune response, like any other biologic process, relies on proteins to act. While a typical immunity to a pathogen would involve the same primary mechanism, of a spike in antibodies, there are a number of other proteins which act to respond to an infection after the neutralizing antibody has bound to the pathogen. The activity of a number of these proteins can be variable (which in protein expression is termed as upregulation and downregulation) in the immune response of different individuals, in their immune response to SARS-CoV, most notably a downregulation of the type I interferon Response Gene ([see a discussion of IFN, here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4084561))

Downregulation of a gene does not mean absence of that protein, but instead, fewer proteins, and there are a number of pathways by which the body responds to pathogens. A downregulation in expression of IRG does, however mean a less intense or complete immune response.  Certain symptoms may be absent, and those that do exist can be lessened in such a case.

**What clinical differences are there between infection and post-infection pathology in SARS-CoV?**

* [Viral load is decreased below primary infection levels in immune-mediated reinfections]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/corecgi/tileshop/tileshop.fcgi?p=PMC3&id=689135&s=32&r=1&c=1)

* [There is visible and clinically significant reduction of histopathology (I.E.

2020-02-06,His_Holiness,AFL,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/f02xhg/afl_coronavirus_monday_night_football_could/fgr5wk0/,"The AFL could be forced to resuscitate Monday night football as a one-off replacement for the China game, which now hangs in the balance.

Serious doubt was cast on the match on Thursday when Shanghai’s sporting bureau released a statement recommending all sporting events in the city be suspended or postponed until the coronavirus “threat is over”.

“All sporting bodies should suspend sport events until the threat is over and formulate a plan for epidemic prevention to avoid internal infections,” Shanghai Sports General Association declared.

“Organisations should also implement a daily hygiene management system and strengthen health education to urge employees to protect themselves.”

The AFL would not be drawn on the development, saying it would continue to monitor the China outbreak.

The league was adamant it would not put player and staff health and safety at risk.

An epidemiologist and infectious diseases physician this week told the Herald Sun the outbreak was likely to continue in China “for months”

“It’s not going to be over in the short term,” said Dr Katherine Gibney, of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity.

“What happens here is a bit more uncertain, I think. How long we can keep it at bay is a bit more uncertain.”

The travel restrictions would be reversed only if the virus “burnt out in China” or spread across Australia.

“I think it would be a while before we’re thinking (of lifting travel restrictions) in those terms,” Gibney said.

She could not comment on the AFL match in Shanghai, other than to repeat existing Australian Government and WHO travel advice.

The number of confirmed cases globally surged past 28,000 on Thursday, with the death toll climbing to 563, including one in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong.

A decision on the China game is likely to be made before the AFL season-opener on March 19, largely because of constraints around broadcast logistics and turf preparation at Jiangwan Stadium.

With St Kilda and Port Adelaide both having a bye in Round 12, the AFL in consultation with the Saints, as the home team, could reschedule the match on Monday, June 1.

A Monday night game would give the clubs 12 and 13 day breaks respectively before their Round 13 assignments.

The league and cash-strapped Port Adelaide face the prospect of heavy commercial and financial losses should the China game not go ahead.

The Power, which celebrates its 150th football season this year, has gone as far as to put a staff member on the ground in Shanghai to promote the concept.

St Kilda is prepared to wait until the AFL decides on the fixture before it looks at alternate venues.

But any travel to and from mainland China ultimately now rests with the Australian government and World Health Organisation.

The AFL Players’ Association has reiterated a pledge made to the Herald Sun last week to effectively block anything that puts the health and safety of players at risk.

The coronavirus outbreak has led to the cancellation of a number of sporting events in China, including the World Athletics Indoor Championships in Nanjing, scheduled for March 13-15.

Basketball, badminton and boxing qualifying tournaments for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics have also been postponed, rescheduled or moved.

The Chinese Formula 1 Grand Prix, scheduled for April 19, is now also in doubt.

AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said on Wednesday the league was yet to make a contingency for the game, with no alternative venue identified, despite concerns coronavirus containment and any possible vaccines or treatments were still “months” away.

McLachlan indicated on Melbourne radio there would be a “workaround”, if required.

St Kilda and Port Adelaide both have a bye in Round 12 – the week after the scheduled China game.

The match could not be played at the MCG or Marvel Stadium in Round 11 because of venue availability and St Kilda not willing to lose a home game by playing at the vacant Adelaide Oval.

“The AFL’s No.1 priority is the health and safety of all our people,” a spokesman said.

“We will continue to take advice from the Australian government and World Health Organisation regarding any health and safety precautions related to travel to China.

“Our planning for the Shanghai match on May 31 continues, with the situation being closely monitored.”"

Coronaviruses have an enzyme, called a protease, that they need for replication. Theoretically, preventing that enzyme from working would slow the replication of the virus inside its host. One way to prevent an enzyme from working is to find a molecule that can fit inside the active site of the enzyme and remain inside, preventing the enzyme from actually acting on its usual target. Imagine that you fit a key into a lock. This key  doesn’t turn the lock and gets stuck inside. Now the correct key for the lock can’t fit inside either. The same scenario applies to enzymes. 

The authors took the molecular structures of two known HIV protease blockers and analyzed how they fit inside the molecular structures of the coronavirus protease enzyme. Now think of this as figuring out how the key fits in the lock. They then went and used that data to find other molecules that would bind to the protease even tighter which could potentially be used as new drugs to prevent coronavirus replication. That said, there’s a huge difference between merely knowing that a certain molecule can bind to an enzyme and inhibit it and actually using that molecule as a therapy."

IIRC, both had visited Wuhan.   Doctors in Wuhan have repeatedly stated that the confirmed case count is an underestimate because they are limited in test kits and can only test and treat the most severe cases.  If, as is expected, the number of new cases far outstrip their ability to test and confirm, then we are likely only looking at the tip of the iceberg - the most severe cases.  It makes sense that this group would have a higher death rate.  In contrast, other provinces, especially those with high quality health care, are not under the same strain and are more likely to be in a position to test and confirm milder cases.  This is particularly so for international cases, where there is a strong push to detect cases early before the virus spreads.  Moreover, an interview from a Wuhan ICU doctor noted that most patients die in the 3rd week after infection (see  [https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-06/reporters-notebook-we-interview-front-line-coronavirus-doctor-101512020.html](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-06/reporters-notebook-we-interview-front-line-coronavirus-doctor-101512020.html)).  The cases outside Hubei are, on average, newer, so it may just take time to see the death rate increase.  The same goes for international cases.  We've already seen several patients' conditions rapidly deteriorate.  Thus far, there are few enough patients that extraordinary measures can be used.  In Wuhan, we know that lots of patients with severe symptoms can't even get admitted to the hospital.  It makes sense that more of these patients would die.  

I'm not saying I believe the official figures.  I just think there are other potential explanations.  I think the death rates in Wuhan are clearly undercounted since doctors in Wuhan have already stated that if a person dies without a confirmed diagnosis, they are counted as dying from ""viral pneumonia"", not coronavirus."

I asked it here a week ago but didn’t get an answer

I just paste some of my notes:

There are four strains of corona viruses in humans causing cold like symptoms:

Two of them, OC43 and 229E, were discovered in the 1960s but had circulated in cows and bats, respectively, for centuries. The others, HKU1 and NL63, were discovered after the 2003-2004 SARS outbreak, also after circulating in animals. It’s not known how long they’d existed in people before scientists noticed

OC43 and 229E are more prevalent than other endemic human coronaviruses, especially in children and the elderly. Together, the four are responsible for an estimated one-quarter of all colds.
35% of infections with 229E and 18% with OC43 were asymptomatic.
Infection rates ran from 0.5% among healthy elderly adults to 15% among healthy young adults (where “healthy” means they had no viral symptoms), with the highest rates coming in the winter of 2000-2001, for no obvious reason — suggesting that coronavirus infection rates will rise and fall unpredictably, much like seasonal flu

The genome of the novel coronavirus consists of a single stand of RNA. Microbes with that kind of genome mutate “notoriously quickly,” But SARS has a molecular proofreading system that reduces its mutation rate, and the new coronavirus’s similarity to SARS at the genomic level suggests it does, too. “That makes the mutation rate much, much lower than for flu or HIV,”

Exposure to the four endemic coronaviruses produces immunity that lasts longer than that to influenza, Webby said, but not permanent immunity. 
Like respiratory syncytial virus, which can re-infect adults who had it in childhood, coronavirus immunity wanes.

Right now instead of looking and finding items to cop, spend the time learning, it’ll pay off. Basically just commit to 1-2 hours a day of learning instead of shopping. You’ll see how fast you get it all. The tutorials are everywhere and they all have different tips n info.

• Never be afraid to ask a seller/shop about an item!

• always vet the seller/shop

• be patient as time zone differences and they are busy (especially right now with end of CNY & Coronavirus)

• be understanding about shipping times & delays

(I like to educate but also like to complain as it’s a fine line when other users don’t wanna put in effort or do everything they can in their power to answer the questions)

So you can be re-infected, and in rare cases the re-infection can be worse.  There are also some issues with producing vaccines for coronaviruses.  In animal testing, some coronavirus vaccines seemed to produce an enhanced immune response when challenged with infection, which resulted in increased morbidity and mortality:

> Vaccines targeting several animal CoVs have been developed, and some have been demonstrated to be efficacious in preventing viral infection. However, a phenomenon of enhanced disease following vaccination has been observed in cats upon infection with feline infectious peritonitis virus following previous infection, vaccination, or passive transfer of antibody. The phenomenon is not fully understood but is believed to be a result of enhanced uptake and spread of the virus through binding of virus-antibody immune complexes to Fc receptors on the surfaces of macrophages; low-titer (subneutralizing) antibodies directed against the S protein are mainly responsible. Although antibody enhancement appears to be limited to feline infectious peritonitis virus among CoVs, similar concerns have been raised with regard to SARS-CoV."

#Regarding Stellar network...

There's some stuff happening around and the SDF team is working hard. No announcements of announcements as always, that's moto we know and I hope it keeps that way. Good marketing needs a good design with good vibes, as you noticed today SDF put live the new website they were working for a couple of months. In my opinion, it looks much better and it will help. If any of you find an issue comment on kyle's post [here](https://redd.it/ezu5nk).

#Regarding Photon...

It's pretty much ready to be launched but the Reddit folks need to fix something, because Reddit community is very very big and the Reddit team needs to share their time trough multiple communities and side projects, Photon is paused for a couple of weeks so they can have some time to tackle some details for Photon on their servers. However, we have been testing it in a private subreddit, it's working fine and looks awesome. Keybase [fixed the ""Replace"" feature](https://github.com/keybase/client/commit/97cecc12e693d38978ca366ee56d823508f24e22) in their sep7 implementation and the app is ready to be used with Photon too. Because there's a lot of people from different teams working and helping with it, the side effect is a delay due to different schedules, time zones, personal life, working hours, and professional tasks — a lot of syncing needs to happen.

#Regarding Lumenaut...

As some of you may know, Lumenaut is being rebranded and initially, it was going to be called HUBL (a wordplay between Hub and HODL, with a mixture of Hubble) but most probably I can't use that word anymore because it's [trademarked](https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/012711347) by a company in Germany for metal materials. So, right now I'm in the process of trying to figure out if I can still use it or if I need to find another good name for the company. Any suggestions??

This last Tuesday I receive the good news that my application was accepted by the Estonian government and between 2 to 3 weeks I should start using Estonia's financial and legal structure for the company. I was shooting for an e-Money license but I need some resources such as at least €350,000, a well-structured business plan of at least 2-3 pages, a lot of details of my IT system (money flow, asset and data protection, etc.), prove I have a plan to be self-sustained, and then I may have to wait half year for the result which could be negative.

I don't have the capital for the e-Money license so I'm shooting lower and will try to get a license to provide services of exchanging a virtual currency against a fiat currency to make the best and only multi-collateral fiat token on Stellar network. Then work my way up with time. The time frame is to register the company and trademark in 2 to 3 weeks, then wait 3 days and apply for the license, then wait at least 1 month for the license to be approved and make the fiat token live. Meanwhile, I will be searching for banks to partner with, I need a bank wich gives me an API to use and so far the best contenders I have in mind are Citibank and Santander.

Along with the fiat token, I'm also finishing the community website which should go live soon, it will be a hub open for anyone to register and contribute. We will be paying for content creation and I will have some gifts to offer those that believed and supported Lumenaut all this time. There are some partnerships in the way too but a little bit too soon to talk about it. I hope the community will help out and use the community platform!

#Regarding the market...

I have been paying special attention to the coronavirus situation. As you may or may not know, [February is historically notorious](https://old.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/akxl9w/rstellar_daily_chat_tuesday_january_29_2019/ef8skpa/) for a capitulation associated with Asian citizens for the Lunar New Year festivals, and by the fact that IRS starts accepting paper and electronic tax returns. True or not true? We will finally discover that or at least have more data with this year's situation, to mirror or not those beliefs.

With the coronavirus quarantine all over China, I suspect there will not exist a lot of public festivalization in some Chinese regions, this may result in less capitulation associated with the Q1 this year. One week ago I would give you a different answer because Shanghai Stock Exchanges, which are the second biggest in the world, went down 8%, however recently due to some stimulus and some recent news such as a vaccine for coronavirus, it has recovered that 8%. I'm still not sure about the veracity of this vaccine or it will still take some months to be available. In reality, Shanghai's Stock Market is 5% higher compared to February of 2019, hence it's difficult to see in this indicator the coronavirus effect.

Anyway, there are some numbers that explain what is one week of Chinese holidays impact in domestic tourism. The last time there was a golden week of Chinese holidays it was in the [first day of October](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China), which is the Nacional Day of China, it was 20 billion of income in dollars from domestic tourism. At this right moment, the equivalent to those domestic holidays would be higher, so that number disappeared because of coronavirus. The [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) in Chinese economy is equivalent to 18% of the entire world in nominal dollars, not in purchasing power parities, if we look at [purchasing power parities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) then without a doubt China is the biggest economy in the world, in nominal terms, it's the second-biggest economy in the world.

Taking all into account, I believe we should avoid that a medicine virus turn into a social virus but it's difficult to avoid that with current number of mortal victims and infected, it's natural that the business environment has deteriorated due to the lack of international contact but I see that World Health Organization is doing a good job preventing an excess of protectionism and isolationism to prevent what happened after the stock market crash of 1929, which generated a big depression as a result from the customs and protectionist measures.

There's already a conjunctural damage due to the coronavirus, the structural damage comes with time if the current situation isn't addressed in the next couple of months. In terms of general economy, we can see a little smash, at a company level, the company that works with China doesn't depend on the GDP to survive if it lowers a couple of percentages, it depends on the work it has to do with China and it will die if it doesn't have that work to do in 2 or 3 months, for sure they will not survive for 6 months if they can't resume their communications and work with China. The line of industrial auto parts stopped, the industrial heavy machinery parts stopped, the Air Travel industry stopped... Overall, conjunctural pain is already here we need to prevent it from extending to a structural issue.

The extreme dependency of certain markets from China is wrong, a lot of productive capacity is there not because they do it better but because labour is cheap. An economy based in a point where it's produced and a point where it's consumed will result in a dead economy if one of those two points stop. We need to be globalized where it's produced and where it's consumed to find a way to have a resilience completely different from the current panorama - this is the structural change that needs to happen. At a national level, we need to approach governments to promote alternative commerces and alternative destinations grab our infrastructures and prevent our detriment of the ability to resist. For example, we have the Japan market where most are well received but generally speaking, we don't go there and it's the third biggest economy in the world. Why do we get to China and not to Japan? The Chinese market is an important market that affects most small to medium countries so a crisis there affects the world economy. 

So, will this conjunctural damage become structural damage? Will this favour cryptocurrency because people will not capitulate? Will this not favour cryptocurrency because people will capitulate it even more? My opinion? To the moon! I have a feeling this will be a good year for cryptocurrency."

To put it in perspective. China uses something like 7 billion tonnes a year of coal. They are by far the largest coal producer in the world.

Australia exports a total of 350-400 million tonnes a year.

That's why it's fairly naive when people claim we need to stop exporting Coal because it will help reduce carbon emissions. Not to say that there is not an argument for stopping it from a moral standpoint, but to suggest it will lower net emissions is a bit naive.  

On the flip side, if China shuts just 30% of it's production capacity of Coal temporarily due to Coronavirus, suddenly our 350-400t of exports is sucked up rapidly, leading to short term rise in prices and economic good times for that sector in Australia."

“ Everyone on Bruce’s “close contact” list received two phone calls from a public health worker to impress upon them the seriousness of the situation. They were required to take their temperatures twice a day and report any fevers or coughs. After that, they could opt to receive a text message, carefully worded so as not to raise alarm should another person see it.

“This is the Health District with your daily symptom check for your household,” it read. “Please reply with 1 if you have no symptoms, reply with 2 if someone in your household is ill.”
Across the county line, Bruce’s counterparts in King County were performing the same task with dozens of others who worked with the patient, were on his flight or rode with him from the airport. At least nine people who were exposed to the patient have developed symptoms that fell within the CDC’s criteria for testing. Results for three of them are still pending; the others were negative.”



“ Still, when Bruce could not reach one of the people she was monitoring over the weekend of Jan. 25, she grew alarmed. After leaving a message with the woman’s emergency contact, she received a call at home that night. The woman explained that she had been in the process of moving to Wisconsin and that she had taken her flight as planned.
“You did what?” Bruce asked. The woman has subsequently tested negative.

Why had local health officials not released the name of the clinic where the patient had received care?

There was no reason to believe, health officials told residents, that the patient had posed a risk to people with whom he had not been in reasonably close contact. To disclose the clinic location could create a false sense of panic, officials said.

I had two close family members in Beijing China and had to cut their visit short, returning to the US right before the travel ban came into effect, so I know personally what it is like to feel fear. (They are self-monitoring in my home, so there's that - it is now day 6 FWIW).

Yet here in the US I am optimistic that the public health system / information sharing will be the most powerful weapon against panic and overwhelming the system. On top of that the CDC issued an Emergency Use Authorization for diagnostic tests (I work in the field) and the FDA approved it the day after (Feb 5). And they make the real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR test (rRT-qPCR) available to even order online here: [https://www.internationalreagentresource.org/](https://www.internationalreagentresource.org/) (from their [Situation Summary page here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html)). 

I was alarmed at the NEJM piece (from Germany) published a week ago (Thursday) claiming asymptomatic transmission to four others from a Wuhan businessperson's visit to work colleagues. That paper was retracted (!) when it came out the researchers did not directly speak with the woman from Wuhan, she did suffer from a fever and took medication to suppress the symptom.

At any rate, when people have fever they can get tested, and this is how society will be able to quarantine the infected individuals and control the spread. I expect every academic medical center and large clinical laboratories (LabCorp and Quest here in the US) to scale this up quickly, given the situation - and time to prepare. The sequence of the primers and probes for the TaqMan assay are published, and the aforementioned kit (with positive and negative controls) are important reagents to ensure accuracy.

In the meantime, the best protection is to wash your hands regularly, and in absence of soap and water to use hand sanitizer. Funny how people reflexively want to go out and buy N95 masks, as it helps the sick not spread the disease, rather than protect from getting infected in the first place (studies are clear that it 'may help' rather than 'will help' in getting infected)."

I wouldn't worry too much about it if ""colds"" are the worst infection you're getting. If you were getting frequent pneumonias or stomach flu or something then I'd be more concerned. It's probably just a bad year for you or you're getting exposed to more people that have young kids or something else. Is your vaping system (tubes, machine itself, etc.) clean? If your vaping system isn't clean and is just colonized with gunk (especially if you're sharing it with someone else), that could be a source. Smoking marijuana probably doesn't help as it can irritate your throat and lungs and make you more prone to respiratory infections, but I can't blame the frequent infections solely on that. Also, don't worry about coronavirus, it's probably not that bad.

The flu is influenza, coronavirus is coronavirus.  The major difference is how it approaches your body.  The influenza uses hemagglutinin, which is a gloygoprotein, to bind the virus to the sialiac acid produced by your body.  At that point the virus is using your cell to produce itself.  Then it uses neuraminidase , an enzyme, to cleave itself from the sialic acid and release more influenze cells into your body.  Hence the name H1N1.  The influenza viruses only attack epithelial cells.  The 2019-nCoV binds to the ACE2 receptors in your lungs.  The ACE2 receptors directly impact pulmonary and liver function as well as having the ability to control vasodilative processes.  The ACE2 receptor controls baroreflex which is a homeostatic process to control blood pressure and vasodilation.  So your body, not only having viral pneumonia, also has decreased liver function and possible malfunctioning endothelial cells surrounding the heart and blood vessels.  So HxNx (x being number variant of said protein, enzyme) does not equal CoV.  There are 6 CoV that can infect humans.  2 or 3 cause the COMMON COLD, not the flu.  The other 3 are SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV.  All 3 utalize the ACE2 receptors."

New Virus Cruise Ship Confirmed 41 New Infections

February 7, 2020 9:35 New pneumonia
According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 41 new infections have been confirmed on cruise ships that have been identified as a mass infection of the new coronavirus.

Of the cruise ship's passengers and crew, 20 people have been confirmed to be infected, with virus tests being conducted on people with fever and other symptoms and those with thick contacts. **This brings 61 people**— to the exception of Hong Kong men who have already disembarked on cruise ships.

Of the more than 3,700 crew members and passengers on cruise ships, a total of 273 people who had symptoms such as fever and cough, or who had been in intense contact with people with symptoms and collected specimens were completed.

The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has decided to transport 41 newly confirmed people to medical institutions in Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, and Shizuoka Prefectures in addition to Kanagawa Prefecture.

Some of the people being transported include the elderly and foreign nationals.

The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare requires that nearly 3,700 remaining passengers and crew remain on board the ship and, in principle, wait in their rooms for 14 days.

It makes sense to avoid large crowds, especially if they are  Asian. I cannot even readily tell Chinese apart from other Asians at a  glance and I’m Asian myself. You do not have the time and energy to  interview every Asian you see and ask if they recently went to China. It  just doesn’t work realistically.

Further,  China is something like 95% Han Chinese and foreign languages are not  really accommodated to. So Asian people are the most likely to have  recently visited China. Logically, Asians are the most likely to be  carrying the virus AT THE MOMENT. The current statistics also show an overwhelming majority of virus cases are Chinese people.

It’s  not like the USA where it’s a giant melting pot, people speak all kinds  of languages, and an outbreak would mean it doesn’t make sense to avoid  only brown people, for example. And you cannot just point to anyone on  the street and say he’s definitely American so is highly likely to be  carrying the disease. Here, though, it makes sense to avoid Asians if  you don’t know where they have been, especially Chinese.

Sure,  avoid them. But don’t be a dick. Do what you need to reduce risk for  yourself and your family. But be civil and reasonable. Shouting slurs,  being violent toward Asians, and posting hate about all Asians for  spreading it does not reduce the risk. Instead, doing that actually  makes moral people want to act at ease around them right now to show  nothing is wrong, increasing the risk. Tempers flare and people start  losing focus of the more threatening issue here. There are kind people  who will see mistreatment and stand up and ignore the heightened risk.  These protectors are not bad people nor do they have bad intentions, but  the priority is the health issue, not a race issue.

Behave  like they could potentially have the virus, not that they definitely do  and are personally responsible for the outbreak. Avoiding crowds of  them when you don’t know where they came from is not senseless. In the long run, reducing infections is better for everyone. Asians included.

Hopefully  not, but if this coronavirus starts spreading in your country, you  should avoid ALL crowds of people, not pay particular attention to  Asians because by then it no longer makes sense to do so."

It's easy to say that we should keep everything in perspective, but that's a tough challenge in these early days of a legitimate, emerging bio-crisis.

""The third and sixth patients from last week traveled around the country without knowing they had been infected. The number of people they came into contact with surpassed 1,000 before they began showing symptoms and later were confirmed to be infected. That's why there were many confirmed patients earlier,"" Kim Woo-joo from the Korea University Guro Hospital said Thursday. ""From the viewpoint of infectious diseases, this is an anticipated event, so anticipate more to come.""

Kim noted the coronavirus outbreak is now spreading to small communities, putting everyone in the country at risk.

Four additional cases were confirmed here, Thursday, pushing the total to 23. Three of these ― the 20th, 21st and 22nd ― were infected by already confirmed patients, while the last, a Chinese tourist, is suspected of being infected in their home country.


The 19th patient who was confirmed Wednesday evening was a colleague of the 17th patient, and both attended a conference in Singapore together.

Korean Medical Association spokesman Park Jong-hyuk criticized the government's current approach to finding confirmed patients. ""The government's main task is finding suspected patients quickly and sending them to special clinics where they can be diagnosed and treated separately from other people. But I feel like the government is failing them.""

Acknowledging the spread to local communities, the Ministry of Health and Welfare called on people to pay extra attention to personal hygiene and coming into contact with others.

""We call for extra attention because the coronavirus seems to be spreading rapidly,"" said Vice Minister Kim Gang-lip during a press conference. ""We are working to tighten quarantine measures, especially at the local government level.""

Kim also said wearing a mask was becoming critical and the government would ensure an adequate supply at affordable prices. People found guilty of monopolizing sales of masks can face a prison term of up to two years.

The government also said it would revise its definition of suspected patients from those who have visited China to anyone with symptoms and a letter from a doctor advising further testing. This will allow anyone to be tested at the coronavirus special public medical clinics.


This comes after the 16th patient, who had traveled to Thailand, visited such a clinic and asked to be tested but was refused because she hadn't visited China.

The 20th patient is a family member of the 15th patient who visited The Place shopping mall in Wuhan in January. The 21st patient was infected after meeting the 6th patient. The 22nd patient is a family member of the 16th patient. The 23rd patient is a Chinese tourist who came to Korea on Jan. 23 with a group of other Chinese visitors. She is the first to be confirmed among Chinese tourists to Korea.

""Not just in Korea, but in Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong, more human transmission cases occurred, making everyone in the country vulnerable to the coronavirus,"" Kim said."

And for those on mobile copy-paste for you:




A parent at Mirror Lake Middle School is angry over a decision that allowed a student who recently returned from China to go back to class.

The parent, who didn’t want to be identified, said he doesn’t understand why the district wouldn’t require a two-week waiting period to ensure the student doesn’t have the new 2019 novel coronavirus and wasn’t passing it on.

On Wednesday, the district sent a letter to Mirror Lake families explaining the situation. In it, they said they are following the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as city and state health officials.

Speaking about the case to reporters, medical officer Dr. Bruce Chandler with the Anchorage Health Department said the CDC recommendations are constantly changing and were different at the time the student and their family returned from China approximately nine days ago.

“If I were to fly in from China now I’m supposed to be in quarantine for 14 days, because things have changed a lot in China in the past week” Chandler said. “At the time this child returned, there was no such recommendation.”

Chandler said the CDC does not recommend retrospectively following previous recommendations.

ASD superintendent Deena Bishop echoed Chandler. She said the student poses no risk to the school or the community.

“We would never have had a student come to school if we didn’t think school was safe for that student or anyone else,” Bishop said.

The student is being monitored regularly by the school nurse and has shown no signs of illness, according to Bishop. She said she wanted to let the Mirror Lake community know what the situation was in order to dispel rumors on social media.

“We had no reason to believe that children were unsafe,"" she said. “And so really, following the recommendations of the experts is what I can tell parents. And that those recommendations will come from the websites of the experts, not just rampant on social media.”

Bishop confirmed the student has siblings who are also enrolled in the Anchorage School District. She said it was important not to stigmatize them or the family — all of whom are ""highly cooperative."""

Just to give an example, our collaborators had tasked a graduate student to identify which proteins were required for a gene activity. Most graduate students here (this was pre-CRISPR mind you) would have take two months and tried the top 3 of the family of 40 or so proteins. Not these guys though, he took 8 months and tested *every single one*. That’s just an example of one of the graduate students in his lab, and each one seemingly worked harder than the last.

Your body wants to be at 37 °C... 
It is the temperature at which your enzymes function most efficiently and your body will go out of its way to remain at that temperature (sweating, shivering, goosebumps, blood vessels constricting/dilating etc..). Moving outside of this internal body temperature is bad, the body only has a tolerance of about +-6 °C before your enzymes begin to denature and you become very ill. Getting your body temperature to 56 °C to combat this virus is a certain death penalty. For context, the highest recorded body temperature ever was 46°C and that bloke spent 24 days in hospital... 

If you were suggesting using a sauna to kill existing coronavirus on your body then fine I guess it is feasible. However, you’ll probably be better off having a shower or washing your hands.

2020-02-06,monorailmedic,Cruise,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/f00x52/how_cruise_ships_are_handling_mass_onboard/fgqy9bk/,"Cruise lines have put in place additional screening, including reviewing recent travels, and checking temperatures.  Based on this and potentially other criteria, some people may be denied boarding.

While the confined nature of a ship is logically a place disease can spread, cruise ships are also uniquely equipped to handle these things, as ensuring a sanitary shipboard environment has been a huge effort for many years.  In fact, all that norovirus you hear about - by 2018 CDC numbers you're actually 35x as likely to get it on land.  

Similarly while coronavirus is a world health concern, for individuals in N America right now, the flu remains a much bigger concern, with tens of thousands dying from the flu each year in the US alone.

To put things in perspective a different way, 30 million people cruised last year, and so far, two ships have been quarantined, with a total passenger count around  of about 7000.  Now that's not nothing - the situation absolutely stinks for those people.  This however hasn't happened, at least in recent history, but if we're only to compare to last years numbers (ignoring the total number of people ever quarantined on a ship and the total number of people who have ever cruised), we see that this is 0.023% of cruisers in the past year.  Not quite as massive as the news stories make it seem.

I'm not suggesting this is not a serious issue - it is.  It's imperative that cruise lines, airlines, governments, healthcare providers, etc take this very seriously.  Right now however, there are far bigger concerns for N America residents/individuals traveling on a ship int eh Caribbean (for example).  In fact, 0.73% of people in the US are killed or injured in traffic accidents each year, and in 2018, you had a 20% chance of getting influenza (which in healthy adults, may have a higher mortality rate than coronavirus).

To more directly answer your question as to when it will be a non-issue - I'd bet the heads of the CDC, WHO, etc can't yet answer that.  Things will get worse before they get better - we just don't know the timing.

I'll be cruising again in two days and as always, I'll share anything interesting I find on my site, social media, etc."

They'll typically last a couple weeks.  The idea is that memory B cells typically develop that help you recreate the antibodies if you're exposed again.  But even those memory B cells don't stick around forever, either. 

Not a doctor, but likely not everyone has a memory b cell response, and the lifetime of the antibodies may vary from patient-to-patient.

Information is pretty limited at this point. There seems to be decent sources indicating relapse of coronavirus is a real concern, but they seem to suggest this is just a problem for some patients.  As long as enough patients retain short/moderate-term immunity, it should die out."

• First off, we can’t trust China to accurately report their numbers. Historically we just can’t 100% accept their numbers as fact. 

• People are saying the CFR is around 2%, which is bad alone. If as many people got Wuhan Coronavirus as get the flu every year the United States would lose 1,000,000+ people. 

• 565 dead, 1,382 recovered. So of people that have left the hospital in some fashion, 29% have died. There’s also been stories of patients being turned away, so we don’t know how many are dead at home. 

• We likely won’t know details until after the outbreak, or if the outbreak hits the US mainland full force.

We actually distinguish between droplet transmission and airborne transmission, what you described is the former: https://eportal.mountsinai.ca/Microbiology/faq/transmission.shtml#four

>I am very curious where you saw that it's not airborne and requires close contact to spread considering literally everything I've seen has said the opposite

What do you mean? All the cases so far, especially the foreign ones do not have evidence of pure airborne transmission, and the absence of a super spreader so far also suggests that airborne transmission, especially asymptomatically, is extremely unlikely. We have individuals only infecting people who they have close contact with instead of for example..large number of people on a single flight, etc. So far the fact that every single foreign case is of people who traveled to Hubei and people who had close contact with people from Hubei is also supporting evidence of such. There hasn't been any second generation cases outside of China yet, and very few even inside China.

Furthermore, we aren't even very sure of the likelihood of asymptomatic transmission, as the initial report was based on faulty information: https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/04/high-profile-report-on-asymptomatic-spread-of-coronavirus-based-on-faulty-information-health-officials-say/"

CORONAVIRUS - EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW SO FAR:

CORONAVIRUS is not a new virus. It has been around for at least two decades and is transmitted from animals to humans and then from humans to humans. It is said to have originated from eating cats, bats, and camels (depending on the strain). 2019-nCoV is a supposedly new strain of the coronavirus that surfaced in mid-December 2019 from a seafood market in China.

Now follow with me:

In 2004, the CDC filed a patent on a newly isolated coronavirus known as SARS. It expired on January 24, 2020 -- pure coincidence given the timing of this media outbreak I'm sure.

In 2015, the Pirbright Institute filed a patent for a live attenuated coronavirus to be used in the production of vaccines. The Pirbright Institute is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and recently received $5.5 million dollars to do what they do. They were ""coincidentally chosen"" to create the vaccine behind this current outbreak.

They will be partnering with Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) to create said vaccine. This company brought you the zika quackxine in a record-breaking 7 months (run ... just ... run).

Inovio Pharmaceuticals will be partnering with Wistar (funded by Bill and Melinda Gates), GeneOne (funded by Bill and Melinda Gates and sponsored by the US FDA) and Twist Biosciences (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). If the Wistar Institute sounds familiar, it should. This is the company that produced the WI-38 cell line derived from the ""too many to count"" aborted fetuses in the vaccines injected into your children.

October 18 2019. Event 201 is a high-level pandemic exercise hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and none other than the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

This is extremely fascinating because this pandemic simulation exercise of coronavirus took place about 6 weeks before the first illness from the coronavirus was actually reported in Wuhan China!

That is one hell of a coincidence if you believe in that sort of thing. Another fascinating connection, is the fact that not only did the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation participate in and help set up the pandemic simulation of a coronavirus outbreak, but they just so happen to fund the group who owns the patent to the deadly coronavirus and who some how was able to create the vaccine for it within just a couple hours 🤔 Again an incredible coincidence…

All this and the perfect timing of Netflix's new PANDEMIC documentary, how convenient, just another coincidence?

AND LASTLY, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Director-General for the World Health Organization (WHO) was a top Executive and Central Committee member of the Tigray People Liberation Front (TPLF), which is a political party in Tigray, Ethiopia, and is a Global blacklisted terrorist organisation. Now this is the guy looking after the worlds health, hmmmm, scary stuff.

You really can't make this stuff up. Too many coincidences for my liking.

News 1+1 show is one of the daily major broadcasting about the situation on nCoV outbreak in China, hosted by Bai Yansong. This is the main source for people in China on the coronavirus outbreak. He usually interviews officials and scholars in the show, from the gov leaders of Wuhan to important scholars. (And the leaders of Wuhan did terribly on the show a few days ago) Here is a summary of today's show(summarizing as I am listening, so it's only a slap-dash job).

* In the opening, Bai Yansong introduces the new numbers, in and out of Hubei, then in and out of Wuhan
   * Outside of Hubei, the growth is steady, but the Hubei Wuhan number is very worrying.
* There are lack of beds and all kinds of supplies in Wuhan which is obvious. (**He shows a chart showing the availability of Wuhan hospital beds as of Feb 4. Most hospitals have zero empty beds.**)
* From now on, the designated hospitals will be only taking confirmed & serious/critical cases, and suspected & critical cases.
* The makeshift coronavirus hospitals will be in use immediately, taking confirmed mild cases.
* **Interview with the head of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Wang Chen**:
   * Q: How's the situation right now? We see that the pressure on Wuhan is enormous.
   * A: The situation is very serious. **A large number of patients are not admitted into hospitals in time, which is a huge problem. Their activities will cause more infections at home and in the community. This is the most important reason of the worsen situation.**
   * Q: You just mentioned group infection at home. But this is conflicting. People are following guidance and staying at home, but then if one of them gets infected, everyone is infected.
   * A: They key is to admit the patient into the hospital in time and put them in quarantine. **There are a lot of mild cases not admitted because the hospitals are taking mostly serious and critical cases. But people with mild symptoms have greater mobility and therefore more likely to spread the virus.**
   * Q: After coming to Wuhan and evaluate the situation, you suggest makeshift hospitals. Why, and how much do you expect it to improve the situation?
   * A: We are solving the problem of not having the ability of take in more patients. We have tried methods like expanding the designated hospitals  but we still have limited spaces. **Even though those makeshift hospitals don't have ideal medical condition, they can immediately provide thousands of beds. They can be used for confirmed mild cases who need medical help and be quarantined.** This is the key method to stop further infections.
   * Some discussion about the names of the makeshift hospitals, and that they are only for **basic medical care for mild cases**, also for them to be **monitored and transferred to proper hospitals when needed**. The goal is to use the least resource and time to increase the capacity for patients. It is not the best but a practical solution.
   * Q: People are worried about cross infection in those hospitals, are the worries justifiable?
   * A: To some extent. But they are infected with the same virus. The mild cases can mostly take care of themselves but 1. they need some none-intensive medical caring and 2. most importantly, be separated from family and community. It's the urgent method in a big outbreak like this.
   * Q: We heard that 90% of cases are mild but as for who will go into these hospitals, the accuracy becomes critical as people not actually infected with nCoV will likely catch it in such hospitals. How can we make fast and accurate judgement here?
   * A: We will only take those tested positive and we will not take the elderly, or those with pre-existing conditions as they are more vulnerable. It's a community for mild cases, with limited medical care. **Again I repeat this is not the ideal solution but only an optimal, practical one at current situation.**
   * Q: Is there mature, fast and accurate testing methods yet?
   * A: Our ability for testing is improving but not enough. Different tests produced by different companies vary in accuracy. **However, one important note about the virus: not every case will come out positive. There are a large number of cases where people who have been in close contact with confirmed cases, and show similar symptoms, but we are unable to test them positive and they have become suspected cases.**  In Wuhan we suggest these cases be ""clinically confirmed"" in order for better management. **Looking back at the confirmed cases, we only get about at most 30%\~50% chance of positive in strep tests, even for confirmed patients.**
   * Q: Are those hospitals dangerous for the medical workers?
   * A: It's the same for them there or in other hospitals. It's more dangerous for the patients, but for example, we will do a flu test and make sure they are not just having a flu. The quarantine level won't be as good as specialized hospital but it's the only practical solution now. We have to focus on the most significant problem which is the availability.
   * Q: In the past we have the problem of mild and serious cases mixing together in the hospital with no enough beds. Will the 11 new makeshift hospitals, possibly adding 10k+ beds, completely solve the current problem in Wuhan, if the outbreak doesn't make a dramatic turn?
   * A: **Frankly we can't make sure of how many patients are there in Wuhan at the moment. We hope that the number won't exceed our current number of 10k-20k designed for these hospital.** However, if the cross infection in the community are not stopped, that number is up in the air, which is exactly the purpose of our special makeshift hospitals. This is special method under extreme conditions. Otherwise there is no way the hospitals take in that many patients. We have to quarantined the infected and control it. This has to be done. We hope that the society will be understanding of this.
   * Q: ""Admit all that should be admitted, treat all that should be treated"" is what the Wuhan leaders mentioned. Are we working towards that goal now?
   * A: The makeshift hospitals are a step towards that goal, and we also need to increase the testing ability to meet the diagnosing need. **I have to remind everyone that the current reported number for new confirmed cases are not an accurate number for actual new cases. They are the number of tested positive. Not all new cases are tested. Therefore there is a difference between the reported number of confirmed cases and actual new cases. Please note the different concepts.**
   * Q: **Which means we have a backlog?**
   * **A: Very likely. And this has to be emphasized. We need to be practical and realistic and be decisive.**
   * Q: So, for the backlog problem we now face the question of suspected cases. We solve the mild/serious cases problem with makeshift hospitals. Are there good solutions for suspected cases?
   * A: For suspected cases, it's clear they should be quarantined in single rooms. Our hope is that they will be tested as soon as possible to determine if they should be taken into the makeshift hospitals, or hospitals if they are very sick. **We also have 'clinically confirmed' cases among suspected cases who are not tested but highly likely to have it based on the symptoms, and they should be taken into hospital immediately too.**
   * Q: Do we have good news for medicines for nCoV?
   * A: Remdesivir in clinical test today; studying other medicines too. The curing of single cases ≠ scientifically proven effective.
   * Q: When will scientific research be of use for this outbreak?
   * A: The more urgent need is the medicines which we mentioned before. Vaccines for coronavirus are difficult to produce and we hope it will be invented in the future.
   * Q: How much do we know about this virus now, after battling with it for this long?
   * A: Very limited. We have good foundations and hope in the near future we will have useful results. (I am leaving out a lot of info here and in the last two Q because they are less time-sensitive. Basically, scientific research takes time.)
   * Q: I have been asking when will we see the 'turning point' of the outbreak everyday, to the point I feel as if I am forcing you scholars to do fortunetelling. Today you say that, **there are no grounds for the prediction of a 'turning point' or 'peak' yet.** Can you elaborate on that?
   * A: '**Turning point' means when we see the number stabilizes and eventually reduce, but the problems are 1. we don't know the 'base' for our judgement, which is the current number of infection; 2. many patients are still out there not quarantined, the infection in the community and at home is still a serious problem.** If no decisive measures are taken, it is unpredictable. Plus there is the problem of possible future variation. Also there is the problem of people travelling and going back to school/work. I am so glad the gov decides to extend the CNY break. We need to track those come out of Wuhan in the 14 day incubation period and then the possible local carriers, before people start working. Lastly, the weather might be contribute to the situation, too."
2020-02-06,fut-,preppers,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/ezs88c/coronavirus_and_mask_mega_thread/fgpwkx2/,"Reposting my continuously updated notes from the previous megathread (now with some added info about a well-documented US case in Washington, etc).

**Putting the coronavirus thing in perspective:**

  * Coronaviruses are a ubiquitous family of viruses that are have been with us for a long time, and are responsible for a significant proportion of all cases of the common cold. That said, like the influenza virus, they have the potential to mutate into something potentially more lethal, as was the case during the [1918 flu pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu).
  
  * Although we are pretty darn good at dealing with bacterial infections, antiviral drugs are still in their infancy, and we do not have a convincing way to treat coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, influenza, and the like. There are some antivirals on the market that are sometimes given to folks with virus-caused respiratory conditions, but the benefits are modest at best, and some research suggests they don't do much at all. There is no vaccine. In that sense, we are not necessarily more ready for a viral pandemic today than we were back in 1918. We know more about prevention, but we also have much higher population densities and a ton of air travel, so there are some legitimate concerns to be had about a potential repeat of the deadly  pandemics of the old.
  
  * The specific 2019-nCoV coronavirus strain was first observed in December 2019 as the authorities were investigating an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases among the workers at a fish market in Wuhan, China. It is entirely possible that the virus is not actually that novel - we weren't really looking for it. But it is also possible that this is where it started, likely due to animal-to-human transmission. Human-to-human transmission is happening, too, with multiple people in China and a handful of travelers returning to the US and to Europe testing positive. As with anything, there's also plenty of conspiracy theories about the alternative origins of the disease - but the simplest explanation is often the best.
  
  * There is ongoing uncertainty around how infectious or dangerous the virus is. Part of the problem is that in many cases, the symptoms are probably pretty mild and indistinguishable from the common cold, so it is difficult to know how many people might have had it - most wouldn't be seeking medical help, and if they did, they wouldn't necessarily get tested for the virus. There are 566 verified deaths and around 28,250 lab-confirmed cases, giving us one potential but likely exaggerated upper bound on mortality (2%). The lower bound is largely unknown: if hundreds of thousands or millions had the virus, then even this number of deaths wouldn't necessarily be worse than the flu or the common cold. The number of confirmed cases is climbing fairly steeply and accelerating, with 2,000+ added per day. The case fatality rate of 2% is holding very steady, down from 4% in the early reports.
  
  * The Internet loves rumors, so there's a lot of speculation about a potential cover-up. In principle, that's a distinct possibility - governments around the globe have a rich history of downplaying risks to avoid panic or protect the tourism industry. That said, any significant death toll would be difficult to hide. China is not North Korea: they have broad access to the Internet, cell phones are ubiquitous, and there are millions of foreigners living there. There is also a considerable number of infections outside China, and the mortality figures seem in line with what we're hearing from that country. Having said all that, for the practical reasons outlined above, there gotta be far more infections than confirmed with lab tests; no cover-up required for that.

  * There's also plenty of people mixing up or intentionally misinterpreting case fatality rates (CFRs) to reach apocalyptic conclusions. A CFR of 2% does *not* mean that 2% of the world's population might die if the pandemic gets out of control; it just means that this percentage of deaths is expected for cases that are confirmed and are tracked medically. This likely skews very heavily toward patients who are in a rough shape to begin with, whereas the asymptomatic or minimally-affected ones are not counted at all. As a practical example: the Spanish flu had a CFR of about 20%, yet killed ""just"" around 5% of the world's population. In other words, even if all containment efforts fail, your individual risk would be considerably lower than implied by that number alone. Similarly, some folks are peddling theories such as that because not all diagnosed folks have fully recovered yet, the ""true"" CFR is bound to be significantly higher. There's nothing to support that.

  * Pandemic scares in the West happen every 2-3 years: SARS, MERS, West Nile, swine flu, avian flu, Zika, Ebola, and so on. Most of them turn out to be of relatively little consequence. This one might or might not be more serious; and so, any plans you devise must take into account the 90%+ probability that it does not become a doomsday event - and that the whole scenario is gonna play out again in the not-too-distant future. Any strategy you can't afford to repeat in two years is probably not a good one.
  
  * By far the best way to reduce your odds of getting infected is to avoid crowds. This includes public transit / air travel, grocery stores, schools, workplaces, churches, parties, sporting events, healthcare facilities, and so on. Unfortunately, this is not practical for most - but skipping or rescheduling non-essential events or travel may be a solid precaution to take. If you can't avoid crowded places, disposable N95 respirators offer some protection when fitted properly - read the instructions! - as does washing your hands and trying not to touch your face (we do this a lot more than we think). You don't need a hazmat suit, a CBRN facepiece, or gallons of bleach.

  * At this point, the risk to most people in Europe and in the US is very modest - with frequent travelers and healthcare professionals likely being among the most vulnerable populations. That said, if a cluster of cases is discovered within 50-100 miles of your location, it might be a good moment to step up the game.
  
  * In all likelihood, special diets or supplements are not going to keep you safe; Big Pharma is not trying to suppress the information about the virus-fighting power of Bob's patented hemp tincture, it's more likely that Bob is a bit of a nutter. For keeping your immune system in a tip-top shape, some of the least controversial ideas include getting adequate sleep, eating reasonably well, and avoiding undue stress. And if you ever come down with the virus, it does seem to have a modest mortality rate - so good hygiene, good nutrition, and a warm bed is likely all you're going to need to stay alive. 

  * It's interesting to note that the other coronavirus-caused would-be-pandemic - SARS - also originated in China under similar circumstances. The 2002-2003 outbreak involved 7,083 known cases and 648 deaths in China and Hong Kong (~10% CFR), with hundreds more diagnosed in Canada and in the US. It led to large-scale containment efforts worldwide, with fairly extreme measures taken across much of Asia. In the end, the outbreak fizzled out, and no new cases have been reported since 2004. The 2019-nCoV thing appears to be more virulent but considerably less lethal than SARS.

  * Finally, for folks who are wary of the reports from China: here's a [published case study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191) of a patient treated in Washington. Except for upset stomach, the progression of the case reads very much like a mild flu that lasted about 8-10 days, with moderate fever, fatigue, and persistent (dry) cough. The most significant event was a brief period with lower blood oxygen saturation (90%), which is not great, but happens in respiratory illness and is not immediately life-threatening. The treatment was largely supportive (ibuprofen, OTC expectorant), although they also gave the person saline IV and oxygen (out of an abundance of caution) and then dicked around with antibiotics (with no effect) and an experimental antiviral drug (with uncertain results).

Please let me know if there's anything worth adding or correcting here."

1. The given the number of cases has been rapidly rising, adding approximately 20% per day, and the incubation period is up-to 14 days. To get the mortality rate (notwithstanding the issue of unreported cases) you need to divide the dead by the number of cases 14 days ago. Doing that you get: 549 / 2500 = 20%... OK, that's a worst case, if we allow a 7 day incubation period you still get to 5% (of the group who have been tested and found to have the virus).
2. The larger the group who recover spontaneously without needing treatment, the more likely the disease will spread, as if the authorities don't know they exist they can't be quarantined.
3. The diseases low on the virulence chart you provided are some of the world's biggest killers. Whereas the traditionally scary viruses, like Ebola, have only killed 1,500 in total, ever; Flu has killed hundreds of millions, and would have killed hundreds of millions more if it wasn't for effective vaccines, the likes of which don't exist for the Coronavirus.

So no, it's not as dangerous as SARS, Ebola or any of those diseases. And that's why we should be worried about it."

It is beginning to look like a global outbreak is an inevitability. 

The objective for international governments is shifting to slow the spread as much as possible, so their respective healthcare systems can keep up with the case load.

It's a pretty high performing build, but we can go lower if u want

10s2p 30q battery w/ a bms. You could go 12s, but 10s is more than enough. This one lacks some range nowadays, but for testing purposes, it'll do. 30q is a pretty nice/common battery with minimal voltage sag. You can find these packs on any Chinese esk8 company selling them individually, like wowgo

Dual 6354 190kv motors. 63mm is a nice, ubiqutous motor size for futureproofing, you could expand to 6374s or 63100s on the same mounts in the future.

Dual vescs 4.2 capable of at least 50a continuous. You can buy a 6.6 vesc capable of 100a, but that's extra money too. 

Remote: flipsky remotes are pretty nicesu. Vx1 for that classic boosted feel in the hand, vx2 for the display.

Deck: something stiff and not too dropped for an easy single enclosure build

Mounts and trucks: you can easily mess up and irreversibly ruin your mounts and trucks, from applying threadlocker to securing the set screws in the trucks. Idk how secure it is, but evolve/ownboard dkp trucks have clamps that are integrated in the trucks and 3rd party motor mounts have 3 points that won't permit sliding. In you want inward mounting on reverse kingpin trucks, there are enertion clone mounts and torqueboard mounts, etc

Wheels and pulleys. I'd suggest flywheel pulleys simply because you can fit abec flywheels, chinese flywheels with wider contact patches, massive cloudwheel, and more. With a kegel setup, you're mostly limited to longboardish wheels, but torqueboard and other companies have some nice kegel wheels on offer too.

Most of this stuff can be found on flipsky, consider coronavirus delays."

The true fatality rate is probaby somewhere in the middle of the 2% (calculated by total deaths to total confirmed cases) and the catastrophic 30ish% rate (calculated by total recoverd to total dead)
 
It appears that this new coronavirus will probably be less fatal than SARS which had a 10% fatality rate (but has already proven more infectious than SARS). It is much more severe than the flu that it is often compared too.  
Since we are in the middle of this epidemic it is still too early to really know the true numbers"

By the end of June SARS was considered erridicated in China. Yet in January of 04 there was a reemergence of SARS in China but by June of that year, the country was considered SARS-free by the WHO. Note: SARS was never cured, it was erridicated through quarantines, strict hygiene protocols and global cooperation.

 

We can't say if the coronavirus will be the same as SARS but one thing is crucially different, China is being more transparent about this illness than SARS. SARS was discovered by a Canadian NGO scanning the internet and finding chat rooms discussing hospital closings and deaths in the ground zero of SARS, Guangzhou. The WHO found out through an email to their Beijing office: ""Am wondering if you have information on the strange contagious disease...which has already left 100 people dead. The outbreak is not allowed to be made known to the public...but people are already aware...and there is a “panic” attitude."" The WHO approached and confronted China about the disease the next day.

China has been more transparent about the situation this time around. I am not saying they are doing everything well but they learned some lessons in sharing information at least globally (with their own people, that is up for debate). This already gives the planet a better start, plus we have folks working on potential cures.

Is your dad elderly? Immunocompromised? This heightens the risk but please remember that China is a large country so if the Chinese man was not from Wuhan, there is a risk, albeit small, that he came in contact with someone carrying the virus and passed it on. Encourage your family to wash their hands frequently, cover their mouths when coughing, and if they feel ill to see a doctor sooner than later. Many people are recovering because of their promptness to seek medical attention.

2019-nCoV reportedly [shares 79.5% of its genome with the SARS virus](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/mining-coronavirus-genomes-clues-outbreak-s-origins).

And SARS is known to be transmitted by *droplet nuclei* (coughing, sneezing, talking animatedly/shouting, or aerosolization of contaminated bodily fluids, eg. toilet-flushing of urine/feces), as well as via *fomites* (materials contaminated with bodily secretions).

If 2019-nCoV shares similar modes of transmission as SARS CoV, someone moaning/panting/screaming vigorously (even if fakely), giving a blowjob, or even saying plosively *""WOW, you have a BIG POLE !!!""* ^[1] is sufficient to transmit the virus -- especially if the recipient party is within 2m distance^[2] of the infected case.

In the city, supermarkets were emptying fast as panicked shoppers rushed to stock up on provisions. Days earlier, the government had closed Hubei province, the epicenter of the new virus and a nexus of transportation in the center of China.

Keeping the nation’s 1.4 billion people fed is one of the ruling Communist Party’s vital challenges, a task that was tough enough even before the virus, due to an outbreak of swine fever and the effects of decades of pollution and urban expansion. Within days of the panic buying, authorities had opened special thoroughfares for essential food and medical items called “Green Passages.”

“Any food price spike could lead to social unrest, and that’s why the government gives this top priority,” said Ma Wenfeng, senior analyst with Beijing Orient Agri-business Consultant Ltd. “Food is more important, even than masks.”

The measures are working in the capital. A visit to a supermarket in Beijing this week showed that fresh vegetables and fruit, which had been the first to go, are now piled high on shelves.

“We have no worries anymore and we can get anything we need,” said Liu Ying, a woman in her 50s who was shopping at a supermarket in southern Beijing.

relates to How China Keeps 1.4 Billion People Fed as Virus Disrupts Traffic
The Green Passages helped ease prices that had spiked in some areas, Lian Weiliang, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, said in a state broadcast on Monday.

Preventing Prices
Average vegetable prices on Sunday were 3.8% cheaper than their peak last week, Lian said.

Because the outbreak spread around the time of the lunar new year festival, citizens had already stocked enough food for the holidays, so the panic buying at some supermarkets was more “psychological,” said Ma at Beijing Orient.

Moreover, the country has huge reserves of basic grains such as rice and wheat, stored around the country in government silos.

CHINA-HEBEI-HANDAN-CORONAVIRUS-PREVENTION AND CONTROL(CN)

China’s National Administration for Food and Strategic Reserves asked local governments to ensure supplies of grains and edible oil to prevent shortages, panic buying or price spikes, and said it will release items from reserves if necessary. There’s enough rice and wheat in government stockpiles to feed the public for a year, Lian said.

Other products present a bigger challenge. China relies on imports for some foods, especially soybeans and edible oils. It has also boosted imports of pork, one of the nation’s favorite meats, after African swine fever forced the country to cull millions of domestic hogs.

China’s Epic Battle to Feed the World

China’s commerce ministry said the country will boost imports of meat and other products to meet any deficit, while state-owned food companies Cofco and Sinograin have been ordered to resume production to boost supplies, state media Xinhua reported.

The Asian nation agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion a year of U.S. farm products for the next two years, mostly soybeans and meat, as part of the phase-one trade deal signed last month.

CHINA-HEALTH-VIRUS

Still, the coronavirus may temper the nation’s demand for some products. People are eating out less, shunning restaurants along with other public places. Dining venues and food stalls are among the biggest users of pork and other meats as well as products like palm oil.

About 5 kilometers from the supermarket is a street of eateries with a small noodle restaurant. The lights are off and a sign on the door says “closed.” Owner, Ji Jingping is waiting for the government to tell her when she can open again, though that might not make much difference.

“Even if you open, nobody dares to eat outside,” Ji said. “There are many restaurants like us. All the restaurants along the street are closed.” Ji is still paying her 20 employees and 50,000 yuan in monthly rent and says it may be even harder for big restaurants with many workers and expensive rents.

The Lunar New Year holiday has ended, but the streets in Beijing remain mostly deserted. Restaurants, public parks and cinemas are closed. Visitors to supermarkets and citizens going home to their communities now typically need to get their temperatures tested before entering.

Daily Life in Shanghai as Virus Cases Rise Above 28,000

To prevent the spread of the virus, most Chinese provinces banned festival celebrations, parties and dining at restaurants during the biggest holiday of the year. More than a dozen cities and provinces extended the Lunar New Year break by a week as part of these efforts.

“Restaurants are among the businesses that have been hardest hit during the holidays,” said Li Qiang, chief analyst with Shanghai JC Intelligence Co., a private agriculture consulting firm in Shanghai.

Restaurants and retail businesses may have suffered losses of about 500 billion yuan ($71.7 billion) in just seven days during the holidays, according to a report by Ren Zeping, chief economist of China Evergrande Group, a Shenzhen-based developer. That’s about 10% of last year’s total catering revenue of 4.7 trillion yuan.

Ren expects the country’s economic growth to slow to 5% this year due to the drop in demand and production, the impact on investment, higher short-term unemployment and rising prices."

It details an *exact* method in which a Coronavirus could have a delayed cytokine storm (which is what all of these relapses are caused by) using a spliced gene. It tricks the immune system with fairly benign/normal symptoms for a week or so, and then ""sneaks"" itself into cells it wouldn't normally be allowed into. At this point, it induces a significant and rapid release of inflammatory cytokines, which subsequently induces Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and organ failure. Unfortunately there isn't an effective therapy for treating hypercytokinemia like this.

It's coincidental that it was published from the Wuhan around the same time the infection started, but it may explain some of these relapses and the serious, often fatal, cases of hypercytokinemia occuring in late stage illness in otherwise young and healthy patients.

The Communist Party of China has been accused of underreporting coronavirus cases and deaths, and late Saturday evening (Feb. 1), the Chinese news service Tencent may have accidentally leaked real data on Wuhan virus deaths, according to Taiwan News.

According to the Taiwan News,  Tencent showed confirmed cases of coronavirus in China at 154,023 on its webpage “Epidemic Situation Tracker.” That number is 10 times the official figure at the time. Tencent listed the number of suspected cases as 79,808, four times the official figure.

Most ominously, the death toll listed was 24,589, vastly higher than the 300 officially listed that day.

The number of cured cases was only 269.

Even MORE significant..

QUOTE – Another strange phenomenon that netizens have noticed is the mortality rate, as the government death tolls are routinely maintaining an exact percentile for days on end. Many noticed that in the early days of reporting, the government put the death rate at 3.1 percent.

Jan. 22: 17 deaths / 542 infections = 3.1 percent

Jan. 23: 26 deaths / 830 infections = 3.1 percent

Jan. 24: 41 deaths / 1,287 infections = 3.1 percent

By late January, the government apparently decided to set the new official mortality rate at 2.1 percent. As can be seen in the image below, the mortality rate was kept at a precise 2.1 percent, regardless of the numbers from Jan. 30 to Feb. 3:

>According to a widely shared post on Weibo, a popular social media site, “conditions were very poor” at an exhibition center that had been converted into a quarantine facility. There were power failures and electric blankets could not be turned on, the user wrote, citing a relative who had been taken there, saying that people had to “shiver in their sleep.”

>There was also a staff shortage, the post said, where “doctors and nurses were not seen to be taking note of symptoms and distributing medicine,” and oxygen devices were “seriously lacking.”

>On January 9, virologists and other public health researchers identified the strain as a novel coronavirus, which was tied to a specific “wet market” in the city of Wuhan where they sell fish and other live animals.

>**These markets have been known to transmit viruses before. For cultural reasons in the region, people want to see the specific animals they’re buying be slaughtered in front of them, so they know they’re receiving the products they paid for. That means there’s a lot of skinning of dead animals in front of shoppers and, as a result, aerosolizing of all sorts of things, which is why these crowded markets are common places for viruses to jump from animals to people.** It’s actually how SARS, another coronavirus, started in 2003.

Or create a vavcine. Hence ""there is no cure for the common cold"". Sic. (No, there is no vaccine. A vaccine isn't a *cure*, which is the main misunderstanding people have about them)

It makes more sense to only classify respiratory illness strains that set themselves apart for their virulence. Like this specific Coronavirus.

While 2% mortality rates don't sound significant, it's important to remember that a cold in and of itself isn't likely to kill you. Just like the flu in and of itself isn't likely to kill you. It's really their propensity to overwhelm the immune system so that other bacterial infections set in (sepsis, pneumonia) that sets certain flu and cold strains apart. 

E.g., while influenza A is currently the most typical flu you're likely to contract, and so the current vaccine features inactive vira from the A strain, there are likely 20-30 strains out there, meaning that the vaccine might only be between 20 and 70 % effective, depending on the frequency of less common strains *also* going around. But the effectiveness is still there because other strains are different from but also similar to influenza A. Insofar as how similar a different strain is, that affects how well a body will respond to a new flu infection. 

Now, if you had influenza A and another Boris recombine to make a very virulent but very abundant new vira, it would make it necessary to identify it separately and create a new iteration of the flu vaccine that takes into account the variation. That's why from year to year a flu vaccine carries at least two strains of vira to inoculate the body with. 

(Note: **vira** is the Latin plural for virus. I much prefer it to ""viruses"" because it leads much better towards *viral*, i.e. the adjective form of virus.)"

However, if you needed to go outside, a mask would be insufficient by itself: you would need to observe correct infection control measures (gloves, removal of outer clothing and shoes before entering a ""clean"" area etc..).

Seven patients were in quarantine and the disease symptoms reminded him of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome). He urged colleagues to wear protective clothing at work.

Four days later he was summoned to the local public security bureau, accused of “making false comments” and disturbing the social order. He was told that if he continued to talk about the disease, he would be “brought to justice”.

Li was one of eight people targeted by authorities for “sharing false information”, in a heavy-handed approach that was later criticised by China’s supreme court. He agreed not to discuss his concerns in public again.

But in early January he treated a woman with glaucoma without realising she was also a coronavirus patient; he appears to have been infected during the operation.

On the 10 January, when China was still insisting there had been no new cases for a week, he started coughing then developed a fever. Two days later he was in hospital; his parents also fell ill.

Before he died, Li, who had a child and was expecting a second this summer, had broken his silence to give interviews from his hospital bed.

“If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency,” he told the New York Times."

I received bad news from my sister who's a PR in SG. She's a very calm rational person and she's not panicking so far. She lives relatively close to the first local transmission case in Bukit Merah, yet when the news broke, she wasn't panicking. Well that changed until just now. Her meeting today with client was cancelled, apparently there's someone in her client's department (SingTel), had had direct contact with one of the confirmed case. If the test comes back positive, they'll begin contact tracing. This suspected person works closely with my sister's client; said client just had presentation with my sister's boss few days ago, and my sister was discussing the project to her boss today. It's a long shot I know, but I can sense she's kinda worried over this (she asked me to buy masks after she told me she still has enough masks there). The thing is she's gonna come home (Indonesia) in a week to attend her friend's wedding, and she said if she started having symptoms next week she won't fly home. We decided to keep this secret from our mom since she's been looking forward to see my sister next week, we don't wanna make her worry.

Also, CCP has quaratined entire cities within their borders. This is a sensible measure to take to stop the spread of a pandemic. Refusing entry from people who have recently traveled to affect regions is a valid strategy to minimize the possibility of spreading the pandemic.

I have my own opinions about carricature artists, an art style that purposefully exaggerate & minimizes elements for 'artistic' purposes. This combination of 'art' and 'comedy' is very debatable, and controversial, but I do think it falls under 'freedom-of-speech' articles because it doesn't explicitly target a race (but does a government) and doesn't promote violence in any way. Any interpretations or extrpolations that say/imply it does is more a reflection of the person than the 'art/comedy' piece.

Unfortunately, we are all subject to personal biasis, we cannot be held accountable for subconcious biasis we are not aware of, but once it is identified then it should be kept in mind to not allow it to control our behaviors. Even worse, racism and expression of racist ideology is allowed under freedom of speech articles as long as it doesn't encourage violence. This is the worst part of freedom of speech but freedom of speech also allows companies, people, and news to report critical information & commentary of their own government without fear of government retaliation.

The 2019–20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, formally the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is an ongoing viral epidemic primarily affecting Mainland China, along with isolated cases in 27 other countries and territories. In early December 2019 a new coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV, was identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, after 41 people developed pneumonia without a clear cause (2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease). The virus is capable of spreading from person to person. The incubation period (time from exposure to onset of symptoms) ranges from 2 to 14 days, but it may be contagious during this period and after recovery.

I was walking through the airport with my girlfriend and a group of Asians (10-12) were walking toward us all wearing masks.   I told her to keep her distance given the Coronavirus outbreak.  She immediately responded that I was being racist.  I told her that the chances that the group came from Asia are high because we are at the airport, they are (1) Asian and (2) wearing masks.  If I saw a group of people of any race coming off a plane from Asia (or it was a possibility the plane was from Asia) wearing masks I would avoid them.  While the chances we get infected walking by are probably slim to none I didn't want to risk it.  It's not hard to move over 10 feet.  AITA?

It was opening up, opportunity was abounding, things were going the right way. We all know that the CCP has been a piece of shit since it began but maybe it had turned a corner, we thought. Now I know better. 

I can't wait to leave this place. I'm honestly chomping at the bit to get out of China and am counting down the days until it happens. The CCP lies about *everything*. I don't think they've ever told the truth about even the most mundane things. I see it firsthand how they lied about everything from Hong Kong to Xinjiang. I see how they teach lies in their education system about China's history under their rule. I see them currently lying about the coronavirus (although it remains to be revealed. But we all know it's way worse than they're saying) 

The CCP is a self-serving abomination bent on controlling every thought you have. Only now that you can get information from sources that aren't strained through the CCP filter can you see what a piece of shit the ruling body of China actually is. 

Just you wait...it gets worse. You have no idea the level of propaganda and utter BS you've been fed your entire life all to convince you that China can't survive without the CCP. Utter nonsense. Go ahead though...look up important events in China from the past 70 years and see if the information from independent sources backs up what you were taught in school. Sometimes it will and sometimes it won't but one thing you can be sure of is that when something really bad happened in China and the CCP fucked it up (as it does) you've never heard that side of the story."

“Those who can get diagnosed and treated are the lucky ones,” Mr. Long said. “In our neighborhood, many who weren’t able to get diagnosed ended up dying at home.”
Getting treatment for the coronavirus in a hospital requires jumping through a number of hoops.
According to official guidelines, patients are encouraged to go to their local hospitals first for initial assessments and sometimes prescriptions. Then patients are to deliver the results to their local neighborhood committees, which are responsible for communicating with the hospitals and coordinating resources for the households in their areas. There are about 1,000 neighborhood committees in Wuhan, for a population of 11 million.

Patients with mild symptoms are typically told to go home and self-quarantine, according to a Jan. 24 notice by city officials. Those who have more severe symptoms are flagged by the neighborhood committees, which arrange for transportation by ambulance to one of the two dozen or so hospitals designated for treating the coronavirus.
But in practice, patients and their relatives say that the process takes far too long, and that the bar for what constitutes “severe symptoms” has been set too high — so they give up and try waiting in long lines at hospitals instead."

(Highly preventative, barely curative.) Check the examine.com article for an overview of solid studies.

It is untested for this coronavirus. (No surprise, there - this virus is brand new, and we are not going to feed people garlic and then expose them on purpose!)

It is healthy for you, regardless, so no harm done either way.

Is it 100 % protection? Absurdly unlikely, do not rely on it!

Does it help? Probably, actually.

Do we have solid evidence? Not yet.

WHO stated just that, because they worried people in China would merely eat garlic, believe themselves safe, and not use disinfectant, which is much more solidly proven protection.

Now Western media are picking this up and twisting it like we know for certain garlic won't do a thing and Chinese medicine people recommending it are idiots. It infuriates me.

For any Chinese medicine, check how it has done in studies, particularly large, replicated, placebo controlled, double blind studies, and judge it on that - not in whether it is herbal and whether the people who discovered this also believed in bullshit. Some Chinese medicine works and can aid Western medicine in significant ways that can save lives. Some does literally nothing, and taking it instead of Western medicine that is proven to work will get you killed. Some is actually inherently harmful, for everyone (e.g. literally toxic) or some (e.g. you do not want to give a working immune booster to people with auto-immune disease).

Looking at the thread, it seems like your concern is WHY are they lying to public, but you need to ask if they ARE lying in the first place, \[I am not saying they are/aren’t, may be they are, may be they aren’t\]

While you seem to be on the camp who would argue that an effectiveness anything better than 0% is effective, there will be some counterargument that anything with an effectiveness less than 100% is ineffective. It’s a matter of where you are looking at it from.

I see you said “First of all, all medical staff wear them. They’re not infected, they’re wearing them to help prevent getting infected. If it was so “ineffective”, then why bother?” 

Well at this point the general expert concessions about the transmission of the virus is that you contract it when you are in close contact with a carrier. Close contact is someone who has been face to face for at least 15 minutes, or been in the same closed space for at least 2 hours, with someone who has tested positive for the novel coronavirus when that person was infectious. 

Now for a medical staff, s/he is at a disproportionately risky position compared to you. They are being exposed to it over 8 hours a shift, so every little bit helps. You on the other hand living in a country where there are less than 35 people living per sq km, you might not even come in close contact with a carrier if you aren’t extremely unlucky, and by close contact I mean being face to face for 15 min, or be in the same closed place for 2 hours. Practicing good hygiene would probably be much more effective if you don’t want to contract the virus."

**The state of play:** Positive cases have now been confirmed in **20 of 102 people tested** aboard the Princess Cruises ship, according to the ministry. Officials are still carrying out tests on those aboard the vessel, which was carrying some 3,700 people.

* Princess Cruises [said in a statement](https://www.princess.com/news/notices_and_advisories/notices/diamond-princess-update.html) nine of the [first 10 patients hospitalized](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/tyoukanpress/202002/5_a.html) from the ship were guests — one from the U.S., two Australians, three Japanese people and three from Hong Kong. A Filipino crew member also tested positive.
* The nationalities of the latest cases have yet to be released, but half of those on board were guests from Japan, per Princess Cruises.

>*The length of the quarantine will be at least 14 days as required by the Ministry of Health.""*

**The big picture:** A guest from Hong Kong sailed from Yokohama on Jan. 20 before disembarking back home on Jan. 25, Princess Cruises said. **He showed no symptoms aboard the ship, but tested positive for coronavirus in a Hong Kong hospital six days later**. The Japanese government spokesman said nearly 300 of those on the ship had undergone tests for the virus so far."

2020-02-06,Hoffglubin,science,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ezstsw/science_discussion_series_the_novel_coronavirus/fgpvjat/,"Great questions! I’ll do my best to answer them.
1) It depends on the virus and the exposure to antivirals. Something like HIV where it has a very high mutation rate and is being berated with drugs is going to have developed more resistance. However, this virus doesn’t have an antiviral (more on the mutation rate later)

2) The current scientific consensus on viral pathogenesis over time is that they actually get attenuated or weaker in a population. 

3) There is actually a lot of variation with viruses but they can be put in two camps that each have certain commonalities: viruses with DNA genomes and viruses with RNA genomes (a genome being the sum of the genetic material). One big difference between the two is their mutation rate. DNA viruses have a much lower mutation rates because they have access to proofreading mechanisms in the cell which RNA viruses do not. For this reason RNA viruses have much smaller genomes than DNA viruses and much higher mutation rates. Coronaviruses (a family of viruses) are the odd balls because they are RNA viruses but have DNA sized genomes! They can do this because they encode their own proofreader which is really strange. As a side note this proofreader was the target for the SARS (another Coronavirus) vaccine - vaccines often have an attenuated version of the virus. But to answer your question Coronaviruses have a relatively low mutation rate especially since it is a RNA virus."

Immediately went to walgreens and bought Nasal Saline Spray, Vitamin C, and started gargling salt water every hour (my usual routine if I feel like I'm getting sick).

Then after work I went to the gym and the gym owner was spraying things down telling me he wants to make sure there is no coronavirus here (he's another freaker outer). My anxiety was so bad on the way home that I went to the store and bought some whiskey. Proceed to have a few drinks, felt better and went to sleep.
