But as of the government dealing with the situation at hand, the process has been very transparent and efficient. 

This is in stark contrast to its immediate neighbours : China with its censorship and corrupt authoritarianism, and even Japan with its rigid bureaucracy and an unwillingness to face the problem head on- worried about the Olympics. The cruise ship quarantine was an absolute mess not properly taken care of just to prevent cases on the ship being added to Japan's official tally, and it's been revealed that several dozen workers that recently left the quarantine zone haven't even been tested before returning to their homes across Japan. 

These cases being swept under the rug in Japan should be of much higher concern than Korea's recent spike in cases, which are being dealt with seriously."

I cried, had severe anxiety attacks, and even my sister distanced herself from me because of my “negativity”. People are in denial. The second I saw this virus I knew in my heart I’d be affected even if it was thousands of miles away in China at that time. The warnings and the news being posted here ahead of time, has me in the stage of acceptance and adaptability at this point. Prepared as well for a whole month of food, and still going to be prepare some more if time allows it. 

I live in LA, so I know for a fact things will get very bad here. However, I feel more at peace. I feel very at peace with whatever comes my way - whether death or not everything will be okay. I spoke to my mom today and she understood where I’m coming from. I just hope my other family can cope with this, and find wisdom in these dire times as well. Being spiritually centered is so important. Thank you for this post. 💜 

All I tell people is to eat good, exercise, and keep living your life. Yes you will have to adapt. Yes this sucks. Yes you will see tough shit. But not all things are JUST darkness, because there is duality. There is light even in darkness. They are one and the same - as is life and death. We have to understand these principles fundamentally to adjust. Everything will be okay. The storm shall pass. It won’t be eternal. We don’t know when, but let’s ride it out. Cheers! 🍻"

That's why they don't over react to strange particles or viruses that they never seen before. Something with their developing thymus. In adults, it's the opposite.

2020-02-23,HistoryDave,Coronavirus,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f84c19/covid19_outbreak_will_test_canadas_hospital/fij4r2m/,"I don't want to sugarcoat this -- Canada's system clearly lacks necessary resources and, depending on the speed that this hits us, that's going to cause a hell of a lot of pain -- but at the same time a lot still comes down to how well managed the available resources are:

>He envisions that a disease like COVID-19, if it spread widely, would have a major impact, including the possibility of cancelled surgeries and moving stable patients out of hospitals who would otherwise stay.   
>  
>“I think there would have to be hard decisions made about who lives and who dies, given our limited availability by both speciality and (intensive-care) beds and we would probably see some degree of health-care rationing,” he says.

I fear he is right, but there is a world of difference between the scenario envisioned in that first paragraph and the one envisioned in the second. He's correct: there are a lot of stable patients, namely seniors waiting for long-term care beds, taking up hospital real estate. In the event of a pandemic we need to make risk and benefit decisions about who needs that space more and about whether those seniors could be relatively safely moved elsewhere.

Moreover, stressed as our system may be, from a standing start we still have significantly more nurses, doctors, and probably pretty much all quantitative measures than the Chinese system, so we should be able to hold out a little bit longer. I realize the pat answer is ""But our system is already stressed to the brink!"" and while that's true, it's also true in China, I would guess."

Google translate from Yonhap article:

The government will greatly strengthen the response system by raising the crisis alert to the highest level of seriousness, according to the recommendations of infectious disease experts,"" Moon said.

Mr. Moon said, ""The situation before and after the new mass group infection that is happening in a large scale is completely different."" ""We will respond more fully to the government and strengthen the support system of the central government and local governments.""

He emphasized that ""do not be bound by regulations and hesitant to respond unprecedentedly strong.""


 
President Moon also said that he would like to mobilize all the measures necessary for early stabilization for Daegu and Qingdao, Gyeongbuk.

In particular, President Moon said, ""We are taking special measures against Shinchon believers who are the source of group infections. We are conducting a full investigation and diagnosis."" ""The increase is going to be very calm.""

Subsequently, it was a natural and inevitable step for local communities not only in Daegu but also to temporarily shut down Shincheonji facilities, conduct a full survey of new members, and manage them.

President Moon said, ""It is not to restrict the freedom of religious activities, but to protect the lives and safety of local residents and the people, and to protect the safety of Shincheonji believers."" .

""The same is true of other religions and general groups,"" he said. ""I urge you to refrain from self-controlling group events or activities that are harmful to the general public, both indoors and outdoors.""

President Moon said, “I would especially like to express my condolences and encouragement to the people of Daegu and Gyeongbuk. The nation and the people will be with you.” He promised that he will spare no support as a special management area.

President Moon said, “You must effectively join the efforts of the government, local governments, and medical staff to effectively prevent local infections.” ""We can win and trust and cooperation are the way to win the fight against viruses."""

There's a psych concept called the ""Overton Window"", it's the limits of what people are willing to think about (or talk about) at any given time. COVID is out of bounds for a lot of people right now.

But if/when the news gets a bit more dire, when WHO says ""pandemic"" or when local events start getting canceled, a lot of people are going to wake up. They're going to have the OMG moment like we did but not nearly as early as we did.  They're not going to have as much time to catch up.

I had tag review turned on, but it was just too much. He’d also comment all kinds of nonsense on my posts..

Anyway, a friend of his who probably got the same batch of drugs he did ended up calling the DHS and telling them that the CIA has been trying to contact him via satellite (something to that effect). He also used the Internet.

I can definitely see somebody just saying that they have friends/family in high up places to make their ramblings seem more legit.

To be fair though, I do think we will see a recession with that time frame. I saw an economic analyst talking about how the recent dips aren’t really concerning because the markets are still up 30% from 3 years ago even WITH the recent correction due to the coronavirus.

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College---COVID-19---Relative-Sensitivity-International-Cases.pdf

>**Consistent with similar analyses [3], we estimated that about two thirds of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have remained undetected worldwide, potentially leaving sources of human-to-human transmission unchecked** (63% and 73% undetected based on comparisons with Singapore only and with Singapore, Finland, Nepal, Belgium, Sweden, India, Sri Lanka, and Canada, respectively). Undoubtedly, the exported cases vary in the severity of their clinical symptoms, making some cases
more difficult to detect than others. However, some countries have detected significantly fewer than would have been expected based on the volume of flight passengers arriving from Wuhan City, China. 

I think Imperial's latest figures point to 1/3 detection whereas previous numbers were higher. Still, if 78000 current confirmed cases are 1/3, the total could be over 230,000 cases in China alone."

I've always been a nutjob survivalist kind of guy ... we have a comfortable 3 months of supplies of all sorts; significantly longer if rationed.  Water in particular - a year, at least *even if it does not rain in that year.*

The next paragraph holds a proviso - I don't endorse 'militarist' survivalism but:

I don't have a firearm because I'm not in America.  If I was, however, I probably would.  I do have at least one weapon hidden in every room in the house meaning I can eliminate an attacker with hidden items all over the place (just hope the cops don't check... but we don't have any criminal record nor do we have any friends or family on that side of society).

Key is that by all reports (as unfounded/untrustworthy as they may be) this isn't hitting kids or healthy adults.

You can't outrun a pandemic.  You can outlive it, however.  Shit, getting infected *early* is in your interest - while you are strong, and (more importantly) while the authorities are relaxed and while the medical system is at standard operation.

If it kills you, it kills you.  If it doesn't, it doesn't.  I know that sounds ... I dunno ... nihilistic? ... but that's the way this is.  Prepare for what you can control.

You were going to get a secondary site not a hospital room. You basically were going to be left to die with minimal care and supplies Also care would be rationed to working age productive members of society getting first dibs. Then the worst part was how Tamiflu was to be allocated along with PPEs. Government officials and big business executives were above healthcare personnel They were going to keep schools open for one thing. They didn't want to wait for vaccine production. Closing schools would have meant someone would have had to miss working to care for the children at home. So sacrificing children's lives for the sake of the GDP was the plan.

Or are you talking about the devices that cover shrimp in batter?  Yeah, I saw that on ""How It's Made"", wonderful show, that is... ;)

But yes, World War I was notable for a complete lack of breadin' machines.

Although we have vastly improved medicine and medical procedures compared to 100 years ago, and antibiotics will be useful for secondary infections, there are still no magic bullets for viral infections.

As for intensive care, the entire European continent had a bit over  73 thousand critical care beds in 2012,^[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8) while American Hospital Association reported 95 thousand ICU beds in the US in 2015.^[2](https://www.sccm.org/Communications/Critical-Care-Statistics#occupancy) Please note that acute care and intensive care are different classifications, so these numbers are not directly comparable. Nevertheless, these numbers give useful guidance for understanding critical care capacities in some of the richest regions in the world - nowhere near enough for a pandemic scenario.

It's also important to remember that these beds are not sitting unoccupied waiting for a disaster to strike, but in near constant use. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates average of 68% occupancy in the US,^[2](https://www.sccm.org/Communications/Critical-Care-Statistics) while NHS reported 75.4% occupancy in the UK last month (79.6% for paediatric beds).^[3](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/December-19-Monthly-SitRep-SPN-4yAu1.pdf)[PDF] Any significant influx of patients would thoroughly overwhelm either healthcare system.

I'm not taking issue with the idea there may be supply chain disruptions. Just making a big list of every drug that China produces (most if not all which are also produced elsewhere) is incredibly misleading.

You say other things, like ""GlaxoSmithKline has more than 2000 employees in China."" Out of 100,000 employees worldwide, 15,000 of which are in the United States.... 7.5x the number in China. GSK is a British multinational with operations all over the world, if anything it is surprising to me that it has so few employees in China, if it was in proportion to global population you would expect them to have 20,000 employees there. If GSK had a *disproportionate* amount of their business in China, you'd expect it to be higher than that. That it is 1/10th of the number you'd expect if they had a totally proportionate business in China that actually suggests the opposite of your point, that GSK has *less* operations in China, relative to the rest of the world.

Additionally- the drugs industry in China is not all in Wuhan. As you say yourself, ""China has thousands of drug manufacturers, mostly small factories scattered across the nation."" Now while there are certainly disruptions throughout China, the entire country has not shut down. I live in a neighbouring Asian country, I know people who were here on holiday from China for the New Year, and they had an extended New Year break but have now gone back to work. I have orders from China myself that were stuck with this shutdown but that have now started to arrive. There are massive disruptions but the entire country is not locked down.

There is some more, perhaps less sensationalist coverage of this here, where they cover these issues:

>Many companies do have manufacturing plants in China, though mostly for the local market. For example, Merck & Co. has a facility in Hangzhou that supplies drugs to China and other Asian countries. ...

>In contrast, many generic players source APIs in China. This means these companies are more vulnerable to the situation there. **Most API producers are located in provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang along the east coast of China, far from Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak** ...

>The coronavirus outbreak has already pushed up API prices in India as companies stock up amid a decline in supply. The problem could also apply to the U.S., given China’s status as a major producer of APIs of antibiotics and vitamins.

>But as Moody’s noted, **several key generic players in the U.S. market, including Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Mylan and Teva, manufacture a lot of their own APIs in the U.S. and Europe.** “Supply disruptions in China could benefit these companies, which would be able to raise prices if one or more of their competitors is sidelined,” the financial analytics company said in the report.

https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma-asia/coronavirus-has-mixed-impacts-for-u-s-biopharmas-moody-s-says-here-s-why

>China, as the largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the world, is the starting point in the global supply chain for many products. 

>China’s WuXi Biologics announced this week it has restarted production at three sites. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot in a call with media said production at its two sites has resumed and they were nearly up to full speed, Bloomberg reports. 

>“So far, we’ve had relatively limited disruption to our activities,” Soriot said. “We’ll get past this epidemic and China will remain a very important part of our company.”

>But in an emergency meeting in Brussels, concerns about shortages were raised by health ministers from France and Finland, CTGN reports. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said her group has a task force monitoring supplies, and, for now, no shortages are in evidence. ...

>In India, which gets two-thirds of its APIs from China, the government determined drugmakers have about two-months supply on hand, the Indian Express reports. That is particularly important to the U.S. since the FDA estimates that India accounts for 40% of the U.S. generics.

There are many poor people here who can't afford education, safe to say there are thoudands of those from small villages who are 18+ and only primary or middle school graduate. Agents who put these people to work as maids in other country often take advantage of them. If they break the contract before it's done, most of the time they would be left with huge amount of loans. Worse, some of these agents are in charge of receiving their salary. Most maids abroad have accounts in Indonesian bank so their families in village can draw and use their salaries for daily life needs. These accounts, are usually handled by their agents. If they break the contract or run away, their family in Indonesia might suffer too as the agent could easily seize the money. We all here know it's like a slave industry.

People keep confusing the measures taken by different local govs and even neighborhoods. My parents' neighborhood has different rules from the one across the street. Not everyone is locked in their apartment in China. Actually until several days ago even people in Wuhan could leave their apartments freely.


The lockdown in Wuhan was very poorly coordinated and poorly prepared, thus causing a lot of, if not most of the problems. And to be honest Wuhan was in such a bad state at the very beginning, that it was not possible to implement it as strictly as elsewhere. There is no point in following it in any other countries because other cities are less infected and more prepared.

The lockdowns in other Chinese cities might work but I don't have a survey for the measures taken and don't know what's the infection state in each cities. 


For example my parents' and grandparents' cities have no enough medical supplies, but also only imported infections+small family clusters, so there are no neighborhood lockdown at all until days ago and it was only in some of the neighborhoods. Villages do not allow outsiders. Schools, theaters, factories are closed. Temperate is taken when you enter and leave the neighborhoods. Sometimes masks are required when taking public transits. That's hardly draconian and enough imo for most places without a major outbreak(no big local clusters)."

Gauging by some of the strawman arguments being brought by those who would prefer to ignore all of this, I think most people don't understand that a virus is only containable if you do a full court press from the very beginning.

It's a bit too late to try to contain it when it's in dozens of countries with hundreds of infected in each country.  Even if some countries get it under control, the whole thing becomes a whack-a-mole at best, and just evolves to a full out pandemic at worst.

There may come a time when the more intelligent among the know-nothings will regret letting the chance to contain this slip through our fingers in the name of ""I'm so chill."""

In reality there are problems such as:

1. No beds/quarantine spots available so reporting doesn't help much(seems to be less of the problems recently for ncov patients, and more for non-ncov patients)

2. It relies a lot on the efficiency of the local management. Some neighborhoods just do it via Wechat and old people might not be able to access the info. Some people say nobody ever contact them;

3. As mentioned before, old people might not have access to the resources and self-help groups so food, med might be a huge issue for them."

In Vietnam, all the people in close contact with the confirmed cases were quarantined. Back in January, the temperature in the north was sub-20, while the south was above 20. In Vĩnh Phúc, a northern province, a patient started a cluster and infected 6 people in that quarantine commune. In Nha Trang and HCMC, both southern provinces and cities, the first Chinese national case infected only his son and a hotel staff, and the Vietnamese American case didn't infect anyone.


Singapore may be an exception in that AC use is widespread and central HVAC is common place in buildings. This means that air ventilation is poor (HVAC is known to have contributed to the transmission of SARS) and the actual temperature these people live in is likely lower than the ambient temperature and sub-20."

COVID19 is much the same way. If you completely recover, unless there is mutation/evolution in the virus, you cannot be reinfected without being some extreme edge case. In other words, either the person suffering from it again:

- didn't actually recover and is relapsing (most likely)

- don't have the same strain and this virus is much more dangerous than it already was (unlikely and hopeful thinking)

- is an extreme edge case and completely recovered the first time and is going through it again anew (should be extremely rare)

I ask you to look at the budgets yourself.  As of now, he has literally not changed anything since the Obama era.  Actually added for Zica.  The CDC is just a below average federal agency that can’t even get testing kits to states with infected people.  I don’t see how that is the presidents fault.

Big cities will get ugly very fast. I grew up in a small town, now live in a big city so I’ve seen both sides of people. If it were a natural disaster, I think the taking care of each other would apply to larger places, but unfortunately with a virus like this, man vs man. While our healthcare is private, and we do have a good number of doctors, nurses, and medical professionals like EMT’s, heck even medical school people, we need the chain of command to guide them, make sure ordering from abroad is happening, and things needed are absolutely getting to where they need to be. Canadians (from what I’ve seen and from friends) aren’t the happiest with their government but there is a higher level of trust for them than here. It’s just my opinion with what I’ve seen in my lifetime, could be different than most."

The excess of 14 days incubation period is perhaps one in hundred or one in thousand cases, so it will be just fine to keep it at 14 days. And even if you think physically escaping quarantine is impossible, I refer you to instances of escape in Russia. You can certainly encourage high risk cases to stay in quarantine for few extra days just to be sure, but it's probably counterproductive to try and enforce 3 or 4 weeks.

It's more important to make sure the quarantine provides proper isolation so that anyone infected in quarantine can't infect anyone else in quarantine. It seems this failed miserably on Diamond Princess so it's a good thing they were evacuated to better conditions."

Btw—another major problem I’m foreseeing that will make this really difficult for us is the cost of healthcare in our country. How is the average American family going to pay for a few weeks stay in the ICU? It just doesn’t look like this is going to turn out well for the people in the US. I truly can’t think of a worse leader for us to have in a situation like this and the fact that he has such little regard for anything that is science-based—well—I guess we will soon be seeing the impact of that in the coming days."

You voted for a guy who is actively trying to kill you.

When people hear about factors (that some given outcome is more likely,) then they often overvalue that.  Viruses and epidemiology are all statistically based.  There is no all-or-nothing factor, here. 

Having said that there has been constant spread from China (and Hubei) world wide, and there is no good explanation for the distribution of cases (outside China, whereas inside China the city lockdowns explain the distribution perfectly well.)  If there is some statistically aberrant pattern, then there has to be some explanation, and that's either going to be luck, some unrecognized logistical/environmental factor or something to do with the virus (and most likely a combination of all three.)  It took around 4 years to understand the increased prevalence in H1N1/09 in Han Chinese, so its unsurprising we don't have all the answers, now.

So... perhaps? but we won't know the exact details until years later."

2020-02-23,CLO_SIMP,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f879he/italy_reports_34_new_cases_of_coronavirus_raising/fijkrgv/,"Devils advocate ~ UK have tested thousands but only nine cases and eight recovered. Why does Italy have so many but the UK nothing?  To my knowledge UK has a bigger Chinese population too. The same question applies to Canada as well where they have a massive chinese population but very few numbers with the virus. 

Any theories for this? Because other than explaining it off as pure luck I cant and I'd love some opinions."
