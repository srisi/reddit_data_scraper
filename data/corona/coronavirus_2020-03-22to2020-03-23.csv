Big Pharma appears to be fighting to be to the ones to provide treatment for this pandemic, for obvious monetary reasons. They are shilling against the cheap and readily available medicine so they can profit off of the pandemic.

The entire expectation is that we will have a federal lockdown, people will die for a few weeks then the spread will be stunted and eventually peter out like it is in China/S. Korea. Once this happens, they expect back to business as usual and good companies will see their values sky back up. So they are simply trying to buy now while things are ""cheap"".

All this positivity is predicated on a V shaped recovery looming just around the corner. To my mind, none of this answers the question of *what happens when we go back to work?* Which is simply that the coronavirus also comes back. So at best we are going to be in a stop/start cycle with random lockdowns until we have a real solution - and THAT isn't priced in at all.

Alternatively, chart-tards are looking at historical trends and seeing that things seem oversold so they must go back up - completely disregarding whatever is happening in the real world. Because charts. Which is its own special type of autism."

4. QED, your professors are **far** more concerned about this/distracted than you are.

This is why most schools are shifting to pass/fail. The professors don't want to administer and grade that shit any more than you want to take it.

Two weeks ago I shared my U.S. coronavirus tracker and was met with tremendous support 🙏 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffhcol/i\_made\_a\_dedicated\_us\_coronavirus\_tracker\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffhcol/i_made_a_dedicated_us_coronavirus_tracker_that/). Thank you everyone for the feedback. What started off as a weekend project became something I spend most of my waking hours working on while juggling a full-time job. 

I read all your comments and emails but can't respond to them all due to the sheer volume, so I wanted to take the time to share some things I've worked on so far:

* Added 'Cases by County' table that shows updated stats for every affected county/state
* Autodetects what county and state you are in and shows that first in the table
* Added geographical county boundaries on the map to delineate infection zones instead of using arbitrary circles. Boundaries were sourced from the 2018 U.S. Census.
* If it detects you are not in an infection zone, it calculates the closest infected county from you and displays it on the map, including how far away it is and how many cases/deaths the area has.
* As more and more counties are added to the map, it may take more time to calculate this. I'm planning to switch to a faster algorithm soon so this won't be a problem.
* Minified data payloads to improve site load times
* Added a running 24-hour change for nationwide number of cases/deaths/recovered.
* Added log scale option so we can better visualize the cases/deaths on the same chart & analyze the trend of growth.
* Added map legend with 6 colors and ranges. The vast majority of counties are still in the 1-5 cases range so the granularity of the legend is biased toward the lower case counts.
* Started archiving hourly snapshots of county-level data so we can see the change over time in our counties, and this opens up the door for cool animations/visualizations. Many of you wanted a date slider to ""go back in time"" to see how the virus spread visually on the map (cool idea!).
* A bunch of manual fixes to correct geographical quirks
* Added fullscreen map button

&#x200B;

Coming soon:

* 24hr, 7day change for every county - I think this would be very useful to track the trend in our backyards
* \# new cases per day added to chart
* More detailed county-level stats - death rate, population, etc.
* Account for county population and show cases per capita (e.g. 4 in 10,000 ppl in your county is infected)
* National and state-level testing data - # of positive/negative/pending cases.
* Add more colors to the legend to account for counties with much more cases than before (NY!!).
* Recognize independent cities as separate from their surrounding counties (mainly in Virginia, Maryland, Missouri)
* More graphs to visualize the data - growth rate, predictions based off past 5-day curve, etc
* Add field to enter zip code / county name and fly to that location on the map
* Improve map/site load performance

One said: “One is the debate around globalisation. Is Trump right that we just need to build bigger walls, or is Gordon Brown right that global problems need global solutions? The second is Socialism v The Free Market. Large parts of the economy are going to be socialised after this. I fear it leads to nationalists and socialists winning, to national socialism.”

> The third fissure may yet be the worst. “It’s the intergenerational question. It is unsustainable to have people in their youth put their whole life on hold for months while the economy tanks to save a 91-year-old who would have died six months later anyway.”

Under the Goldman Sachs estimate, the jobs gone would total 14 million.

There is a breaking scandal regarding *two* Senators, Richard Burr (Republican - North Carolina) and Kelly Loeffler (Republican - Georgia) allegedly selling stock after receiving early private briefing on COVID 19's dangers. Both of them serve on the Intelligence committee (Burr is the chair). We know they must have received alarming information about COVID 19's potential as Burr [informed a small group of ""well-connected constituents"" at a private luncheon on February 27th.](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818192535/burr-recording-sparks-questions-about-private-comments-on-covid-19). I can only find specifics that [there was a briefing on January 24th](https://twitter.com/DGoforth918/status/1240999607104045059), if anyone knows about additonal specifics please advise.

Neither went on the record to warn the public about the virus based on information briefed in said intelligence committee. Burr had gone on the record *prior to* the luncheon, on February 7th in an op-ed which stated that: [""the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus, in large part due to the work of the Senate Health Committee, Congress, and the Trump Administration.""](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/coronavirus-prevention-steps-the-u-s-government-is-taking-to-protect-you-sen-alexander-and-sen-burr) and did not retract that op-ed.

[Burr sold roughly a million dollars in stock including significant amounts of hotel stock in February]
(https://www.propublica.org/article/senator-dumped-up-to-1-7-million-of-stock-after-reassuring-public-about-coronavirus-preparedness), which is predictable to tank in a pandemic. [Loeffler also sold large amounts of stock \(on the order of a million\), and bought significant shares in 3 technology company stocks](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/politics/senate-stocks-kelly-loeffler-coronavirus/index.html), including Citrix which is a company specializing in remote access technology. Citrix's stock is something that would predictably do well in a pandemic. In short, both Senators are accused of valuing their personal finances over the country's wellbeing. 

[Loeffler has denied wrongdoing](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/loeffler-stock-trades-roil-georgia-special-election-140088). Burr has [also denied insider trading, but did ask for the Senate Ethics committee to review his decision.](https://twitter.com/SenatorBurr/status/1241008837479542786). The timing may be on their side, if Jan 24th was the only briefing then there was a lag of weeks between the briefing and stock sales.

These stock sellings may run afoul of insider trading (via [2012 Stock act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act)). However, [this CNN article (also linked above)](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/politics/senate-stocks-kelly-loeffler-coronavirus/index.html) claims there's no evidence that it does. [This NPR article claims it's virtual impossible to prosecute anyway.
](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/it-illegal-lawmakers-trade-stocks-insider-info-they-learn-job-n1165156)
Both are [receiving heavy criticism for these actions](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1240816305697103874) and [calls for resignation](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1240815356572205056). ]

Another top level comment is arguing that they ""lied"". While you can reasonably argue that there was a lie of omission (an argument I find compelling), and especially so in the case of Burr who did not retract his statement from early February (we don't know exactly how much he was briefed on Jan 24th/prior to his Feb 7th op ed), it is a bit misleading to say ""they lied"" without qualification. 

Note that there are accusations of other senators doing similar things, the accusations against them are not nearly as compelling. All of them were involved in buying/selling stock, but wealthy Americans (like most Senators) do this regularly so the timing alone is not incriminating. For instance, Dianne Feinstein's (Dem-California) husband sold a large volume of stock in a company in January, [but he actually did so at a low point for that stock](https://twitter.com/SenFeinstein/status/1241010796496330752). It's unlikely that this could be considered Insider trading. Another example is Inhofe (Rep-Oklahoma), [who sold stock in paypal which seems like the sort of stock that would do well during a pandemic.](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1240836957355343873)"

Doubtful. Financial Analysts understand securities, derivatives, and bubbles. Analysts have no clue what they're doing with this. There's a fog of war involved; their models don't work. Forecasts are being withdrawn.

Systems are interconnected. Small changes in one place can cause big changes somewhere else. No one knows yet what the effect total effect on economic systems will be, because this has never happened before.

The only thing that will signal an all clear is actually being over already.

It's worth noting that he was also the single no vote in the first week of March against the $8B appropriations bill.

While I don't wish this disease upon anyone, it's somewhat poetic that he is now the lone Senator with the virus.

Wtf? Assume **75%** reduction in contacts, after you *know* you have coronavirus? How many people do you pass on the street in a normal day, riding around on the subway, going to an office...We should expect that isolated cases interact with *nobody*. Interactions should be down by more than 99%.

But even worse, **70% compliance**? Are you fucking shitting me? We're shutting down whole cities here, and we're ready to throw up our hands and say ""meh they probably won't stay home""?

I feel like some people are paranoid when it comes to whale manipulation, of course it's a large element in market forces, but there's tens of thousands of private traders with smaller (and large) stacks that aren't all behaving in a cooperative manner, but instead are subject to the standard market principles that affect both conventional assets of the stock market and crypto. 

&#x200B;

Just because a price move happens in tandem doesn't inherently mean there's some overarching correlation that fundamentally invalidates cryptocurrency as a whole, it's utility, value, merit, or even price. 

There's a logical reason that BTC dropped given world events - and that has to deal with human psychology and economic behavior on a macro level. FUD in society is going to cause FUD in systemic financial appendages of society - which **both** bitcoin and stock are. 

But to be so confident that 'whales' conspired with the sole objective of running an ""anti-correlation bull trap,"" to me, is not following any of the top occam's razor explanations. 

Put another way, lets say futures weren't a thing for the stock market, and we didn't have hourly updates on coronavirus news, all variables were static this afternoon - contrary to the reality: that all those things actually playing a role in the collective awareness of economic and pandemic related matters...BTC was still at a fiercely matched resistance level between 6.4 ish and 5000's, I think some call this a gravity well. 

So if you hypothetically removed all those variables and looked at BTC in isolation, the odds were in my opinion fairly likely we would have seen 6 break this afternoon anyway, as price discovery and bull vs bear battles continued. 

Maybe I'm overlooking something, and I'm by **no means** an expert in TA, market analysis, or finance, beyond being blued to crypto charts since 2015 and having a diverse portfolio - but overall, this sub lately has been saturated with unsubstantiated quick comments without any substance beyond conjecture, or just enough substance to FUD someone who is less informed / newer to the space, into adopting the commenter's POV (often a POV they've adopted due to their fucking up a trade and are salty about it)

I'm not sure how much clearer that could be.  In fact, here's the transcript:

""Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus. They are politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs — you say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good. Not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count the votes in Iowa. No, they can’t. One of my people came up to me and said, “Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.” That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early, we could have had a lot more than that. We’re doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified. We are so unified. The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now. There has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now. Never been a movement. So a statistic that we want to talk about, go ahead. Say USA. It’s okay. USA. So a number that nobody heard of, that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? 35,000, that’s a lot of people. It could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000. They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die. And so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn’t mean we won’t and we are totally prepared. It doesn’t mean we won’t, but think of it. You hear 35 and 40,000 people and we’ve lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode."""

It is for these reasons, last November, after a robust internal process at school sites and in regions, that the UTLA House of Representatives overwhelmingly endorsed Sanders.

2020-03-22,winterdates,Coronavirus,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fnaedd/with_command_and_control_taiwan_excels_in/fl8gei9/,"TAIPEI: As the coronavirus pandemic takes a rapidly increasing toll on the health and well-being of people around the world – as well as the global economy and social fabric more broadly – Taiwan has won widespread recognition for its impressive performance in dealing with the crisis.

Relying on a combination of preparedness, technology, and transparency, Taiwan has managed to limit the number of reported cases and deaths – at numbers far fewer than in neighbouring countries.

A key element in Taiwan’s preparedness was the lessons learned from its devastating experience with the SARS epidemic in 2003, which caused 71 deaths on the island of 23 million people.

Seeing that the initial response to SARS was hampered by the lack of a centralised decision-making body to take charge during a health crisis, Taiwan later that year authorised the creation of a Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) to coordinate across government departments and mobilise necessary resources during future crises.

TAIWAN’S MEASURES TO FIGHT COVID-19

To fight COVID-19, the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen activated the CECC as early as Jan 20, with the Minister of Health and Welfare designated as the commander.

Over the following weeks, the CECC put scores of measures into effect to aid in containing the disease and preventing its spread into the general community. This included screening incoming travellers for fever and implementing a system of rationing face masks to prevent hoarding.

The steps also included mandatory self-quarantine for people who had recently travelled to affected parts of the world, while self-isolation was recommended for those who had come in contact with potentially exposed individuals. The existing neighbourhood warden system facilitated enforcement of the quarantines and helped deliver meals and other assistance to those who needed it.

Border controls were also implemented. Beginning Feb 6, Taiwan started prohibiting entry by anyone who had been in China or Hong Kong during the previous 14 days. 

The restrictions were imposed on more countries and areas as the coronavirus spread, and by Mar 19 the travel ban had been extended to nearly all foreigners without Taiwanese residence certification.

All travellers returning from abroad are now required to undergo two weeks of self-quarantine.

But of concern is the estimated 50,000 undocumented workers from Southeast Asia, many of them serving as caregivers for the elderly and infirm. To overcome their reluctance to come forward when in need of treatment, civic organisations are urging the government to provide amnesty for their illegal immigration status.

USING DATA AND WINNING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE

Also playing an important role in constraining the spread of the virus has been Taiwan’s strong background in information technology. 

Databases belonging to the National Health Insurance Administration, National Immigration Agency, and Customs Administration were integrated, allowing artificial intelligence and big data techniques to be employed to identify those at greatest risk through their travel and medical history.

Hotlines were made available to provide accurate advice for people who fear that they or their loved ones are showing COVID-19 symptoms, and with the help of the police, mobile phone records were used to track the social contacts of those infected with the coronavirus.

Taiwanese citizens, normally sensitive about personal data privacy, seemed to accept the more aggressive policy as necessary for the public good.

In addition, the openness of the government’s communications strategy has been instrumental in maintaining public confidence. Televised daily media briefings by Health Minister Chen Shih-chung in his capacity as CECC chief have had a calming influence.

The public also found it reassuring that the country’s vice president, Chen Chien-jen – a noted Johns Hopkins University-trained epidemiologist – has been part of the policymaking process. As head of the health authority in 2003, he was considered one of the heroes of the SARS incident.

The relative optimism has extended to the international business community in Taiwan, as seen in the results of the 2020 Business Climate Survey of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei. It was conducted between mid-January and mid-February, as the severity of the epidemic was becoming more apparent.

Still, more than 70 per cent of respondents expressed confidence in Taiwan’s prospects for solid economic growth when looking at a three-year timeframe.

INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATION

In China, the delay in taking action and suppression of information about the COVID-19 crisis only seemed to exacerbate the situation by eroding public trust. In contrast, Taiwan’s transparency in responding to the crisis paid off.
When reports of the virulent “Wuhan pneumonia” first emerged last December, it was expected that the immense volume of travel and trade with China would present Taiwan with a perhaps insurmountable hurdle in controlling the contagion.

In fact, Taiwan’s awareness of developments in China made it conscious quite early of the potential seriousness of the virus and to take action more quickly than did others in the region. 

As early as the beginning of December, Taiwanese health officers started boarding flights arriving from Wuhan to check passengers for symptoms before they could leave the plane.

Throughout this and other public health crises, Taiwan has had to manage without any direct communication channel with the World Health Organization. Besides public information, it depends on WHO notices relayed to Taiwan by sympathetic governments and NGOs.

But that line of communication is inadequate, and it ignores the contribution to world health that Taiwan could make as a WHO member or even as an observer at the annual World Health Assembly. 

Given its outstanding medical researchers and highly respected national healthcare system, Taiwan is well-positioned to play a significant part in promoting public health internationally, especially at times of emergency such as now.

When people’s lives are at risk, political differences should not be allowed to present a barrier."

Guide, Guard, and Groom,"" Green reportedly says in the letter. ""We serve a God who will Guide us through this storm, who will Guard us as we travel to places never seen before, and who, as a result of this experience, will Groom us to be better than we could have ever thought possible before now."" 

Green wrote that while the future remains unclear, the company can ""rest in knowing that God is in control,"" adding that the company may have to ""tighten our belts"" moving forward. 

""While we do not know for certain what the future holds, or how long this disruption will last, we can all rest in knowing that God is in control,"" he wrote. ""The Company's leaders are doing all they can to balance the need to keep the Company strong and the need of employees. To help ensure our Company remains strong and prepared to once again when this passes, we may all have to 'tighten our belts' over the near future.'""


Though the company wrote in a note on its website that if a worker exhibits symptoms it ""will send that employee for medical care to self-isolate at home,"" it did not state if they will be eligible for paid sick leave. According to the company's 2017 benefits summary guide, its most recently available public document on benefits, only salaried employees are eligible for paid sick leave, leaving hourly workers without protection in the face of the coronavirus. 

Green's note was widely lambasted on Twitter, as several users took to the platform to call out the company for the alleged policies, including writer and editor Parker Molloy who dubbed Hobby Lobby one of ""the most deceptively evil companies on the planet."" 

The Twitter furor comes on the heels of a recent investigation that discovered pieces of the Dead Sea Scrolls featured at the Museum of the Bible – an organization that is majority funded by Hobby Lobby and the Green family — were fake. In 2018, the museum and Hobby Lobby also found itself at the center of controversy for smuggling 4,000 ancient artifacts from Iraq without authorization.

1. Insider trading laws do not apply. Those apply to people who have specific information about specific companies, and not to a general economic panic.

3. Be cautious of over-hyped reporting. For example, articles claimed Senators sold stock ""after"" receiving a non-public briefing. But [that briefing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/20/richard-burrs-kelly-loefflers-suspiciously-well-timed-stock-trades-during-coronavirus-examined/)  was January 24, and one Senator sold stock 3 weeks later on 13 February. Coronavirus news changes so quickly that much more was   publicly known by then. Another Senator started selling stock the same   day as the briefing, which seems more suspicious.
4. Many members of Congress claim their assets are managed by others and they had nothing to do with the decisions to sell.

No matter if you have had it or not, everyone everywhere should be staying home unless you are actually legally compelled by the government to work.

Use a headset with a microphone if needed. 

The idea might kinda work. However, I believe the newest and best plans are to separate Coronavirus patients from non-coronavirus patients, and use the retired staff with only the non-coronavirus patients. 

Much of the doctor's skill is in the wide breadth of knowledge; the students won't need nearly as much training to work with most coronavirus-only patients. And hopefully there are enough experienced-but-not-old doctors to handle the Coronavirus patients with complications, as well as patients that are incoming for a normal reason (broken leg, car crash, ate a Tide pod, etc) who also happen to by asymptomatic with coronavirus - though these guys will require rapid tests to ensure they are put into the correct group. 

I expect medical and nursing students to be pulled into hospitals a year or two earlier than normal. Hopefully - hopefully - the instructors are revising courses to focus on the most relevant subjects to teach the necessary info ASAP.

They can handle it, they are grad students. We've drafted fresh highschool graduates into wars by the thousands. I'd much rather be pulled into this than into a war.

The hard part may be putting them back into school afterwards, to finish the studies and classes that they need to finish in order to have all the knowledge they need to be a doctor with non-pandemic patients."

Unfortunately that’s unpaid leave. But you should apply ASAP,  all HR and ask for paperwork.

The Families first Act would not cover you at this time, as you work for a company with more than 500 employees (although this could be changing as we speak with the stimulus package being negotiated in Congress right now).

If coverage under the family first act is extended to employers of more than 500 people it would provide 2 weeks of pay at 2/3 your normal pay to care for another individual (there is an upper pay limit on this, but I don’t recall what it is off the top of my head)"

People preparing food may be asymptomatic carriers and won't know it. They may not fully understand the risk. A poorly contained sneeze might be all it takes.

According to [""First data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus compiled by members of WHO laboratory network""](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/survival_2003_05_04/en/) from 2003 (which I've seen referenced in several articles regarding the current SARS-CoV-2 strain):

""Heat at 56°C [132.8°F] kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 min (quick reduction).""

Unsurprisingly, 135°F is a common minimum temperature recommended for food preparation to ensure safety ([USDA recommends 145-165°F depending on the type of food](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/safe-minimum-internal-temperature-chart/ct_index)), and that's not a coincidence. 

If you order food delivery and question the safety of the food, you can always reheat the food to at least 135°F (145-165°F if you want to be extra safe) and keep it at that temp or higher for a several minutes to kill any pathogens. Use a food thermometer in the center of the thickest part of the food when checking temperatures. I'd aim for food that holds up well to reheating (funny enough, Chinese food works great despite some people attempting to demonize the country with the ""Chinese virus"" label).

Treat the packaging as contaminated and minimize contact between it and other surfaces, safely discard the packaging, wash your hands once you place the food in whatever you're reheating it in, and disinfect surfaces that the packaging or your contaminated hands touched."

League bosses will meet with government officials to see if it’s possible to keep playing games despite new restrictions on interstate travel putting a stop to the AFL on Sunday.

Here’s the latest:

#HEARTBROKEN EDDIE’S MESSAGE TO NRL

A heartbroken Eddie McGuire says he has no issues with the NRL pushing ahead with its season even after the AFL was forced to hit pause on its campaign because of the coronavirus outbreak.

AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan confirmed on Sunday the competition would be suspended for at least two months as the government announced strict new measures to try and slow the spread of the virus.

Collingwood president McGuire was brought onto an emergency committee formed to deal with the challenges facing footy because of the global pandemic and was involved in the meetings which led to the season being put on ice, which he said on Channel 9’s Today was “absolutely heartbreaking”.

Asked about the NRL’s decision to play on, McGuire said he had no problem with the rival code trying to stay afloat.

“It’s a different competition,” McGuire said. “They only play in … three states but with one team in Melbourne, whereas the AFL, once the borders closed in South Australia and Western Australia, well it became self-evident that we couldn’t go on with it.

“The NRL – good luck to them for having the best go they possibly can. I don’t think it’s time to be nitpicking on anyone else. They’ve been making the decisions with the information they have in front of them.”

#SPLIT IN THE RANKS

South Sydney CEO Blake Solly has been removed from a committee set up to deal with the financial challenges facing the NRL, The Daily Telegraph reports.

The Telegraph reports Solly was told by head office his services were no longer required despite being one of the sharpest operators in rugby league.

Some have speculated Solly is a candidate to one day replace Todd Greenberg as NRL CEO, and Melbourne Storm chairman Bart Campbell says clubs deserve answers about why the Rabbitohs boss was cast aside.

""All we're looking for is transparency and fairness,"" Campbell said. ""It won't help us to achieve that by not having Blake in there. I'd like the NRL to explain why he's not there to help work through the many challenges.""

#GREENBERG GETTING GOVERNMENT ADVICE TODAY

NRL CEO Todd Greenberg says the NRL will try and push on with its season, even as he acknowledged that will become more difficult as concern about coronavirus increases.

On Sunday, Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) Chairman Peter V’landys confirmed the league would continue and Greenberg says the NRL won’t give up hope on putting games on for as long as possible.

There was widespread disbelief in Australia that rugby league was still going ahead as Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the closure of all pubs, clubs and entertainment venues. Speaking to Triple M Sydney’s Lawrence Mooney & Jess Eva this morning, Greenberg spoke about the uncertainty the code is facing as it balances the financial incentive for playing with “community standards” about combating coronavirus.

“I think that in community standards the virus is going to continue to get more difficult to combat,” Greenberg said.

“What that means for us I’m not sure … what I said last week still stands, 2020 won’t be a straight line. We are going to have some bumps in the road and I think we are going to get stopped occasionally. But … we are going to try to keep the games going.”

The AFL might have put its season on hold but Greenberg says the NRL has been encouraged by different levels of government to continue as long as it is safe to do so, and added it was important to try and push ahead to give people some semblance of normality during this crisis.

“We have been encouraged by both governments to keep going,” Greenberg said.

“In times of great difficulty, particularly for communities, one of the last pieces that they can hold onto is live sport and having some interaction over the weekend, and there’s not much left, to be frank, in this point in time.

“So if we can keep our game alive then I think that has a variety of positives in it. But we are obviously realists.

“We are going to keep trying, we haven’t given up hope yet.

“Our circumstances are a little different to the AFL, although in saying that we are going to take advice today from both federal and state government, and obviously our health experts. And if we can continue to play which is what our desire has been all along, then we will continue to do so.”"

Granted, the Coronavirus is worrying everybody at the moment, but the difference is, we are all in it together, so you're not just facing your own problems alone. 

There are hundreds of things you can do, but I would suggest doing some reading about glitches, about approaches to reality, about mystical matters.

Evidence is starting to emerge that temperature and humidity do make a difference in the ability of the virus to infect large numbers. That should give health services hope for some respite as summer spreads across northern temperate regions, aiding the ability to plan for renewed outbreaks once winter rolls around.

There’s been suggestive evidence on this front for some time. Iran, which accounts for about 90 percent of coronavirus cases in the Middle East, is unique in the region for mostly sitting on a plateau where winter conditions resemble those of more northerly countries. At the same time, some Southeast Asian nations with close business and tourism links to China have seen surprisingly few cases, even if you assume their less developed public health systems are missing infections. Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines have each seen fewer cases than Estonia, Slovenia or Iceland, despite a combined population more than 100 times as large.

This is for the one person who wanted me to post an update, haha.

So after I was [exposed to my positive-testing cousin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjla5p/comment/fko255j), I was instructed to stay in single-room quarantine, besides the guest bathroom and occasionally the backyard, for 14 days. (I live with four housemates.) I got three meals taken up to me and did a lot of organizing and Skyping. I'm an extrovert, so it was frankly torture, and it ended up not even being a week.

On the third day I had body aches, a low fever, and my asthma had worsened, so I called my PCP and they prescribed a test for me. I took it from my car via a drive-through testing facility at my local hospital and it was highly unpleasant. They said I wouldn't get the results for 5-7 days, but after two days, on a call with the DOH about whether our cat could hang out with me, they revealed my test had come back negative. SWEET FREEDOM.

Honestly I'm really lucky b/c my state (NY) now has no tests left. I feel kind of guilty one was wasted on me, but I only did what they told me to. :(

Anyway, I've now gone out with gloves and mask (lucky enough to have a 95n in my disaster kit) and stocked up enough food for three months and water for three weeks (and lots of booze). Trying to get prescription meds but it's tough. They're closing all ""non-essential"" businesses tonight and I have no idea what will change in the next day, let alone the next week. Certainly taking this shit seriously now.

Oh, and I got a Nintendo Switch.

Thanks to everyone who helped me out and gave me advice! Stay well."

Not literally me in the photo, but I went to Bourbon Street last Saturday (the 14th) as a tourist. When I made the decision to go out, I really, honestly did not think it was a big deal. There were only a few cases in Louisiana and I thought it would be better to go out and spend my money and support your local economy than to go home. Yes, I was being an idiot but I really did not know whom to believe, and this was well before shelter in place orders were in effect anywhere in the US. I scanned the r/asknola sub for advice and opinions were split as to whether I should go have fun or go home early. I scanned this sub and saw people's stories of how they were being financially affected by the low tourism. I asked my friends and family and Google for advice. People at the hotel gave me advice on where to go on Bourbon street, and everyone at the hotel restaurant and bar thought there was little risk to going out/that the disease was being blown out of proportion by the news media. I can't tell you how many people - locals, tourists, hotel and bar staff - compared it to the flu, saying coronavirus really wasn't a big deal.


I really thought about it, and thought going out was the better choice.

 Hi all. I completely 100% support measures we're taking to control this horrible virus. However I would like to see complete explanation of how are we exactly planning to extinct this virus. Example: we're now in complete lockdown mostly worldwide (or will be) and then virus number decreases almost to zero. Then , Businesses slowly open, people start going into streets and everything is nice again. However, let's say we still have only 1 person who is positive (which we don't know about it and can't know about 100% of population for sure).

Here's a daily overview of the symptoms so far. 

Day 1: Just dry cough every 20-40 mins.

Day 2: after having breakfast I started to feel very tired and wanted to lay down. Within an hour I had a very bad fever, body ache, joints ache, headache, fatigue and drowsiness.

Day 3: same as day 2 but fever was less severe but still bad. 

Day 4: same as day 3. By end of day 4 I could feel the fever is almost gone and I could actually leave the bed.

Day 5: no more fever, everything else I mentioned on day 2 above persisted but less severe. I have also noticed I have lost sense of taste and smell completely. Cough was still in the same rhythm, 2 dry coughs every 20-40 mins. I have also noticed I don't cough when I'm lying down on my back.

Day 6: the mentioned symptoms gradually disappearing.

Day 7: no longer feel body aches of any sort, no longer feel drowsy but I could feel my cough were slightly deeper, same rythym though.

Day 8: started to feel chest is more tight, and coughs are slightly more frequent and deeper than before.

I am hoping this won't develop into pneumonia. 
I still haven't regain my sense of taste/smell back. 

I found this article a bit useful as well https://www.businessinsider.com/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-symptoms-day-by-day-2020-3?r=US&IR=T

Please be aware that symptoms and their development varies a lot from one person. To the other, my gf F27 caught it off me and her symptoms were much milder compared to me, and she almost had no cough at all. She is no fully recovered from what she can tell, it took 4/5 days for her.

i've also dealt with insurance workers who have compassionately helped me reduce the cost of my care when i was injured. how to ask a (greedy, BMW-driving) MD to code something differently so it costs less. how to dispute a bill from a hospital. insurance is a service and has helped lots of people get medical treatment they elsewise couldn't afford. it's only bc our healthcare has gotten so advanced (and therefore expensive) that now it might make sense to socialize it. but the theory of insurance (home, car, not just HC) is there to provide a safety net and make everyone in society's life better

i'll tell you who doesn't have compassion or work hard: marketing firms! you think anyone's life has ever been made better by an advertisement?! does it take years in the lab and studying hard subjects like medicinal chemistry to sit in meetings or at your desk watching youtube half the time, once in a while thinking 30 seconds about a clever name or twitter post?"

there's a lot of people in this city talking about symptoms (cough, can't breathe)

.... we **know**, **from other sources** that XX people from this city go to this **other city** every month because we looked a plane tickets historically...  or we KNOW.. based on cell data, how many people took cars/trains and moved to another place.

....social media in the OTHER city starts using the same words as the first city.

reasonable to assume it spread.

how many times do people say ""cough"" in city 2.. on day one?

how many **MORE** times do that say it each day?

>How can they warn people if it is anonymous?

maybe you might want to give the hospitals a heads up.

we are hearing 15% more ""symptom chatter"" than we were yesterday.

add a little GPS (foursquare, yelp, grubhub.. all know where you are)

and now you can warn at neighborhood level.

My take home was that delivery seems by far the safest option, due to more likelihood of transmitting the virus via air droplets than by surface touching. Transmission by ingesting is super unlikely.

Cooking your own meals could require more trips to the grocery store, which is higher risk.

The safest option, by my understanding, seems like delivery. I'm having delivery people leave on my doorstep so we don't have to interact. Could improve safety a little bit by transferring from the takeout container to your own dishware.

DALLAS COUNTY

AMENDED ORDER OF COUNTY JUDGE CLAY JENKINS  
Stay Home Stay Safe  
DATE AMENDED ORDER ISSUED: March 22, 2020  


WHEREAS, pursuant to Texas Government Code Section 418.108, Dallas County Judge Clay
Jenkins issued a Declaration of Local Disaster for Public Health Emergency on March 12, 2020,
due to a novel coronavirus now designated SARS-CoV2 which causes the disease COVID-19;
and,   
WHEREAS, on March 12, 2020, Judge Jenkins issued an Order in furtherance of his authority to
protect the safety and welfare of the public by slowing the spread of the virus; and,     
WHEREAS, the on-going evaluation of circumstances related to the virus and the updated
recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and the Texas Department of State Health
Services warrant the March 12, 2020 Order of County Judge Clay Jenkins be amended;  
WHEREAS, on March 16, 2020, President Trump acknowledged the gravity of the COVID-19
pandemic, releasing strict new guidelines to limit people’s interactions, including that Americans
should avoid groups of more than 10 people;    
WHEREAS, on March 19, 2020, the Dallas County Commissioners Court issued an Order of
Continuance of Declaration of Local Disaster for Public Health Emergency that affirmed the
activation of the Dallas County Emergency Management Plan and extends the Declaration of Local
Disaster until 11:59 p.m. on April 3, 2020, unless rescinded by order of the Commissioners Court.  

THEREFORE, the March 12, 2020, Order of County Judge Clay Jenkins is hereby AMENDED
as follows:  

Summary: The virus that causes 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is easily transmitted
through person to person contact, especially in group settings, and it is essential that the spread of
the virus be slowed to protect the ability of public and private health care providers to handle the
influx of new patients and safeguard public health and safety. Because of the risk of the rapid
spread of the virus, and the need to protect the most vulnerable members of the community, this
Order requires all individuals anywhere in Dallas County to shelter in place – that is, stay at home
– except for certain essential activities and work to provide essential business and government
services or perform essential public infrastructure construction, including housing. This Order
takes effect at 11:59 p.m. on March 23, 2020 and will continue through 11:59 p.m. on April 3,
2020, subject to the limited exceptions and under the terms and conditions more particularly set
forth below.

UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF TEXAS GOVERNMENT CODE
SECTION 418.108, DALLAS COUNTY JUDGE CLAY JENKINS ORDERS:

1. Effective as of 11:59 p.m. on March 23, 2020, and continuing until 11:59 p.m. on April 3,
2020:  
(a) All individuals currently living within Dallas County are ordered to shelter at
their place of residence. For the purposes of this Order, residences include
hotels, motels, shared rentals, and similar facilities. To the extent individuals
are using shared or outdoor spaces, they must at all times as reasonably as
possible maintain social distancing of at least six feet from any other person
when they are outside their residence. All persons may leave their residences
only for Essential Activities, or to provide or perform Essential Governmental
Functions, or to operate Essential Businesses, all as defined in Section 2.  
(b) All businesses operating within Dallas County, except Essential Businesses as
defined in below in Section 2, are required to cease all activities at facilities
located within the County. For clarity, businesses may continue operations
consisting exclusively of employees or contractors performing activities at their
own residences (i.e. working from home). To the greatest extent possible, all
Essential Businesses shall comply with the Social Distancing Guidelines
attached, including maintaining six foot social distancing for both employees
and the general public.  
(c) All public or private gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a
single household or living unit are prohibited, except as otherwise provided
herein. Nothing in this Order prohibits the gathering of members of a household
or living unit.  
(d) Restaurants with or without drive-in or drive-through services and
microbreweries, micro-distilleries, or wineries may only provide take out, delivery, or
drive-through services as allowed by law.  
(e) Religious and worship services may only be provided by video and
teleconference. Religious institutions must limit in-person staff to ten (10) people or less
when preparing for or conducting video or teleconference services, and all individuals must
follow the Social Distancing Guidelines including the six foot social distancing.  
(f) All elective medical, surgical, and dental procedures are prohibited anywhere in
Dallas County. Hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, dental offices, and other medical
facilities are directed to identify procedures that are deemed ""elective"" by assessing which
procedures can be postponed or cancelled based on patient risk considering the emergency
need for redirection of resources to COVID-19 response.

Whatever cocktail of medicines Biden recieved for that televised debate won't have the same effect again, because his brain just keeps fading. Hence why there may never be another public appearance for Joe Biden. He can't say anything about the coronavirus because he doesn't know what it is or what impact a global pandemic has.

The Australian Consumer Law prohibits businesses from taking payments for services when there are reasonable grounds to believe the services won’t be supplied. This applies whether or not your contract allows you to suspend payments. If payments have been deducted then you should contact your gym to have the payments refunded.

The CDC – hamstrung by Trump who limited what they were allowed do – restricted who could get tested for the novel coronavirus. Because the CDC reported numbers only for people who were physically ill already, and nobody else (at first), the epidemic did not look like one. 

It was and is an epidemic here (and a pandemic globally), but we don't have a true picture of how many people are actually infected. The whole scheme of manipulating the testing masked the reality of the epidemic, for whatever reason. (It's speculated that politics played a role.)

This numerical deception made the epidemic worse, and the US is basically on the same path of hospital saturation and death as Italy, but 12 days behind. That is, unless something very significant occurs — widespread mask use, a good drug treatment coming out, or the magical appearance of 5000+ extra ventilators. If you haven't been watching Italy, well, read up a bit. No funerals; no relatives allowed to be present when someone is dying; rationing who gets a ventilator. . . We must use their ill fate as an example of what not to do. (Other countries like the UK and Germany are having issues similar to Italy, but for different reasons.)

The testing void is now being filled by States, universities, private labs, and others. At least, they're trying to. We will only know how Covid-19 spread like it did in hindsight, which will not help us right now. Only history books will tell. In fact, several States' Governors have said that all testing should halt because the pandemic is past the stage of containment, and it's now a waste of resources to test.

Because we don't know the true infection rate, we cannot get a clear handle on the true mortality rate. Now, we will never truly know, and will have to rely on estimates by epidemiologists after they pore through all of the numbers from individual testing labs. That will take a long time. We need to have that info right now, but don't and won't.

Put simply, the policy was ""Don't look and it will go away,"" which plagues don't do. The policy made the US epidemic much worse. It's a national tragedy that could have easily been avoided by widespread early testing."

>We also don't even know how it started for sure. While it's likely it was originally in bats, coronavirus strains there tend to be intestinal instead of the respiratory type we're seeing now. It's possible that pangolins could be involved, but we just don't know

Even if this is true, which I'm doubtful, it's most likely originated in china, there is a reason these viruses keep appearing in china, there are favorable conditions for mutation across species.

2020-03-22,Trumpologist,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fn6eyn/hydroxychloroquine_is_helping_our_coronavirus/fl7seb3/,"A flash of potential good news from the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic: A treatment is showing promise. Doctors in France, South Korea and the U.S. are using an antimalarial drug known as hydroxychloroquine with success. We are physicians treating patients with Covid-19, and the therapy appears to be making a difference. It isn’t a silver bullet, but if deployed quickly and strategically the drug could potentially help bend the pandemic’s “hockey stick” curve.

Hydroxychloroquine is a common generic drug used to treat lupus, arthritis and malaria. The medication, whose brand name is Plaquenil, is relatively safe, with the main side effect being stomach irritation, though it can cause echocardiogram and vision changes. In 2005, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study showed that chloroquine, an analogue, could block a virus from penetrating a cell if administered before exposure. If tissue had already been infected, the drug inhibited the virus.

On March 9 a team of researchers in China published results showing hydroxychloroquine was effective against the 2019 coronavirus in a test tube. The authors suggested a five-day, 12-pill treatment for Covid-19: two 200-milligram tablets twice a day on the first day followed by one tablet twice a day for four more days.

A more recent French study used the drug in combination with azithromycin. Most Americans know azithromycin as the brand name Zithromax Z-Pak, prescribed for upper respiratory infections. The Z-Pak alone doesn’t appear to help fight Covid-19, and the findings of combination treatment are preliminary.

But researchers in France treated a small number of patients with both hydroxychloroquine and a Z-Pak, and 100% of them were cured by day six of treatment. Compare that with 57.1% of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone, and 12.5% of patients who received neither.


What’s more, most patients cleared the virus in three to six days rather than the 20 days observed in China. That reduces the time a patient can spread the virus to others. One lesson that should inform the U.S. approach: Use this treatment cocktail early, and don’t wait until a patient is on a ventilator in the intensive-care unit.

A couple of careful studies of hydroxychloroquine are in progress, but the results may take weeks or longer. Infectious-disease experts are already using hydroxychloroquine clinically with some success. With our colleague Dr. Joe Brewer in Kansas City, Mo., we are using hydroxychloroquine in two ways: to treat patients and as prophylaxis to protect health-care workers from infection.

We had been using the protocol outlined in the research from China, but we’ve switched to the combination prescribed in the French study. Our patients appear to be showing fewer symptoms.

Our experience suggests that hydroxychloroquine, with or without a Z-Pak, should be a first-line treatment. Unfortunately, there is already a shortage of hydroxychloroquine. The federal government should immediately contract with generic manufacturers to ramp up production. Any stockpiles should be released.

As a matter of clinical practice, hydroxychloroquine should be given early to patients who test positive, and perhaps if Covid-19 is presumed—in the case of ill household contacts, for instance. It may be especially useful to treat mild cases and young patients, which would significantly decrease viral transmission and, as they say, “flatten the curve.”

Emergency rooms run the risk of one patient exposing a dozen nurses and doctors. Instead of exposed health workers getting placed on 14-day quarantine, they could receive hydroxychloroquine for five days, then test for the virus. That would allow health-care workers to return to work sooner if they test negative.

President Trump touted hydroxychloroquine in his Thursday press conference as a potential treatment, which is a welcome move. And this isn’t only about treatment. Rapid and strategic use of these drugs could help arrest the spread of the disease.

We have decades of experience in treating infectious diseases and dealing with epidemics, and we believe in safety and efficacy. We don’t want to peddle false hope; we have seen promising drugs turn out to be duds.

But the public expects an answer, and we don’t have the luxury of time. We have a drug with an excellent safety profile but limited clinical outcomes—and no better alternatives until long after this disaster peaks. We can use this treatment to help save lives and prevent others from becoming infected. Or we can wait several weeks and risk discovering we didn’t do everything we could to end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

>Wildlife markets represent a dangerous source of possible new infections that could undermine the prevention of SARS (figure). Game foods are believed to “enhance the vitality of the body,” and as Cantonese people consume a substantial amount of game as a tonic in cold weather, the wildlife markets in Guangzhou thrive in winter. Many markets are poorly managed and insanitary, so cross infection, interspecies transmission, amplification, genetic convergence, and mixing of coronavirus may be taking place. Animal traders standing in close proximity to these infected animals may be affected, as may the food processors who slaughter infected animals in restaurant kitchens, causing SARS-CoV to spread from wildlife to humans—after which it may spread from human to human, principally by drop-let transmission. **It is too early to conclude that the SARS threat is over. If no action is taken to control wildlife markets, the SARS-CoV organism may develop into an epidemic strain.**

The [CDC states](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html#crisis-capacity) ""In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.

And they have the sidekick, who is usually portrayed with a certain image (the geek, the nerd) and the character’s not even treated in a way that romantic relationships are a concern for him. He’s just there to cheer on the lead romance. It does kinda send a message about how looks are valued by society. Imo

Italy is an outlier. They, as a nation, smoke heavily. They are older. They leave in family homes with loads of people a lot more.

China has the pollution to cope with.

Other countries have lower death rates, and let's not forget, the reported death rates include people that would have died anyway. If a 80 year old gets pneumonia and is hospitalised and would normally die from it, but picks up coronavirus while in hospital and dies anyway, is that a coronavirus death?

The death rates for people aged 20-30, who don't smoke, don't have underlying conditions and have no other contributing factor are so small, it's probably not even able to be calculated.

""In fact, the research team found that the SARS-CoV-2 structure in general is quite different from what humans would have likely concocted. If a human had wanted to create a viral weapon, he or she would have started with the structure of a virus that’s already known to cause illness in people. Naturally, if you want to make a weapon, you may want to start with something like a grenade launcher rather than a smoothie maker, not that the virus looks like either. Instead, the structure of SARS-CoV2 is quite similar to those of viruses known to infect bats and pangolins. ""

"" The emergence of human coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, is thought to be driven by the spillover of bat-adapted CoVs into an intermediate host. For SARS-CoV, this intermediate host is believed to be palm civets, while camels play that role for MERS-CoV. The existence and identity of an intermediate host for the 2019-nCoV has yet to be determined. Direct transmission of CoVs from bats to people is also theoretically possible. ""

"" Study co-author Kristian Andersen, associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research, said in a statement: ""By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes.""

Josie Golding, epidemics lead at UK-based research charity the Wellcome Trust, said in a statement the conclusion ends ""any speculation about deliberate genetic engineering.""

The way the virus' spike proteins interact with a part of human cells called ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection that enables it to bind optimally, the authors wrote. The backbone of SARS-CoV-2 was also different enough to other known viruses for the team to conclude that it wasn't manmade.

""This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation,"" they wrote.

Instead, the team hypothesizes SARS-CoV-2 emerged from natural selection in either animals or humans. Bats are a potential host for the virus SARS-CoV-2 mutated from, as are Malayan pangolins, which are illegally important to Guangdong province. The spike proteins of coronaviruses in both these animals have similarities with those of SARS-CoV-2, the team found. """

I think it's a really interesting perspective on what a shut down might look like in Australia.

Presently, we might have tepid support for a shutdown because there's a kind of communal anxiety, but I suspect that might change after a few weeks when fears become immediate & personal, like being able to afford food & rent.

/u/TechIBD's post:

---
i will give you guys an idea what extent the Chinese went with their lock-down, especially in Wuhan, to successfully contain this virus:

  - Each community would have its own whatsapp group ( wechat), every member of that group need to report body temperature taken daily ( this is for the whole country). Any symptoms at all need to be reported. For any unit that has ppl tested positive, they would have those giant yellow biohazard tapep across that unit door, like in the movies, and they would announce in the whatsapp group and alert everyone.
  - clearly all public space, transportation is shut. City to city border will be blocked so no one is allowed to travel at all.
  - For apartment building with multiple entrance point, all others except the main one will be sealed shut. There is at least one patrolman guarding each apartment. Anyone going in and out need to show their paper/permit on why they need to head out, the reason for this to not only to contain the viruse, but also deter looting, stealing as all business are shut and left unguarded.
  - You basically can't drive unless it's for some serious grocery haul. Some apartment just shut their garage door during the entire lock-down.
  - For any person taking a stroll randomly, or go on the street without permit, large fine, even arrest. If you run you get tazed ( bcs they think you might be out looting )
  - For most cities the entrance to highway is blocked, you can't get out the city at all unless you walk the whole way, provided you don't get stop mid-way.
  - For anyone that's suspected carrying the disease ( I.E leaving wuhan before the city shutdown ) they will track you down and everyone you been in contact with on your way, mandatory quarantine.
  - And finally, people just take this incredibly seriously, family would not meet one another during the lock-down, it's not unusual for family member all staying at separate hotel rooms so they don't cross infect one another if one of their test come back positive.
  - Clearly some of these are quite drastic, but just keep in mind, the mentality in the society is that people are in this together, not brewing rebellion. So even measures are kind of over-the-top, but the patrolman, police enforcing it, do it with genuine care for the community. Ppl have a strong belief that they can get out of these together and everyone is doing their part, this is important as i see some citizens' behavior in other countries' current lock-down can only be described as irresponsible

For treatment:

  - They built a tons of make-shift containment center, so for anyone that's mildly sick, you get put in there and loaded up on antiviral drugs. one nurse can take care of up to 50 patients so it saves hospital beds for ppl who need more urgent care.
  - They also built a couple hospitals but only in Wuhan as the city's healthcare system collapsed.
  - Bcs rest of the country was not as heavily affected, there were something like 300K healthcare workers sent to Wuhan later on to help out. that's 300K nurse and doctors, most went voluntarily, which is kind of nuts as that is more than the number of the patients, but then again, china quarantine anyone that's being suspected carrying the virus in those containment center, and most test end up negative. It's quite a feat none of those 300K are infected, 0. It helps they are all in full hazmat suit all the time. ( edit, by 0% i meant for the 300K sent to wuhan when wuhan's own healthercare system collapsed, the doctors/nurses indigenous to wuhan seen 30% infection rate, and some hospital at the early stage would have their entire staff team infected bcs they are not wearing masks and etc, that was a big problem as more patients are coming in and fewer staff available, doctors were literally going non stop without sleep for full week ended up broken down, staffs are heavy on xanax, as hundreds of death pile up )
  - and then clearly medical supplies were being made countrywide, in a couple wks they made billions of face masks.

Conclusion:

Wuhan certainly didn't beat this epidemics by just its own resource, the entire china helped, and even to this point, whilst the rest of the country has started to restore economic activity bit by bit, wuhan is till under strict lock-down. No park or any sort of business is open. No public transportation, things will likely remain the same till early April.

So you could see what measures have been put in place and it start to make sense why the mortality and R0 is substantially higher in almost anywhere else. Now i have been living in north america for almost a decade and have lived in Europe and Australia before, the few challenges i see with implementing some of the measures in western countries are:

  - ppl would likely not willing to share their travel history, and even if they do, travel history and contact history are private information thus wouldn't be openly shared with the neighborhood. So it's impossible to know if your neighborhood is safe or has the virus has been transmitting inside.
  - ppl would argue total lock-down is violation of their freedom, human rights and etc for its own merit so a true real Marshall law style lock-down is likely not on the table. China implement a very stringent lock-down so after one month they would see 0 new case and people can get back to their life. A half-ass lockdown wouldn't stop transmitting, it would just slow it, so it will take almost forever to see 0 new cases and that defeats the whole purpose of the lock down. If there is still active undetected cases out there then soon as ppl get back to their normal life the outbreak would worsen instantly. i don't know why this is hard to understand. You need a true 0 new cases for the lockdown to make sense. Anything less than that it's a waste of time and resource.
  - Media has been downplaying the danger, or just use China's number to model their projection but totally disregard the measures that were put in place
  - Also important to know that the Chinese manage to identify every single person carrying the virus, even those one show very little symptoms, and the mortality rate is based on that.
  - The mortality rate for flu is at 0.1% is because most of the cases are simply not detected, had you detect all the flu cases the real mortality rate is likely 1 in a hundred thousands or something like along that line. That's also the problem with much higher mortality rate in Italy, and soon in rest of EU plus US, which is there are not enough ppl being tested, if you are only testing the ones that are already in the hospital, then you are really just testing the 20% that are in a condition that need to be hospitalized ,and then of course the mortality rate among those group would be substantially higher. Remember for 100 person tested positive, 20 will need hospitalization, and 3 will need intensive care. However what's happening right now is you are only testing that 20 person, so you will be looking at mortality rate of about 3/20 which would be around 15%, and i think we will likely see that as mortality rate in Italy keep climbing higher.
  - Finally, is that Wuhan has the entire china behind supporting it, which is world second largest economy with the largest manufacturing power and plenty of medical personnel reserve, countries like Italy don't have that support system, when things start to collapse they can't reply on backup for help. So the best is to be as prepared as possible bcs everyone got their hands full if your healthcare system collapse that's pretty much game over.

The sooner the world start to learn and realize this, the sooner we can have this thing under control. Good luck everyone and stay safe."

I was told unless I have a fever of 100.4 or higher AND respiratory issues I would most likely be sent home while they triage people who cannot combat the symptoms at home. They told me to stay home unless I can no longer deal with it myself. I just wanted a yes or no so I could possibly return to work since we are essentially. If we get a shelter in place then I could work from home, but not before that.

I have respectful sign on my front lawn asking people to keep their dogs off of my lawn (actually, it says ""Not your dog's bathroom"").  The regulars have always been respectful for the most part.  There are couple that don't, but most do.  Since this started, however, I have dogs on my lawn all of the time.  I just got a nice video of some little yellow piece of shit squatting and pissing in the middle of my grass.  I'll have to go out there with a watering can and dilute it, or every other one of the dumb shits will be doing it shortly.

The coronavirus isn't the only thing spreading.  A plague of terrible dog owners is accompanying it.

If I were on Nextdoor any more, I guarantee you that there'd be complaints about all of the off-leash dogs and all of the idiots walking their dogs on people's lawns.

Stay At Home Order Frequently Asked Questions

March 22, 2020 | COVID-19

Stay At Home Order Frequently Asked Questions

On Sunday, March 22th, under the direction of Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton, M.D., MPH issued a director’s order to require all Ohioans to stay in their homes to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 beginning at 11:59 p.m. EDT on Monday, March 23, 2020 until 11:59 p.m. on April 6, 2020. This order prohibits holding gatherings of any size and closes all nonessential businesses. It does NOT prohibit essential activities like going to the grocery store, receiving medical care, or taking your pet for a walk. Residents can return home from out of state and can leave the state.

For more information on what this order means for you, please see below.

​Frequently Asked Questions

When does the order take effect?

The order will take effect at 11:59 p.m. EDT on Monday, March 23rd
 

Where does the Stay at Home order apply?

The director’s order includes the entire state. Unless you work for an essential business or are doing an essential activity, you should stay home. Work from home is permitted and encouraged where possible.

Is this mandatory or just guidance?

This order is mandatory. To help prevent the further spread of COVID-19 in Ohio and protect our friends, neighbors, and vulnerable populations, please stay home.

Will the Ohio National Guard be enforcing this order?

No. The Ohio National Guard will not be enforcing this order.

I work in an essential service. How will the police know I'm allowed to be outside my house?

Law enforcement officials will not stop residents who are on their way to or from work or who are out for necessities like going to the pharmacy or getting groceries, or just taking a walk. People gathering in any size group may be asked to physically distance themselves or go home. Ohioans should abstain from all nonessential activities. Adhering to the order will save lives and it is the responsibility of every Ohioan to do their part. We are in this together.

Will grocery stores be open?

Yes, essential services will still be operational including, but not limited to:

Grocery stores

Gas stations

Pharmacies

Police stations

Fire stations

Hospitals, clinics and healthcare operations

Garbage/sanitation

Public transportation

Public benefits (i.e. SNAP, Medicaid) hotlines

How can I get medical care if I need it?

If you are feeling sick, call your doctor, a nurse hotline, any telehealth hotline set up specifically for COVID-19 (check with your insurance company) or an urgent care center. If you are experiencing symptoms or are currently in isolation, you should stay at home and follow the guidelines provided by your physician. Do not go to an emergency room unless necessary. Nonessential medical care like eye exams and teeth-cleaning should be postponed. When possible, healthcare visits should be done remotely. Contact your healthcare provider to see what tele-health services they provide.

What if I still have to go to work?

Unless your work is an essential function (i.e. healthcare provider, grocery store clerk, first responder), you should stay home. If you have been designated essential by your employer, you should continue to go to work and practice social distancing. If you are experiencing symptoms or are currently in isolation, you should stay at home and follow the guidelines provided by your physician.

What if I think my business should be closed but I'm still being asked to operate?

Essential businesses will remain open during the Stay at Home order to provide services that are vital to the lives of Ohioans. Those businesses include, but are not limited to, pharmacies, certain government offices, and restaurants providing take-out meals. If you work for an essential business, you should continue to practice social distancing and should stay at home outside of work hours. If you believe your business is nonessential but are still being asked to show up to work, you may discuss with your employer.

Can I order food/groceries?

Yes, grocery delivery will be available as well as meal-delivery, drive through, and take-out options.

Will public transportation and ridesharing be available?

Public transportation and ridesharing should be used for essential travel only. When possible, walk, or drive yourself.

Will roads in Ohio be closed?

No, the roads will not be closed in Ohio. You should only travel if it is essential to your work or health.

Can I take a flight out of state?

Planes and any other form of travel should only be used for essential purposes.

What if my home is not a safe environment?

If it is not safe for you to remain home, you are able and urged to find another safe place to stay during this order. Please reach out so we can help. You may call the Ohio Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-934-9840 or contact your local law enforcement.

Can I visit friends and family?

For your safety, as well as the safety of those in your community, you should remain at home to help fight the spread of COVID-19. However you may travel to care for elderly, minors, dependents, persons with disabilities, or other vulnerable persons. If possible, it is recommended that you drop off supplies, food, and medication to those relatives in need of assistance, but minimize interaction.

What about my pet?

You may walk your dog and seek medical care for your pet should they require it. Be sure to practice social distancing while out on walks, maintaining at least 6 feet from other neighbors and their pets.

Does the Stay at Home order mean I can't take my kids to the park?

Families will still be able to go outside, including to parks and outdoor spaces that remain open, and take a walk, run, or bike ride but should continue to practice social distancing by remaining 6 feet away from other people. Playgrounds are closed because they pose a high risk of increasing transmission.

What is the difference between the Stay at Home order and social distancing?

Social distancing is an important first step in preventing the spread of a disease like COVID-19 that allows people to go about their daily activities while taking extra health and safety precautions. The Stay at Home order requires people to remain in their homes unless they have an essential job or are doing an essential task like going to the grocery store or walking a pet.

Can I leave home to exercise?

Yes. Outdoor exercise like running or taking a walk is perfectly acceptable; however, exercise gyms, fitness centers and associated facilities are closed to reduce the spread of coronavirus. While exercising outside, you should still practice social distancing by running or walking at least six feet away from other people.

Can I pick up meals being provided by my child's school?

Yes. Many districts and schools are continuing to support students by providing breakfast and lunch in non-congregate settings. To find a meal site near you, use the Ohio Department of Education’s interactive map or check your local district’s website or social media channels for meal distribution locations and times.

Can I go out to do laundry?

Yes. Laundromats, dry cleaners and laundry service providers are considered essential businesses that will remain open.

Bernie didn't get enough votes and he lost. It sucks but that's life. What's happening right now is him not wanting to drop out because he won't have this platform ever again.

Then it's that he wants to go to the convention with more delegates so he can broker more compromises. But he gets blown out in the next contests.

Ele paralisou as aulas na noite do dia 11/03. Todo mundo considerou o ato como político pra impedir as manifestações do dia 15/03 (provavelmente foi). Entretando, foi uma decisão extremamente acertada. A UnB (universidade federal) tentou ir contra a decisão do governador e abriu durante o dia 12/03 pela manhã. Felizmente o governador cortou a água e a luz, fazendo com que as aulas da tarde fossem canceladas.

Não tem teste para todos. Conheço pessoas que tiveram contato com políticos e autoridades sabidamente contaminados e, mesmo assim, não conseguiram ser testadas. A rede pública só testa quem está em estado grave e a rede privada só testa quem apresenta os 3 sintomas: tosse seca, dificuldade para respirar e febre.

For the past couple of months I’ve been spending a lot of time in the woods (gunpowder state park) building a fort near the ncr trail. I’m having a great time and it feels very accomplishing building things out of natural materials in the peaceful forested area. I always make sure be very respectful to the environment and the people that are hiking nearby. I know that the fort is on state owned land and I could get in trouble with the park rangers but I feel like what I’m doing isn’t necessarily negatively impacting anything. 

- I never litter and leave any garbage behind, and when I find garbage that other people have left I make sure to pick it up and bring it back to my home. 

- I never chop down living trees, I collect wood I find on the forest floor or if I see a dead tree that is still standing I will cut it down. I can tell if it’s dead if it doesn’t have bark or if it has mold on it. 

- I only have fires in a dedicated fire pit and when I leave I always make sure to completely put the fire out. The fire pit is far away from leaves and sticks so it isn’t possible for a forest fire to start. 

- I will continue to build my fort in this specific spot and I will not build forts in other parts of the woods. 

- I have made a hidden storage compartment in the ground where I store my tools so they won’t get stolen. 

- I am respectful to the hiking trails nearby and do not leave any dead wood across it. 

My main concerns is that people will report it and it will get taken down. I feel like people will see the fort and expect that I’m trashing the land, when in reality I’m cleaning up after other peoples garbage and being aware of my presence in the forest. Also, If I did get in trouble I don’t think I’d get fined because I’m 15 years old and I haven’t seen any park rangers in the area. 

This is in the gunpowder state park and I’m wondering If you guys have any suggestions for what I should do or build. I have decided that I’m going to rebuild the lean to, to make it so the tarps are under the frame and not visible. Lastly, I’d like to point out that when I stop building everything I’ll make sure to take everything down and bring home the tarps and rope. Thanks for reading this and I hope you guys stay safe and don’t catch Coronavirus."

China had the virus in November. There are many Chinese migrant workers in the Italian garment industry.  Thousands travel back and forth daily between northern Italy and Hubei province China. The virus spread from Chinese bats (proven by DNA) directly to humans or through an intermediary species, likely a pangolin. In China animal cruelty is not considered. Whole villages get together and chase down and club dogs for food. Cats, snakes, bats and thousands of other exotic animals are routinely kept alive in small cages next to on another in live animal markets. China brought us many strains of flu, SARS, MERS and many other diseases through this vector.  The Wuhan Institute of Virology also does live animal testing of many strains of coronavirus, including SARS (COVID-02). This institute is located 1 block from the large live animal  market. Almost certainly the index case arose from either the lab or the market. The most likely scenarios in order are (1) Someone working in the lab was bitten or scratched by a sick animal (2) a sick animal was incorrectly disposed if (3) bats and/or pangolins, both known to carry the disease,  transferred the virus to humans through scratching, sneezing, through mucus, or while being butchered. Bottom line: multiple strains of coronovirus, including SARS, MERS , and COVID-19 are endemic to Chinese bats.  Animals in Italy are NOT carriers of the coronoviris, and Italians do not have live animal markets to transfer these diseases."

BoJack obsessed over the fact that he wasn’t asked to participate, despite the fact that he thinks that such gestures are insipid and self-indulgent.  He thinks Mr. Peanutbutter is leaving him out as a personal insult, implying BoJack is a lesser level of celebrity than Mr. Peanutbutter sees himself. 

This leads to BoJack attempting to host multiple celebrity charity events but no one shows up to them except Todd. 

Todd has been working on a cure for coronavirus this whole time but, because he keeps having his free time usurped by mandatory attendance at BoJack’s series of failed celebrity coronavirus charity events, he is only able to create a small batch of the medication that cures coronavirus. 

Eventually, a distressed BoJack contacts Princess Carolyn and gets her to help him get a part in Mr. Peanutbutter‘s “We Are The World”-esque celebrity coronavirus charity collaborative song. 

Mr. Peanutbutter tells BoJack that the reason he didn’t ask him to be a part of it was that he knows BoJack thinks celebrity charity songs are insipid and self-indulgent. BoJack DOES think this and immediately starts to hate being involved with this at all and is annoyed by every celebrity personality who is there. He thinks they’re all miserable people, struggling to maintain their relevance by being a part of this project. (Which he is, too.) 

Mr. Peanutbutter, being an asymptomatic coronavirus carrier, accidentally gives all the other celebrity charity song participants coronavirus. There is just enough of Todd’s coronavirus cure to treat the celebrities. They strong arm the cure from Todd. Todd forgot to write down the cure’s ingredients. The celebrities don’t want anyone to know that they took all of the cure for their own benefit so Todd doesn’t get recognition for curing coronavirus or the personal satisfaction of helping people in need."

Health care in Spain is the most cost effective in the world. It means that it works very well under normal circumstances, but it is also very spartan. Right now the system is NOT overwhelmed, but it may in the next days, as the Prime Minister said yesterday. It’s for that reason that temporary hospitals have been set up in Madrid’s Fair and hotels for not life-threaten patients.

Spain has also one of the highest life expectancies in the world, similar to Italy and Japan. People over 80 that in other countries would have died with 77 or 78 are alive not because they are doing well, but because Spain holds a strong network of family support (similar to Latinos in the US, if you oblige my analogy). So in other words, in other more individualistic society like the US or the UK these elderly citizens would have been dead already. Those are the ones Coronavirus is decimating.

The reason it affected Madrid so heavily is because it is a very dense city, similar to NYC, with a major airport, and lots of economic ties to Italy, apart from tourists from all around the world."

2020-03-22,49orth,BitcoinMarkets,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/fn9zd6/the_coronavirus_bill_that_caused_the_markets_to/fl8jzir/,"[From here:](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/22/coronavirus-stimulus-congress-struggles-to-reach-a-deal.html)

The stalemate came hours after Democratic leaders warned that the bill was not to their liking because they said it did too much to bail out companies and not enough to help workers. 

Stock futures cratered as the two parties failed to agree on the terms of the package.

...

The final vote tally was 47-47, well short of the 60 votes needed to advance the bill. 

Republicans hold a 53-47 edge in the chamber, although several GOP senators, including Rand Paul, who had tested positive for the coronavirus, were not present to vote. Others, such as Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, were in quarantine as a precaution.

...

The pressure to forge a deal and pass the bill took on added urgency as several members of Congress have tested positive for the coronavirus. 

But negotiations that carried through the weekend had hit a sour note by Sunday afternoon. 

Democrats had already been frustrated that Senate Republicans drafted a bill with the administration, excluding them from the proposed bill’s original formation. 

“From my standpoint, we’re apart,” House Speaker Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters earlier Sunday.

“Leader McConnell had to postpone his 3 p.m. cloture vote (in the United States Senate, a three-fifths majority vote of the body is required to invoke cloture and terminate debate) on the motion to proceed because, thanks to Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats, he did not have the 60 votes required,” Pelosi said in a statement Sunday. 

Democrats on Sunday called out a number of issues they had with the bill, including a $500 billion fund to support “severely distressed business.” 

That includes $58 billion for passenger and cargo airlines and $17 billion for businesses critical to maintaining national security, according to a draft bill obtained by CNBC.

A previous draft bill allocated $150 billion for distressed businesses, in addition to $58 billion for airlines and cargo carriers.

The bill gave considerable authority to the Treasury to implement that fund. 

It offered concessions to Democrats like a ban on stock buybacks while a loan is outstanding and maintaining payroll “to the extent practicable,” but some worried those stipulations weren’t strong enough. One Democratic aide said that they believed the bill gave Treasury the power to waive the ban on buybacks. 

Other protections for workers and aid for hospitals were also not included. 

“In the midst of an unprecedented national crisis, Republicans can’t seriously expect us to tell people in our communities who are suffering that we shortchanged hospitals, students, workers, and small businesses but gave big corporations hundreds of billions of dollars in a secretive slush fund,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., whose home state is one of the hardest-hit by the disease’s outbreak. 

Murray is ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The panel is pushing for a number of additions, including more funding for hospitals and medical equipment. It also wants the Department of Labor to create a regulatory standard protecting frontline workers, like nurses, during crises like the coronavirus. 

The Democratic-led House Appropriations Committee previously criticized the Republican draft bill for “lack of supplemental funding for federal, state and local response.”

Airline companies were also disappointed in the bill, which offered aid primarily in the form of loans and guarantees, rather than the mix of cash grants and loans they have sought.

The bill also left open the possibility of the government participating in the gains of its loans, including through warrants, stock options or equity. Trump has he would not be opposed to taking an equity stake in companies to which the government extends aid. 

The CEOs of American, Delta, Southwest, United and others on Saturday said the industry would have to furlough workers without $29 billion in “worker payroll protection grants.” If they receive that amount in that form, they said they wouldn’t furlough employees through Aug. 31. 

Executives over the last week have sent out a series of grim letters to employees and congressional leadership, saying if the government doesn’t act fast, it could cost jobs.

Several unions also came out against the bill, urging more specific provisions to protect jobs.

“The Machinists will not support any relief package that does not put airline workers first,” said International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers’ president, Robert Martinez Jr. in a release. The union represents some 140,000 airline workers. “Unlike the bank bailout, the airline industry did not create this crisis.”"

Basically you and or kids know will come into contact with someone who has Covid-19 and they will pass it on to other people if you and everyone else don't take the necessary precautions.

Which is Basic health hygiene skills, self-isolation and maintaining social distancing.

Kids contract viruses and illnesses same as any other person the only difference is kids since they are young will recover easier.

The only reason they (federal government) don't want the schools to close down is because of two reasons first is anyone who has a job and can work from home will be forced to look after the kids, second is any Doctors or Nurses or people responsible for janitorial duties in a medical setting will be forced to stay home and look after the kids.

So basically if the kids stay home the economy (what's left of it) will fall apart and the people who are the lifeblood and run the medical infrastructure ** won't BE AVAILABLE**.

You think about on any other day when you see a kid who sneezes and coughs than think about all the disgusting people who do the exact same thing along with not washing their hands after they shit.

“Hey guys! Hope you’re all doing well! I just got this text from a friend - Pass it on to your friends and family.

FYI:
Information from Vienna’s laboratory studying COVID-19 say vast majority of people who died had ibuprofen/Advil in their system so do not take it!! Those who recovered did not take ibuprofen so if you have symptoms, take Paracetamol only!!! Looks like this virus thrives on ibuprofen so don’t do it and tell everyone you can!!!

I just spoke with my friend who is a nurse at VGH (Vancouver) and they just learnt that Advil makes the virus 10x worse.  Tylenol ONLY for the time being.  She said Advil kickstarts the virus into pneumonia. 

She also said they are not releasing the correct number of cases on the news and they have patients coming in everyday and some currently on ventilators.  Soon they won't have enough room in the hospitals to treat patients and will have to turn people away.  They've cancelled all surgeries to use the ORs for available ventilators, but it still won't be enough.  

She also said she found some people in there 40s and 50s who were previously healthy to be on ventilators and having major difficulty breathing because they took Advil. 

Also 4 doctors at VGH are now infected and she said she has never seen her doctors so worried before.  So please no Advil and stay safe!!! 

Do not take Advil - only Tylenol”

Edit: I googled, (should have first) I guess it’s up in the air right now.

New laws do not allow France to block masks that are just passing by its territories on the way to the UK.

Unfortunately the same issue has already happened within the EU against Italy, so the fact that the UK is now out of the EU is not relevant. 

Germany has blocked 830.000 masks that had been bought and paid for by an Italian company from China and were just transiting through Germany ([Lecconotizie 12 marzo)](https://lecconotizie.com/economia/lecco-economia/mascherine-bloccate-in-germania-api-tratta-per-farle-arrivare-in-italia/). This happened when Germany had blocked all export of masks (but again these were not German exports, they were transiting). The news is from March 12. The situation was in theory solved after discussion between authorities,  but in practice the masks were nowhere to be found. Recent news says masks have been delivered on March 21 - ten days later than due - to Italy.
[La provincia di Lecco](https://www.laprovinciadilecco.it/stories/lecco-citta/liberate-le-mascherine-bloccate-in-germania_1345945_11/). 

Czech Republic has now blocked 680.000 masks and 28.000 ventilators that had been donated from China to Italy.  ([Fanpage.it 22 marzo](https://www.fanpage.it/attualita/coronavirus-680mila-mascherine-sequestrate-in-repubblica-ceca-erano-un-dono-della-cina-allitalia/). The excuse here is that authorities wanted to block “illegal smuggling”. Only after three days they admitted the “mistake”, but again masks and ventilators have disappeared somewhere in the Czech Republic. Again, they have practically been stolen. Now the Czech government is somehow saying they will arrange the masks to be sent again to Italy soon.  

There  is nothing that will repay those missing masks at the time when they were most needed.

Those cargos should reach their destination, whether they are paid for or donated. 

Blocking them is a disgusting move from any government and it’s unjustifiable under international law in whatever direction it’s done, whether within  or outside the EU."

* Is this legal?
* What can I do about it?

The answer to the first question is not one anyone on this sub will answer. Primarily due to the the reasons linked to in the automod post. Second of all, even if they could give an answer which is right 99% of the time, the world is currently going bonkers right now - and the usual answer might not always be right.

The answer to your second question about where to you complain to is also found in the automod link. ACCC.gov.au also has a bunch of stuff. I will prewarn you that while the various government bodies are open for business, things are crazy right now (many government departments have been swamped, and on top of that they are also having to manage the shutdown - expect your typically slow government service to be ever slower)

One thing to check might also be your travel insurance  (you got travel insurance right?). Again prewarning, it is going to be hit and miss whether your travel insurance claim is accepted as some (not all) policies have exclusions in them if this is a Coronavirus cancellation. Finally, if you paid by credit card, check whether you have insurance attached to that. Some cards have insurance attached to them, and plenty of people forget that they signed up to insurance when they took out the card. Again your mileage will vary - you are probably shit of luck if there is a pandemic exclusion or similar in there.

There is a not-so-secret third option though. Get in contact with their complaints team in writing (be firm but polite! Regardless of the actual laws, being an asshore to an overworked and underpaid customer service person will get you a Computer Says No answer), point out whatever clause it is in the T&C you figure gets you a refund, and see what happens."

In a small, 36-patient study by French researchers published earlier this month, it was shown effective in killing the novel coronavirus.

Combined with the antibiotic azithromycin, a subset of six patients all tested negative for the bug by the sixth day, the researchers found.

Sounds promising. Read the damn articles you post, goddammit."

It is complete bullshit, because for whatever reason there are a lot of people in time of global crisis who enjoy simply making shit up and spreading it as widely as possible.  Not blaming you, OP, but rather morons like Alex Jones who immediately turn every event into a conspiracy theory, and damn the evidence.

>It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted7,11. Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used19. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone20. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage could have given rise to SARS-CoV-2."
