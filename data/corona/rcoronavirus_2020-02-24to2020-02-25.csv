''

1. The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28\[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)\] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3\[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)\] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.
2. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%\[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)\] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%\[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)\] .
3. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms\[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)\] . This makes it much more difficult to control.
4. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention\[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)\] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu\[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)\].
5. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month\[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)\] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days\[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)\] .
6. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2\[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)\] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.
7. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. *See*, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21).''

There is a large population of Chinese students at most universities here, which I I assumed to be the biggest risk up until the idea of localized is becoming more realistic, but school started January 13th so if there were any cases from those kids, I think we would’ve heard about it by now."

because temperature checks help countries stop infected symptomatic people who would otherwise spread the disease, and PCR tests that confirm infection allow for an easier time tracing contacts. 

Both of these measures help to greatly slow an outbreak. Sure, they might not be bulletproof, but they will help slow down an outbreak, and reduce load on hospitals/healthcare facilities by reducing the number of people infected at any given time."

If something infects a 3rd of the population with even a 2% death rate that's 50 million dead, and given it's ratio of severe cases about 500 million hospitalized, we are not even remotely ready for that scenario, globalism has interconnected the world making disease spread faster and has made us dependent on other countries for economic stability, if the system crumbles due to a global pandemic with that sort of impact people will be worrying not only about getting sick but where can they get food, their general safety etc.

Plus, unlike China, we don't have manufacturing facilities to produce masks, so we rely on imports. Which are getting scarcer by the day.  WTF is our govt thinking?!?

In the outbreak’s wake, the global health community scrambled to deliver initiatives for increased health security. One flagship programme was the World Bank’s Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF). **Under the scheme, investors who buy pandemic bonds receive generous ‘coupons’, which annually pay about 13% interest. This compensates investors for the risk that the bonds will make ‘insurance’ payouts to fight pandemics under certain conditions.** **Otherwise, cash returns to the investors when the bonds mature in July 2020.**"

I am from the US and can confidently say our healthcare system is broken beyond belief. While I am not denying you saying we have some of the best healthcare in the world, because we do, I am going to point out that it does not matter how good it is when people **DO NOT GO TO THE DOCTORS**.

When I go see my cardiologist (and I have a decent PPO through my employer) just for a check up, my costs are $500. Now, because of my insurance, I do not have to pay that. Lets say though, someone doesn't have my insurance, and going to the doctor to get that bill (on top of the time the loose more than likely in wages seeing said doctor) it is crippling.

Do not mistake the actual quality of our care to the third-world tendencies of **HOW** our healthcare system is run.

A full scale breakout in the US could very well happen, and it might. I will confidently say that if it does, it could be very bad simply **BECAUSE** of our healthcare system."

The public is smart. They quickly figure out when they are being lied to, and then learn to distrust those channels.

At the World Health Organization, Foreign Minister Maas reserves the right to take tougher measures - and finds out how expensive a vaccine will be.Christoph Schult reports from GenevaFebruary 24, 2020, 7:37 pmAt the Palais des Nations, the headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, visitors are greeted with leaflets. They explain the hygiene measures to be taken in the face of a possible corona pandemic: wash your hands regularly, sneeze and cough in the crook of your arm, avoid contact with sick people, wear a respirator in case of fever.

Heiko Maas actually came to Geneva to promote his ""Alliance of Multilateralists"" at the UN. But in view of the Corona crisis, the Foreign Minister makes a detour to the World Health Organization in the morning. In brilliant sunshine and spring-like temperatures, he walks over to WHO headquarters.

Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomes his guest in front of the WHO building. It is a sign of gratitude, after all, Maas brings the promise of three million euros in additional emergency aid. In English, the Ethiopian thanks for the ""great support from Germany"", and adds in German: ""Thank you very much.""

WHO experts consider risk of global crisis highTedros takes the minister down to the WHO crisis room. Here, the scale of the outbreak of Covid 19, as the disease is officially called, becomes clear. Graphs on screens show how dramatic the situation is. A huge map of the world shows how rapidly the virus has spread in recent weeks. Red circles of different sizes show how many infections the individual countries have registered so far. China: more than 5000 cases, South Korea: between 501 and 5000 cases. Germany is therefore in the same category as Italy and France: 101 to 500 cases.

After the recent deaths in Italy, Maas wants to know behind closed doors what scenario the WHO people consider likely. According to this, the experts hardly believe in an eradication of the virus. Either local endemics would remain or the outbreaks would combine to form a worldwide pandemic, according to the forecast. A few weeks ago this was considered rather unlikely, but now the risk of a global crisis is considered high. The Geneva health experts' message is that we must prepare for this.

Germany has so far reacted in an exemplary manner, praise Maas' hosts. They cite the convertible roof manufacturer in Stockdorf as an example. By intervening early, the Bavarian company had succeeded in locating and isolating the patient ""zero"" and his contact persons, thus preventing the spread of the virus.However, the disease has not yet been sufficiently researched. The fact that some people are apparently infected but show no or hardly any symptoms is proving to be insidious. This means that in Italy the virus has probably been passed on by people who do not know that they are carrying it in their bodies. This makes containment difficult, the search for the patient ""zero"" almost impossible. ""It is unclear from when exactly and for how long an infected person is contagious,"" the current situation report of the Federal Foreign Office also states.

According to the WHO experts, the quality of the health system is crucial for combating the disease. About 20 per cent of the diseases are serious. In countries with good health care, it is possible to keep mortality below one per cent, but in developing countries the risk increases. The WHO is therefore currently very concerned about the situation in Iran. However, the situation in Japan, South Korea and Italy shows that other countries are not immune to a crisis.

""We are monitoring developments in real time, so to speak""Heiko Meuse""We're finding that the virus is spreading further,"" says Maas. ""However, we must not dramatise the situation. I think it will be particularly difficult if the virus spreads to regions that are not developed in the way it has.""

Developing, producing, distributing vaccines - that costs billions of eurosHowever, the Foreign Minister hints that the deaths in Italy could also worsen the situation in Germany. However, the Federal Government does not consider an automatic quarantine for all travellers to China to be necessary - at least not yet. ""As in many other countries, not all people coming from China will have to be quarantined,"" said Maas. ""However, we are monitoring developments in real time, so to speak, and can react to a changed situation at any time. We also reserve the right to do so."" At the moment, says the Foreign Minister, there is no reason to deviate from the previous approach.

Outside the WHO headquarters, Maas passes a bronze sculpture. It shows a doctor vaccinating a child in the upper arm. On this day it is a reminder that research on ""Covid 19"" is still in its infancy. Because one thing is certain: with a few million from Germany, the world community will not be able to get the corona crisis under control. A vaccine is needed for this. The Foreign Minister learned during his visit that developing, producing and distributing this vaccine would cost several billion euros.

The United States has already declared a public health emergency which allows them to mobilize funds in order to waive the requirements in order to get on Medicaid or CHIP, our adult and child govement health program. It also allows for unprecedented negotiation of drug prices and drug reimbursement .  of course, they have to choose to do this for it to matter. It isn't default.

The good news about this? It isn't up to the president of the United States. It's up to the Secretary of the department of health and human services, the same person who declared this an emergency. Who is of the mind this is a pandemic. We can only hope that this man will choose to mobilize these funds if pandemic level severe infections reach the United States. 

Of course ... We may not have enough ventilators. Or beds. If we open up emergency shelters (Like what we use during severe inclement weather) as hospitals, or used some of our indoor sporting areas, we'd have enough places to put sick people. If we demanded that any and all ventilators currently residing within DMEs or within a manufacturer's warehouse in the US, as well as all decommissioned but still operating low feature vents be used....we *probably* can mostly survive this pandemic. 

The breakdown on United States for those who are interested: according to a cladex study there are max 160,000 useable vents in the nation. If this pandemic were to be as bad as the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, we'd need to vent over 600k people. We don't have 600k vents. If it stayed relatively mild, like the 1958 H2N2 pandemic, over 64,000 people would need ventilated which we could easily handle. So. Toss up as to if we can handle it."

Now a quick test should bring clarity.  The patient is currently complaining about fever, the city said on Monday.
