I also read recently that Capt. Crozier was approached by his officers to sign a joint statement urging the Navy to help.

[Capt. Crozier prevented that statement because he knew it would get his officers in trouble.](https://www.businessinsider.com/navy-officers-brett-crozier-wanted-to-sign-letter-2020-4)

> Senior officers aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier reeling from a coronavirus outbreak offered to sign a revealing letter about the dire situation, only to be denied by the ship's commander, Capt. Brett Crozier.

> **Crozier feared for their careers and denied their request, according to The New York Times.**


And as we know, he instead sounded the alarm *himself*. He took on the responsibility to reach as many people as he could to help his crew."

A: Several large media outlets have been stating that one of the findings emerging from Iceland’s coronavirus screening of the general population is that around 50% of individuals infected with the virus have no symptoms. The screenings of the general population have been carried out by Reykjavík-based medical research company deCODE genetics, so Iceland Review asked their CEO Dr. Kári Stefánsson to clear up this assertion.

Kári stated the claim is an oversimplification. “Fifty per cent of those that test positive in our screenings of the general population are symptom-free at the time. Many of them get symptoms later,” Kári said.

Therefore, although about half of those who have tested positive for coronavirus in deCODE’s screenings did not have symptoms at the time, most of those who have tested positive developed symptoms at some point. A positive sample from an individual without symptoms means that the sample was most likely taken early in the virus’ incubation period, before symptoms such as dry cough or fever began to present themselves.

“DeCODE has now screened 10,401 individuals in Iceland. Of those, 92 were positive. So about 0.9% of those who we screened in the general population turned out to be positive. And that is probably the upper limit of the distribution of the virus in society in general,” Kári explained.

Iceland Review’s interview with Kári reveals more about the findings from deCODE’s screenings and how they could help the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apr 13, 2020, 11:02 am

Michigan’s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has become one of Republicans’ favorite targets. Many believe it’s because Whitmer is widely considered a potential running mate pick for former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tried and failed to join the pile-on party.

Cruz on Sunday retweeted an article about a recent Michigan emergency order that allows fines of up to $1,000 for violating social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. The article included a photo of Whitmer doing a ceremonial signing while a group of people looked on.

“As I count it,” Cruz complained, “that’s $11K right there….”

There was just one problem with Cruz’s attempted dunk: The picture was more than a year old.

Within an hour, Whitmer herself corrected him. She tweeted that the old photo was “being misused to spread fear and anger.”

“I know you would never intentionally mislead the public during a pandemic, so I’m hopeful you’ll correct this mistake as soon as possible,” Whitmer added.

“Stay safe, & happy Easter from Michigan.”

Hello Senator! This photo is from January of 2019, and is being misused to spread fear and anger. I know you would never intentionally mislead the public during a pandemic, so I’m hopeful you’ll correct this mistake as soon as possible. Stay safe, & happy Easter from Michigan

Instead of preparing for the pandemic, Trump went [golfing multiple times at the Trump International Golf Club](https://trumpgolfcount.com/displayoutings) and funneled the budget of the secret service into his own pocket.

Therefore I'm going to talk about the evidence across multiple pandemics, not just the Spanish Flu. At the end I also mention a bit of US work that looks at comparisons between US states. 

As you can imagine, current events are prompting a rush of papers on the economic impacts of pandemics, including one that explicitly looks at economic activity in the medium to longer-term, by Òscar Jordà, Sanjay R. Singh, and Alan M. Taylor. They looked at 15 large pandemics with at least 100,000 deaths, the earliest being Black Death of the 14th century, and up to the H1N1 Pandemic of 2009. The timeframe was up to 40 years after the pandemic. Their work is fairly European focused, because much of the economic historical research that produces the sort of useful statistics before modern-times has focused on Europe due to the availability of researchers and also the interest in why the Industrial Revolution started in Britain. 

They find ongoing impacts to interest rates and wages, in opposite directions. Interest rates fall, wages rise, though the rise in wages is somewhat smaller. To quote them on interest rates: 

>Following a pandemic, the natural rate of interest declines for decades thereafter, reaching its nadir about 20 years later, with the natural rate about 150 bps lower had the pandemic not taken place. At about four decades later, the natural rate returns to the level it would be expected to have had the pandemic not taken place.

They do find variations between European contries, with much bigger impacts in France, Italy and Spain compared to the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. 

For the wage impact they say:

>The response of real wages is almost the mirror image of the response of the natural
rate of interest, with its effects being felt over decades. The figure shows that real wages
gradually increase until about three decades after the pandemic, where the cumulative
deviation in the real wage peaks at about 5%.

They don't state if similar inter-country variation appears for wages as it did for interest rates.

The rise in wages is in all probability due to labour scarcity relative to capital following the deaths of a significant share of the labour force, much of the past pandemics happened when life expectancies were much lower so very few people survived to their 70s or 80s, and the Spanish Flu famously hit young people unusually hard. So we may not see the same impact from covid-19 due to the differing age pattern of deaths.

The cause of the fall in interest rates is less certain, it may be due to the large share of capital after the disaster relative to surviving labour, and/or due to people wanting to save more in response to the shock.  

Note that this is very new work and some errors may be discovered in it in future months. 

The St Louis Federal Reserve in 2007 published a report on pandemics which surveys the economic research on the impact of the Spanish flu on the USA, where inter-state comparisons can be used. The papers they discuss similarly find a rise in wages (specifically manufacturing wages), in line with the Jorda paper. Interestingly, one of their referenced papers (the paper itself is unpublished) finds a rise in per capita income growth, and argues that it's down to a larger capital share per surviving worker. Money is notoriously more transferable than labour, particularly within a currency zone, so unsurprisingly the St Louis survey doen't mention any US research on interest rate impacts.

I hope this is informative, even though it's not specific to the 1918 Spanish flu.

This child is more likely than not acting out in this way because their entire world was flipped upside down by coronavirus. Kids thrive on routine, and this kid’s routine doesn’t exist anymore. This kid definitely isn’t in control of their circumstances, and they’re aware of the stress this situation is causing their parents & the other adults in their life, and even though they can’t articulate that they’re stressed and scared and uncertain, they probably feel all those things. A lot of kids are acting out right now in one way or another, because they need to feel like they can control something. What this kid needs is compassion, empathy and understanding. Talk to them, love them, and reassure them that things are going to be okay. “You’re right, if I eat these chips now, you can’t have them later, and that’s okay. You can pick another snack, and next time we get groceries, we’ll buy another bag. Thankfully, there are lots of people working very hard to make sure that grocery stores have all the food we like.” Let them know that it’s okay to be scared, because this is scary, and reassure them that you love them. And if you need a break, because you’re stressed and scared yourself, take one. We all need a little extra self-care right now.

I've honestly, truly thought about buying rural land, building a yurt and a couple of big storage sheds on it, and just living there until a medical condition I can't afford finally kills me. I mean, I already spent two years living in a van and another two years living literally on the back porch of a mobile home in the middle of the midwest, a big private yurt sounds like a mansion in comparison.

How's that for the fucking American dream?  The average 'essential job' can't pay for just rent, transportation, and food. If there's any single benefit to coronavirus, it's that millennials may become the voting majority much sooner than expected and we're fucking chomping at the bit to tear this place down and start fresh.

It's all over Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, S Korea...etc. There is zero chance of wet markets shutting  down anytime soon. 

They are basically the Asian version of farmer markets, but of course, some sell more stuff than others (looking at you China....). It stems from Asian culture that chases the freshest ingredients, so instead of doing weekly shopping at supermarkets like the West, most housewives and elderly do their food shopping daily at one of these wet markets.

Most families in Hong Kong do their food shopping at wet markets, as they offer cheaper, fresher produce and has more options than the supermarket chains.

That being said, wet markets are not the problem, most markets in Asia are wet markets. They’re just called markets. The problem is the unregulated exotic wild meat being mixed in with it. And China has taken steps to address that 

Shenzhen, one of the largest cities in China, introduced regulations to wet markets. These are rules defining the consumption of animals. The new legislation defined animals that can be eaten. Many wildlife, including bats and pangolins, are not on the list.

The new regulations also banned slaughtering animals publicly and in your own house. Basically no live animals can be sold for food purposes. If you want to eat meat, they have to come from legitimate butchers that can be regulated by the government.

>**Many patients have experienced their sense of smell and taste dissipating. Did you feel that?**

> Yes. It's been written about, and I certainly experienced it and perhaps I can share an insight. I am unsure but am guessing that the cranial nerve responsible for taste and smell may not be affected by coronavirus. Early on, I noticed a biofilm in my mouth, and I couldn't taste very well at all, even though I knew I should be eating and trying to maintain my nutrition. Physicians at the hospital did examine my mouth, but no one saw any pathology. When I finally coughed up sputum, the now infamous black sputum, it grew candida, a fungus associated with the loss of taste but not necessarily smell. My speculation is that this virus immunosuppresses people. Remember my white blood count was very low and remained low for quite a while, so one is susceptible to a supra-infection, in this case a fungal infection possibly causing this clinical finding and concern.
> 
> **Right. My understanding is that is what thrush is, right? Usually that's an early sign that you may have an HIV infection or something, because you're immunocompromised and can't keep yeast out.**
> 
> Correct. It happens in diabetics, but it also happens in healthy people. An example are those asthmatics who are using cortisone spray to address their asthma. That's probably where pulmonologists see it most commonly because, as they say, fungus grows where the sun don't shine — the mouth, rectally, vaginally, under armpits, under breasts and skinfolds. Fungus grows in the mouth when you're using cortisone sprays commonly. When I finally coughed up a sputum that had candida in it, I was not on any cortisone inhalation just albuterol therapy. Perhaps the lack of taste and even smell is associated.
> 
> **That's interesting. So, in theory, perhaps it's not actually the coronavirus that results in the lack of taste, but the compromised immune system that caused candida or other infection?**
> 
> Right, a supra-infections. And this in general is a mild one. It's a surface infection, it's not a system infection. The biofilm that perceived in my mouth is getting better but remains and is improving with therapy addressing the fungal infection."

Crozier also flagged his concerns about challenges of trying to contain the virus aboard the ship and requested that sailors be allowed to quarantine on land.

At least where I'm from, we have not forgotten what the Spanish influenza did to our people. Mortality rates for Maori were far above those of pakeha. There's mass graves in a lot of our areas, hillocks where children were buried. 

It's easy to see why Maori are more vulnerable to coronavirus: We are over represented in low SES communities, and have worse health outcomes than others. Our elderly also interact much more widely with younger populations, and our cultural mannerisms bring more physical contact between people.

4. We made light of this virus by comparing it to the flu, but I hope we learn to start taking the flu more seriously. Too many elderly and immunocompromised are killed by common influenza. I think that during flu season, we should continue to offer some of the services stores have provided during coronavirus. For example, bringing goods to pharmacy window for immunocompromised.

8. We pay A LOT for our medical care. The most in the world. I'm sure there's some way to take a few cents of that to devote to our national security by manufacturing PPE here.

“Two groups of governors, one on the East Coast and one on the West Coast, announced Monday that they were forming regional working groups to help plan when it would be safe to begin to ease restrictions to reopen their economies.

Their announcements came hours after President Trump, who has expressed impatience to reopen the economy, wrote on Twitter that such a decision lies with the president, not the states.

“Well, seeing as we had the responsibility for closing the state down,” Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania said, “I think we probably have the primary responsibility for opening it up.”

He joined the governors of Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island on a conference call, where they agreed to create a committee of public health officials, economic development officials and their chiefs of staff to work together as they decide when to ease the restrictions they have put in place to slow the spread of the virus. They said they did not necessarily expect to act together or to create a one-size-fits-all solution, but they stressed the need for regional cooperation.
On the West Coast, the governors of California, Oregon and Washington also announced Monday what they called a Western States Pact to work together on a joint approach to reopening economies. They said that while each state would have its own specific plan, the states would build out a West Coast strategy that would include how to control the virus in the future. “Our states will only be effective by working together,” they said in a joint statement.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Monday that he had been in discussions with the other governors to coordinate efforts on the West Coast. He said that on Tuesday he would outline the “California-based thinking” on reopening and promised it would be guided by “facts,” “evidence” and “science.””[article from New York Times live update page (part of article)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/coronavirus-updates.html)"

They tested the entire town and then it went on lockdown and then retested again 2 weeks later.   They found similar large numbers of people that were infected and asymptomatic.

And similar to the cruise ship where they did testing.   In that case only 18 percent were asymptomatic but that could be because cruise ships would have larger numbers of older people.  So this could have skewed the data.

[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00885-w](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00885-w)

While it is early days it seems that large numbers of people who are infected either have no symptoms or very mild responses.    You can see this already changing policy.    Example is the recommendation to wear a mask in public even a make shift one.    This would reduce the spread of the virus from people who are infected but asymptomatic.

Regarding that first link at the top, it also mentions:


- “Bat coronaviruses at Wuhan [Center for Disease Control] and Wuhan Institute of Virology routinely were collected and studied at BSL-2, which provides only minimal protections against infection of lab workers.”

- One early study “conducted by the South China University of Technology, [that] concluded that the coronavirus **‘probably’ originated in the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention,” located just 280 meters** from the Hunan Seafood Market often cited as the source of the original outbreak. “The paper was later removed from ResearchGate, a commercial social-networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers,” 

- ""Lab safety has been a problem in China. "" 
---

- ""A safety breach at a Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab is believed to have **caused four suspected SARS cases, including one death, in Beijing in 2004.""** 

- **""A similar accident caused 65 lab workers** of Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute to be infected with brucellosis in December 2019,” Huang wrote.

- And US labs have problems too: ""In 2014, the agency revealed that staff had accidently sent live anthrax between laboratories, exposing 84 workers. In an investigation, officials found other mishaps that had occurred in the preceding decade.""

Such as:

> Ebright described a December video from the Wuhan CDC that shows staffers “collecting bat coronaviruses with inadequate [personal protective equipment] and unsafe operational practices.” Separately, I reviewed two Chinese articles, from 2017 and 2019, describing the heroics of Wuhan CDC researcher Tian Junhua, who while capturing bats in a cave **“forgot to take protective measures” so that “bat urine dripped from the top of his head like raindrops.”**

...as well as more in the article.

There are almost always some incompetent idiots around anywhere, and the labs are basically playing with fire in messing with these viruses... and now COVID19 is probably a result of that.

I forgot to mention this article (from 2014):

https://nationalpost.com/news/a-brief-terrifying-history-of-viruses-escaping-from-labs-70s-chinese-pandemic-was-a-lab-mistake


The whole article is good to read, but a summary is:

> **The danger of a manmade pandemic sparked by a laboratory escape is not hypothetical:** One occurred in 1977, and it occurred because of concern that a natural pandemic was imminent. Many other laboratory escapes of high-consequence pathogens have occurred, resulting in transmission beyond laboratory personnel. Ironically, these laboratories were working with pathogens to prevent the very outbreaks they ultimately caused. For that reason, the tragic consequences have been called **“self-fulfilling prophecies.”**

- The swine flu scare of 1976 and the H1N1 human influenza pandemic of 1977

- Smallpox releases in Great Britain

- Venezuelan equine encephalitis in 1995

- SARS outbreaks **after** the 2003 epidemic

- Foot-and-mouth disease in the U.K. in 2007

> It is hardly reassuring that, despite stepwise technical improvements in containment facilities and increased policy demands for rigorous biosecurity procedures in the handling of dangerous pathogens, potentially high-consequence breaches of biocontainment occur nearly daily: **In 2010, 244 unintended releases of bioweapon candidate “select agents” were reported.**

---

As the doctor who wrote that article in 2014 said:

> Looking at the problem pragmatically, **the question is not if such escapes will result in a major civilian outbreak, but rather what the pathogen will be and how such an escape may be contained, if indeed it can be contained at all.**"

Our profound thanks go to the NHS and all key workers for the invaluable roles they are fulfilling at this critical time.

The footballing world is now recognising the current and potential future impact of the pandemic. It has destabilised businesses, clubs and the sport we all love – along with the rest of the football eco-system and its dependents.

All clubs will be facing different pressures. The cessation of our Club’s operations, particularly given our stadium’s use as a multi-purpose venue, has come at a challenging time for us.

In addition to the postponement of football, we have had rugby, concerts, boxing events and conferences postponed or cancelled. Since our results for the year end 30 June 2019, our net debt has risen, as anticipated, as we continued to invest in the team and completed budgeted capital projects.

In these uncertain times, we have to ensure we are in a position to meet our financial obligations and protect the Club’s ability to be able to operate when football returns. However, we also need, importantly, to support our wider communities and the NHS. This has been a week when we have worked hard to do both.

In our last update we said we would keep our position under review, especially in the context of revised budgets and cost cutting. Having done so we have decided that all non-playing staff, whether full-time, casual or furloughed, will receive 100 per cent of their pay for April and May. Only the Board will take salary reductions.

With no clarity on when football might resume and under what conditions, we shall continue to keep this under on-going review. We should like to thank our staff for their incredible support and understanding.

We are acutely aware that many supporters were against the decision we made regarding furloughing staff who could not carry out their jobs from home - due to the nature of their work - and our intention to apply, if applicable, for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), a scheme  designed to ensure that jobs and employment rights are protected.

Indeed we have seen opposition from fans to fellow Premier League clubs accessing the CJRS too.  This once again underlines that we bear different pressures to other businesses, many of whom have and will continue to apply for support from the scheme as the Government intended.

In view of supporter sentiment regarding the scheme, it is now not our intention to make use of the current CJRS that runs until the end of May. We shall consult with stakeholders, including the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust with whom we have been in dialogue over the past week and who share our desire to protect jobs, should circumstances change going forward.

Daniel Levy, Chairman: “The criticism the Club has received over the last week has been felt all the more keenly because of our track record of good works and our huge sense of responsibility to care for those that rely on us, particularly locally.

“It was never our intent, as custodians, to do anything other than put measures in place to protect jobs whilst the Club sought to continue to operate in a self-sufficient manner during uncertain times.

“We regret any concern caused during an anxious time and hope the work our supporters will see us doing in the coming weeks, as our stadium takes on a whole new purpose, will make them proud of their Club.”

Equipment has now been installed in our stadium to operate drive-through COVID-19 testing and swabbing for NHS staff, families and their dependents. Our Tottenham Hotspur Stadium becomes the first Premier League ground to be used for testing, following on from other sporting venues around the world.

Additionally, the stadium has been re-purposed and fitted out to house the North Middlesex Hospital’s Women’s Outpatient Services, freeing up much-needed capacity at the hospital itself to treat patients with COVID symptoms, whilst supporting the redirection of pregnant women away from the hospital during the pandemic.

This will result in recognisable areas of our stadium being transformed for clinical use:

• Our Media Entrance and Café will be used as a main reception and welfare area for visitors and NHS staff.
• The NFL Away changing room areas will be used as a Maternal Day Unit.
• Our Flash interview rooms off of the players’ tunnel – where post-match TV interviews are normally conducted – as well as the referees’ area, will be used as consultation and scanning rooms.
• The football Away dressing room area will be used as a Midwives Clinical Room and staff Admin Office.

The stadium’s ‘pitch pocket’ in the basement has for several weeks now been used as a distribution hub by the London Food Alliance – a new scheme set up to ensure food supplies for the most vulnerable people within the capital.

Vegetable produce from our Kitchen Garden at the Training Centre is being provided to the food distribution hub.

Our staff have been already been, and others will be joining them, volunteering to support the NHS activities at the stadium.

This weekend also saw the Design, Technology and Engineering equipment in the Club-funded London Academy of Excellence Tottenham, based alongside the Club’s offices at Lilywhite House, being used to produce protective face shields for the NHS. Thanks to the work of the DT staff of the LAET’s education sponsor, Highgate School, our local hospitals have taken delivery of the first 950 face shields with 1,000 expected to be produced weekly. We have always been proud of the staff and the school – never more so now.

Our Foundation will continue to deliver its programmes online - including virtual sessions for:

- Those on its ‘Move 4 You’ cancer rehabilitation programme.
- Virtual seated exercise classes delivered within local elderly care homes.
- Employment advice and up-skilling activities.
- Functional Skills courses.
- Personal development and character-building activities.

Foundation staff are being trained to undertake a series of phone calls to those considered most vulnerable across our local Boroughs, including those who would normally be engaged in Foundation projects.

We are committed to playing our part to ensure the best possible outcomes for our communities during these unprecedented times.

Stay home. Stay safe. Protect the NHS"""

He said that not Biden himself, but a Biden administration would have navigated us through this crisis leagues better than how Trump and his administration have handled it. That's almost verbatim. 

And no, I'm not going to try to find a timestamp from a fucking 12 hour stream, but I remember it stood out because chat started spamming ""LIB PepeLa"" 

I fucking cannot stand Biden, but some people here have clearly let Trump's ""new normal"" take away their sense of what actual normalcy would be. There might be a brick wall between Trump and Biden on their policy beliefs, but there is a goddamn ocean that separates them when it comes to anything that even slightly resembles ""leadership"" skills. Trump has torn the government and its roles down internally so bad and has defunded so many departments that the function of government in many areas is starting to fall apart, ranging from losing the pandemic response team and a majority of the CDC all the way to the fucking USPS collapsing in on itself, because in Trump's ideal world it would be taken over by the private sector.

If you dipshits genuinely believe there isn't a difference in Biden and Trump in that regard, then you're a complete fucking idiot. Sorry. I hate Biden, I canvassed for Bernie, I did my best. Coming on here and trying to convince other people that Trump and Biden's administrations would have no discernable difference is moronic. Put yourselves in the shoes of the people whose lives have been destroyed by Trump policies. It's easy for you to do when you don't have one spot missing at the dinner table every night because your dad or husband or brother was whisked away by ICE in the middle of their lunch break 7 months ago, or because they died from coronavirus after being refused testing 3 times."

""President Trump is expected to move this week to curb U.S. funding for the World Health Organization, after raging at the WHO for accepting China’s initial downplaying of coronavirus. It’s clear the WHO will be a fat target as Trump deflects attention from damning new details emerging about his horribly botched coronavirus response.

As part of this latest exercise in blame-shifting, Trump has taken his first public shot at Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and his own administration’s leading medical expert. Trump angrily retweeted a call for Fauci’s firing, while again hailing his own early restrictions on travel from China and furiously bashing the media for failing to recognize that decision’s foresight and brilliance.

Underlying this rage-fest at all these targets is an actual argument: All criticism of his response pales beside this one travel decision, which he undertook in defiance of his own experts, the media, and international organizations, thus underscoring his brave and heroic leadership.

But this story line is profoundly absurd, for two very fundamental reasons. Amid new signs that it will be absolutely central to his efforts to erase his role in unleashing this catastrophe, it’s worth engaging frontally.

The first reason this narrative is nonsense is that Trump committed a whole range of other extraordinarily serious missteps whose consequences continued to play out for weeks and weeks after Trump imposed that ban, in spite of whatever good it did.

Trump and his allies are making two claims about the WHO and China simultaneously. They claim the WHO was too credulous about China’s initial deceptions about the threat, hampering our response here.

Even as they’re claiming this, they’re also hailing Trump for his early recognition of the threat posed by the China outbreak. Thus the Jan. 31 travel restrictions, which Trump has described as “the biggest decision we made so far.”

As an initial matter, the hyping of this decision is ridiculous. At least 40,000 people traveled from China to the United States in the two months after Trump imposed it. As the New York Times pointed out, it may have “come too late” to meaningfully limit the threat coronavirus from China posed.

But even if one were to accept Trump’s spin, it’s still not exonerating in the least when it comes to Trump’s broader failures. That’s because those failures badly exacerbated the situation that unfolded here after Trump imposed that ban.

The Times’s utterly damning weekend exposé of all these failures illustrates this with great clarity.

For instance, on Jan. 30 — the day before Trump’s heroic travel restrictions — Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar directly warned Trump about the seriousness of the looming pandemic. Yet Trump dismissed the warning as “alarmist.”

Meanwhile, Trump’s dithering held back the response in numerous ways: Plans for a federal system to track the virus were “delayed for weeks,” which, along with the well-documented failure to ramp up testing, left officials with “almost no insight” into its spread.

Meanwhile, in late February, administration officials concluded Trump should communicate the need for strict social distancing measures far more urgently. But Trump privately raged about these warnings, because they spooked the markets, and “crucial additional weeks went by before their views were reluctantly accepted by the president — time when the virus spread largely unimpeded.”

All that occurred here after Trump’s travel restrictions — and the catastrophic consequences continue to unfold right now.

Trump’s argument is akin to a baseball manager citing a double play in the second inning as proof of his team’s fielding prowess, to rebut criticism of a string of subsequent errors that went on to allow the other team to score 10 runs.

Only in this case, untold lives are at stake. Confirmed U.S. cases now exceed half a million and confirmed U.S. deaths total over 22,000.

The second reason Trump’s narrative is nonsense is this: Even though Trump did impose the travel restrictions — with limited effect — Trump himself didn’t actually show the level of initial skepticism toward China’s public claims that he’s faulting everyone else for failing to show.

Again and again throughout the month of February, Trump expressed confidence in China’s handling of coronavirus and/or said China shouldn’t do anything differently.

To be fair, Trump had understandable reasons for this. He wanted to maintain good relations to secure trade peace and to get needed medical supplies.

But there’s another point here that continues to elude notice: Trump’s praise of China’s handling of coronavirus was absolutely central to his own downplaying of the threat. Again and again, Trump cited China’s successes to argue that through collaboration, Trump and China were restraining coronavirus.

Thus, Trump’s praise of China was central to maintaining his own early spin that he, too, had it totally under control. That turned out to be catastrophically wrong, and it’s only after this became too overwhelming to ignore that Trump, joined by his propagandists, fully pivoted to blaming China, the current story line.

As if this narrative weren’t absurd enough, Trump’s attacks on the WHO to prop it up make it still worse. Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow at the Center on Foreign Relations, correctly points out that even if the WHO did commit early missteps on China, it righted itself as more data came in.

Indeed, the WHO declared an international public health emergency on Jan. 30, right around the time of Trump’s travel restrictions. In so doing, the WHO alerted us and the world to the threat — and the vast bulk of Trump’s missteps unfolded after that, as did their horrifying consequences.

Meanwhile, experts are warning that defunding the WHO could prove disastrous when the outbreak gains steam in the southern hemisphere. It would be perverse indeed if Trump’s actions end up hampering efforts to save more lives abroad, mainly to sustain a ham-handed effort to cover up his own role in needlessly lost lives here."""

Bernie’s wing has won the ideological battle.  So what if your seventy something year old activist didn’t get on the podium himself?  The party platform leans left, the Coronavirus is pushing the American view leftward, and the GOP is held up by an orange monkey.  A dangerous orange monkey, but a monkey.  

There’s no time better than now to vote left, but more importantly, vote for the Senators and Representatives that will force Biden to enact left wing policies.  A president is a leader of their party, and for a conventional politician like Biden, looking to the party politicians is the first instinct.  

If 60 something senators ask for weed to be legalized across the nation, or universal healthcare, or even  UBI, do you really think Biden will still listen to the companies?  He needs votes far more than he needs money, seeing as much of that money goes to get votes.  But as we’ve seen with Bloomberg, well, money doesn’t really get you there anymore.

Trump's financial records case among them. It seems likely SCOTUS will rule on the cases by end of term (late June-ish).

-----------------------

**TLDR** (tried to pick out the most important stuff, but I consider it all important TBH):

* Democrats are advancing different bills to try to prevent Trump from destroying all Inspector General oversight

* Schiff is investigating Trump's firing of Intel IG Atkinson

* Schiff also introduced legislation to establish a bipartisan commission “to provide a full accounting of the country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic,” similar to the 9/11 commission. 

* The Senate is currently at a stalemate over the next steps to provide coronavirus relief funds to the nation

* Oversight of the CARES Act funds currently being doled out by Mnuchin and Trump is not functional yet

* SCOTUS was asked to rule on TX abortion ban during pandemic

* Wisconsin GOP forced many residents to risk their lives to vote in-person in an important election that included a contentious judicial nomination

* Thousands of ballots in WI were never sent or were not postmarked - will likely not be counted

* Democrats & Republicans are gearing up for a fight over voting-by-mail this November

* Trump promised not to sign coronavirus relief bill if it included money for the Postal Service

* Trump'a family is taking 12 times more protected trips than the Obama family

* Hate crimes against Asian Americans has surged in the US, with approx 100 reported per day

The idea is a reprisal of once-illegal Election Day “ballot security” intimidation tactics, intended to challenge voter registration and remove voters from the rolls. At a strategy session in February attended by conservative donors and activists, several people expressed a specific need for Republican poll watchers in “inner city” and predominantly Native American precincts..."

You're literally saying ""this is actually *100x more deadly than Swine Flu*"" by saying the WHO's estimate is off by a factor of another 10x. That's absolutely *absurd*.



Any of the numbers we see from the WHO or CDC or anyone else right now (yourself very much included) are going to be inaccurate, and not just by a tiny amount, but potentially a lot. It only counts people in hospitals. That's it. That's right there a *huge* bias, and that's neverminding the fact that they're *okay* with a bit more cautionary bias.  

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/

It's not because COVID is weird or new or unknown, it's because we have no legitimate way to find out *really* how many of us have it, have had it, etc. In the most tested country in the world, Iceland, [half of those infected showed zero symptoms whatsoever](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/europe/iceland-testing-coronavirus-intl/index.html). And even that link above says it:


> Importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases.

> As further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available ... the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease.

####...

> But while an epidemic is still ongoing, as it is the case with the current novel coronavirus outbreak, this formula is, **at the very least,** ***""naïve""*** **and can be ""misleading if, at the time of analysis, the outcome is unknown for a non negligible proportion of patients.""** 

These estimates from official sources are already biased to lean towards worse than better. You're saying ""no no it's *10x worse than that*"" and I'm betting you have no experience whatsoever in virology.

2020-04-13,Surur,worldnews,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/g0gib4/iceland_finds_that_half_its_citizens_with/fn9w4sg/,"It is highly questionable whether commercial tests are currently available that can differentiate an infection with the new corona virus from an infection with other seasonal corona viruses. According to the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, coronaviruses are responsible for about a third of all colds in humans.

Four such endemic pathogens also circulate here in the winter half-year. But none of this was explained at the press conference on Thursday morning.

The virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charité also followed this. At an expert discussion organized by the German Science Media Center (SMC) on Thursday afternoon on future test strategies on Sars-CoV-2, Drosten said that he could not derive anything from what was presented in Düsseldorf: ""There is simply so little explained that you don't understand everything. ""

In the evening, Drosten reiterated his biggest criticism in today's journal. One has to differentiate whether it is a matter of diagnoses or simply signals from a laboratory test. ""These laboratory tests have a high rate of false positive signals, purely technical,"" said Drosten.

This means that antibody tests can work even if people have not been infected with the new Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus, but their immune system has made antibodies against one of the four seasonal coronaviruses.

If a test that is supposed to detect Sars-CoV-2 also reacts positively to the antibodies of seasonal coronaviruses, one speaks of cross-reactivity. And since the cold period is only a few weeks ago, tests could erroneously detect these antibodies - so to speak, confuse them.

[You can find current developments on the coronavirus pandemic  here in our news blog . The developments especially in Berlin  at this point. ]

In order to be able to estimate how often the confusion used by the test used by Streeck and his team resulted in confirmation tests in the laboratory, Drosten said. ""At the moment it is not clear whether they were made."" As a scientific community, however, one waits for such information.

If it turned out that cross-reactivity had actually occurred, the conclusions of Streeck's team would be questioned. Because then maybe not 15 percent of the people in Heinsberg would have struggled with the new virus, but some of them could simply have antibodies to the mostly harmless seasonal coronaviruses in the blood. As a result, fewer people would be immune.

Hendrik Streeck reached ""Zeit Online"" in the evening by phone. He said the test used could, of course, with a certain margin of error, distinguish between infection with Sars-CoV-2 and other corona viruses. The Lübeck-based company Euroimmun, which produced the antibody test that was used in the Heinsberg study, had previously checked it on 1,600 sera from blood donors, according to Streeck.

Assuming that maybe five to ten percent of the population had already been infected with corona viruses other than Sars-CoV-2, the procedure should also have found false positive test results. But that is apparently only a very small part of the case, the manufacturer states the specificity with more than 99 percent.

That would mean that in less than one percent of the cases, the test used shows a false positive result. However, this statement cannot be verified without specific data from Euroimmun.

As part of the development of their own antibody test, an international research group led by Christian Drosten also checked prototypes of the antibody test from the company Euroimmun (MedRxiv: Okba et al., 2020). To this end, the scientists examined sera from people who could not have been infected with the current Sars-CoV-2, since their samples come from a time before the outbreak.

In fact, in some cases the tests responded to antibodies from seasonal cold viruses from the Corona family. The researchers used the test again on twelve serum samples from the blood of two patients who apparently had such a seasonal infection. Again he reacted to the antibodies. And these are not antibodies against Sars-CoV-2.

This very small check contradicts Streeck's statement that cross-reactivity - i.e. that the test also reacts to antibodies from seasonal corona viruses - hardly plays a role in the Heinsberg study. To what extent the Euroimmun test in the study by the Bonn working group had already developed to such an extent that this cross-reactivity could be reduced or even ruled out is currently no data available.

Tragic at the loss of human life and obviously sympathy to their families. Even today, 8 years later, it must be very difficult.

Since then, there have been 10 investigations into it - six of which have been lead by Republican-lead committees.

All in all this lead to the conclusion that **not one** high-ranking Obama administration official had acted improperly - including President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice. Four career State Department officials were criticized for denying requests for additional security at the facility prior to the attack. Eric Boswell, the Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security, resigned under pressure, while three others were suspended.  In her role as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton subsequently took responsibility for the security lapses.

4 American Lives. 10 investigations from 2012 to 2016.

Fast Forward to 2020.

Regardless of who is president while this pandemic sweeps the world there is going to be the loss of human life - that's a fact. It wouldn't be labeled as a pandemic otherwise. 

The important questions to keep asking is ""How many is acceptable?, Who knew what, when?, What were their actions?, What were their in-actions?, Who is responsible?""

Specifically looking to the USS Roosevelt : Who knew what, when? and What actions were taken?

So far, one American Soldier on the USS Roosevelt has lost his life - may he find peace. 550 sailors aboard that ship are/have been infected, including the Captain who lost his command pleading for help.

How many more US sailors are going to die?

Now let's back it out a little bit:

We are all getting pretty familiar with the timeline with our Government's response to this pandemic - and the raw data ----- the FACTS --- are looking pretty damning. 

Two days after the passengers were evacuated from the Princess Cruise ship on February 16 in Japan, on Feb. 18, PM Shinzo Abe imposed national [NPIs](https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/index.html) in Japan: This is the date that their government took definable action.

As of today they are sitting on 7370 TOTAL INFECTIONS and 123 TOTAL DEATHS. The population of Japan is roughly 1/3 that of the USA and their land mass is 26 times smaller than that of the USA. If this virus is spread via human to human contact, simple math would lead us to believe that Japan, as a whole, should be more contagious than the US --- just given population density alone.

This has obviously not been the case.

In contrast, let's ask ""What similar actionable NPI mitigation efforts did The Executive Branch of the Trump Administration do in response to the Feb 16 evacuation date?"" ([The vast majority of the agencies responsible for Emergency Preparedness & Responses in the US fall under the head of the Executive Branch](https://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/c.php?g=364692&p=2463714)). All of which are, of course supposed to be steered by the President of the United States. Ultimately - despite what POTUS may say contrary to this - National Mitigation efforts are his responsibility.

By design --- this branch is supposed to be able to react quickly and efficiently in these circumstances. They DID not. [Snopes timeline here](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/timeline-trump-covid19-responses/) and [Politifact](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/mar/20/how-donald-trump-responded-coronavirus-pandemic/) timeline here. For whatever reason, we did not have any Nationwide NPI efforts issued until the CDC declared a National Emergency on March 13 - nearly a month after the first known human to human cases outside of China had been confirmed. 

Nearly. One. Month. Later.

Our numbers, particularly in contrast to Japan's, give us a big clue as to the depth to which human life could have preserved if action would have been taken sooner. As I write this, 564,317 US infections, 22,850 US deaths.  

This is the Trump Administration's Benghazi; on steroids: on a level that is exponentially larger and infinitely more tragic and more harmful to the security of this nation.

When the dust settles from all of this, may we have the courage to demand responsibility and hold those who have failed accountable for this tragic loss of human life and capital.

Absolutely. The Florida government has responded terribly to this. Almost no response, really.

A couple weeks ago a good friend of mine died from what was almost certainly coronavirus. She was an ER nurse, age 43.

She was one of the healthiest people I have ever met, in great shape physically, took very good care of herself, careful about diet and nutrition. A model of health.

She died and her death was classed as congestive heart failure with double lung pneumonia. It is unclear whether she is or will be counted as a COVID death because she was never tested. And she never had proper protective gear. It worried her greatly as all this became widespread. And killed her ultimately.

No funeral. Not for her or the several other people we know who are in ICU, should they die. The best we can do, and are planning for, is a memorial for all of them once this emergency passes.

Florida really, really fucked this up. And the storm of deaths over the next few weeks will probably be staggering.

No excuse or reason can suffice to answer for what truly is criminal neglect or homicide.

It is horrifying."

An evangelical pastor died of COVID-19 just weeks after proudly showing off how packed his Virginia church was — and vowing to keep preaching “unless I’m in jail or the hospital.”
In his last known in-person service on March 22, Bishop Gerald O. Glenn got his congregation at Richmond’s New Deliverance Evangelistic Church to stand to prove how many were there despite warnings against gatherings of more than 10 people.

“I firmly believe that God is larger than this dreaded virus. You can quote me on that,” he said, repeating it a second time to claps, saying that “people are healed” in his church.

Happily announcing he was being “controversial” by being “in violation” of safety protocols — with “way more than 10 people” at the church — he vowed to keep his church open “unless I’m in jail or the hospital.”

“I am essential,” he said of remaining open, saying, “I’m a preacher — I talk to God!”

On Sunday, his church announced “with an exceedingly sorrowful and heavy heart” that the pastor had died a week after being diagnosed with COVID-19.

His wife, Marcietia Glenn, is also sick with the bug, with church members offering their prayers.

Their daughter, Mar-Gerie Crawley, told WTVR that her father initially dismissed his symptoms because he has a condition that often leads to fevers and infections.

She is now urging everyone to stay home.

“It becomes very real to you,” she told WTVR after her parents’ diagnoses.

“I just beg people to understand the severity and the seriousness of this, because people are saying it’s not just about us, it’s about everyone around us.”"

>Q: ...I asked whether it was possible for her on behalf of the government to give a commitment to a date by when deliveries of PPE would match what’s needed on the front line. Because every day we get messages from health care workers and others saying they simply don’t have what’s needed.

>Q: ....Will you apologize to the nurses and indeed the other medical and health care workers who are being put in that impossible position of having to make a decision between whether to offer treatment to a patient or to protect their own personal safety?


>Q: You paint a relatively positive picture of where we are at the moment, but there is a very different picture being painted within our care and nursing homes. ... The care sector is watching this right now and is desperate for you to tell them that they will get regular tests so they can end this lottery. Can you give that guarantee to them?


>Q: Do you have updated figures on the number of NHS workers who have died after getting coronavirus and what are you doing to establish the reasons why?

>Q: I wanted to ask on the prime minister, if you know if he’s been given advice and how long he should rest for before he returns to work?


>Q: You’ve talked about a reduction in the time that it’s taken to get PPE to those places that need it down to two and a half days. I wanted to ask you if that is an acceptable time during which the NHS staff that you’ve just praised will be putting themselves in harm’s way while treating patients?

>Q: Sir Patrick Vallance, was happy to go on record last month to say the 20,000 deaths or fewer would be in his words, “A good outcome for the UK.” Given that we’ve now hit 10,000, can we still achieve that good outcome?

I think the weekend family bowling was a departure from the norm (probably due to holiday/birthday weekend) and that’s why Jenna was quick to jump on posting about the family activity that they did as a family of four with the whole family participating."

“With regards to recovery and then re-infection, I believe we do not have the answers to that. That is an unknown,” Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies programs, said at a press conference at the organization’s Geneva headquarters on Monday. 


A preliminary study of patients in Shanghai found that some patients had “no detectable antibody response” while others had a very high response, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s lead scientist on Covid-19. Whether the patients that had a strong antibody response were immune to a second infection is “a separate question,” she added.

More than 300,000 of the 1.87 million coronavirus cases across the world have recovered, WHO officials noted, adding that they need more data from recovered patients to understand their antibody response, whether that gives them immunity and for how long. 

“That’s something that we really need to better understand is what does that antibody response look like in terms of immunity,” Van Kerkhove said.

Ryan said there are questions about whether the virus can reactivate after a patient recovers and tests negative for Covid-19.

“There are many reasons why we might see reactivation of infection either with the same infection or another infectious agent,” he said. In general, “there are many situations in viral infection where someone doesn’t clear the virus entirely from there system.” Some patients can also clear the main infection but develop a secondary bacterial infection,  he said."

They can’t even count. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes.
One of my people came up to me and said, “Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.” That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. **And this is their new hoax.** But we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early, we could have had a lot more than that. We’re doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified. We are so unified. The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now. There has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now. Never been a movement. So a statistic that we want to talk about, go ahead. Say USA. It’s okay. USA. So a number that nobody heard of, that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? 35,000, that’s a lot of people. It could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000. They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die. And so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn’t mean we won’t and we are totally prepared. It doesn’t mean we won’t, but think of it. **You hear 35 and 40,000 people and we’ve lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode.**

>WASHINGTON — The captain had reached a breaking point.

>The aircraft carrier he commanded, the Theodore Roosevelt, was docked in Guam as the coronavirus raced unchecked through its narrow corridors. The warship’s doctors estimated that more than 50 crew members would die, but Capt. Brett E. Crozier’s superiors were balking at what they considered his drastic request to evacuate nearly the entire ship.

>Captain Crozier was haunted by the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship of 2,600 passengers in individual cabins where the virus had killed eight people and infected more than 700. The situation on his ship had the potential to be far worse: nearly 5,000 sailors crammed in shared berths, sometimes stacked three high. Eight of his sailors with severe Covid-19 symptoms had already been evacuated to the Navy’s hospital in Guam.

>On March 30, after four days of rebuffs from his superiors, Captain Crozier sat down to compose an email. “Sailors don’t need to die,” he wrote to 20 other people, all Navy personnel in the Pacific, asking for help. A Naval Academy graduate with nearly 30 years of military service, the captain knew the email would most likely end his career, his friends said in interviews. The military prizes its chain of command, and the appropriate course would have been for the captain to continue to push his superiors for action.

>He hit “send” anyway.

>Three weeks later, the fired captain is battling the coronavirus himself, 584 other crew members have tested positive and the acting Navy secretary has resigned. The secretary, Thomas B. Modly, removed the captain because he thought that was what President Trump wanted, officials said. Mr. Modly, the officials said, was keenly aware that his predecessor in the job had been fired after tangling with Mr. Trump. But in trying to please the president, Mr. Modly miscalculated and destroyed his own career.

>The story of the Theodore Roosevelt encapsulates, aboard a single aircraft carrier, Mr. Trump’s tumultuous three and a half years as commander in chief. The episode shows how the military, the most structured and hierarchical part of the government, has tried to adjust to an erratic president, and how in a hollowed-out leadership, acting secretaries have replaced those confirmed by the Senate.

>A Navy investigation into the episode is expected to be made public this week.

>This article is based on interviews with two dozen current and former Navy and Defense Department civilian and uniformed personnel, including Roosevelt crew members. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential meetings and discussions.

>Sailors aboard the Roosevelt most likely picked up the virus at a port call in Da Nang, Vietnam, on March 5 — just the second visit by an American aircraft carrier to that country since the end of the Vietnam War.

>At the time, 16 coronavirus cases had been reported in Vietnam, all in the northern part of the country, far from Da Nang. The top Navy officer in the Pacific, Adm. Philip S. Davidson, ordered the long-scheduled visit to proceed as an important show of American military strength in a region increasingly unnerved by Beijing’s growing territorial claims in the South China Sea.

>Da Nang’s piers are too small for a ship of the Roosevelt’s size to dock. So for its brief port call, it anchored offshore, relying on small boats to ferry the crew to the docks. Crew members posted pictures to social media of rooftop hotel pools and relaxation. One post said, “feelin vietnamazing.”

>On the fourth and final day in Da Nang, after dozens of sailors had spent at least one night in a hotel where two British nationals tested positive for the virus, the Roosevelt ordered some crew members back to the ship for fear they might be exposed. Those who had stayed at the hotel were immediately isolated.

>The Roosevelt went back out to sea, and its medical team watched closely for any sign of sickened sailors — a ticking clock during the 14-day period when symptoms would most likely appear. Over those same 14 days, aircraft flew on and off the ship, bringing in supplies from Japan and the Philippines.

>Then came the announcement over the shipwide loudspeakers at dawn on March 24 as the carrier steamed through the western Pacific. “Set River City 1,” a voice ordered.

>The sailors knew something had happened. River City means Reduced Communications — no internet access or phone calls for most of the crew.

>Soon after, sailors posted outside the massive ship’s medical bays turned away crew members for anything that was not an emergency. Soon everyone knew: Three sailors had tested positive for the virus. The outbreak started in the reactor department, with its crew members responsible for running the very heart of the ship: the nuclear reactors.

>The three were flown from the ship to a Navy hospital in Guam. Two days later, on March 26, the Roosevelt docked in Guam. Covid-19 testing began for the entire crew.

>The argument between Captain Crozier and his superior aboard the ship, Rear Adm. Stuart P. Baker, began. The Navy high command, including Mr. Modly, was also on alert back in Washington.

>Captain Crozier argued for evacuating nearly the entire crew. He wanted them quarantined and tested while the ship was professionally cleaned. A skeleton crew of 500 would remain aboard to operate the ship’s nuclear reactors, safeguard bombs and missiles and warplanes, and perform other essential duties.

>Admiral Baker, who as commander of the carrier strike group oversees the Roosevelt and seven other ships, countered that less drastic measures would still protect the crew and leave the Roosevelt in operation. Mr. Modly and residents of Guam also expressed concerns that the island could not house all of the carrier’s crew if the order was given to evacuate, in particular if a growing number tested positive.

>The Navy considered alternatives, including sending the Roosevelt to Okinawa, Japan, or to San Diego. Another option was to leave 4,000 sailors aboard the ship and 1,000 in a base gymnasium on Guam, where they would sleep on cots several feet apart. But a first attempt at housing some of the crew at the gym quickly resulted in more cases of the virus.

>Back in Washington, Mr. Modly directed a top aide to contact Captain Crozier to ensure he was getting what he needed. The aide, Mr. Modly said later, reported that the captain was satisfied, “only asking that he wished the crew could be evacuated faster.”

>But at this point, Captain Crozier was composing a four-page letter to be sent by unclassified email. In the recipient line, the header was bland: REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

>The contents of the letter were not.

>“There are two end states T.R. could achieve,” Captain Crozier wrote. “We go to war with the force we have and fight sick.” In that situation, he wrote, “there will be losses to the virus.” Or, he wrote, the ship could try to “achieve a COVID-free T.R.,” with all the necessary evacuation.

>“As war is not imminent, we recommend pursuing the peace time end state,” Captain Crozier wrote. He showed the email to a handful of the most senior officers on the ship. They told him they wanted to sign it, too. Captain Crozier, fearing for their careers, told them no.

>Captain Crozier’s letter ran headlong into the administration’s narrative that it had everything under control.

>The next day, March 31, as Mr. Modly arrived in Los Angeles to visit the Navy hospital ship Mercy, an aide had some news for him. A copy of Captain Crozier’s letter, which had not been sent to Mr. Modly, had found its way to The San Francisco Chronicle presumably leaked by one of the 20 recipients. The letter was spreading rapidly to other news outlets as well.

>Mr. Modly was furious, although he restrained himself on a conference call with reporters the next day. “It’s disappointing to have him say that,” he told the reporters. “We’re doing everything we can.”

>Worried that Captain Crozier’s letter would anger Mr. Trump, Mr. Modly called colleagues asking for advice, officials said. Should he fire Captain Crozier? Most of them, including Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told him he should order an investigation into the incident and wait and see the outcome.

>But Mr. Modly, a Naval Academy graduate and former Navy helicopter pilot who was hoping to become the permanent Navy secretary, was still worried about what the president wanted, officials said. Mr. Modly’s predecessor, Richard V. Spencer, was fired for opposing the president’s intervention in support of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL charged with war crimes who became a darling of Mr. Trump.

>During a phone conversation with one adviser, Mr. Modly suddenly interrupted and said, according to a person familiar with the discussion, “Oh, breaking, the president wants him fired.” The person surmised that Mr. Modly had received a text message informing him of the president’s views."

By February 14, well before the carrier arrived in Vietnam, the Navy ordered all ships in the Indo-Pacific region that had made port calls to quarantine at sea for at least 14 days, the maximum incubation period for the novel coronavirus.

What's horrifying is thinking of regular American Democrats, who aren't being bribed or threatened by anyone, talking like this, when the general election opponent will be Trump.

I really preferred any other candidate but Sanders to Biden. I liked Williamson better than I like Biden.

But Biden (and I know I'm preaching to the converted, but I have to post this so I don't explode) is a fundamentally decent, well-meaning, hard-working guy who will do his best to campaign and govern in an honorable way.

At this point, for anyone other than, maybe, the most fervent, sincere anti-abortion people, anything short of supporting Biden with our lives, our liberty and our sacred honor is pure treason.

An important note buried in the middle of the article. Selection bias might be at play here - that is, since ventilator shortages have been seen around the world it’s likely that only the most severe patients are being put on ventilators in the first place. Meaning the people being put on ventilators now were already closer to death than people who were put on ventilators pre-coronavirus. 

With that being said, ventilators do damage lungs in most cases and there may be some novel component of the virus that exacerbates this damage. Either way, it’s smart to keep as many people off of ventilators as much as possible for multiple reasons."

With current daily rate of Coronavirus deaths, would easily surpass every other single cause of death in the USA.  And that is *with* social distancing measures we have in place.  The 60,000 deaths Dr. Fauci forecasts as the current ""optimistic"" case, assuming continued social distancing, is still more than other influenza and pneumonia deaths, and this is *in addition* to the ""normal"" yearly deaths from those illnesses.

And then there is the exponential growth of deaths that would occur without any social deaths, but good luck explaining exponential growth to anyone arguing deaths from Coronavirus are no big deal."

Todd S. Purdum (The Atlantic)

&#x200B;

>It was by far the largest enterprise Joe Biden had ever led: a nearly $800 billion government-spending program intended to rescue the country from the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. It involved more than 100,000 projects—275 programs within 28 federal agencies. “If we do everything right, there’s still a 30 percent chance we’re going to get it wrong,” Biden himself said at the time.  
>  
>But in overseeing the 2009 Recovery Act as Barack Obama’s vice president, Biden shepherded an effort now seen as an effective and remarkably fraud-free response to the financial crisis, even if it won little praise or political credit at the time. If Biden has the good—or bad—luck to win the presidency in November, his first task will be to perform an encore on an even more daunting scale.  
>  
>It wasn’t a glamorous job, involving as it did minding hundreds of minor details and scores of bureaucracies, and some public officials doubtless would have found it boring. But it was the kind of close work that’s required for good management in any crisis, and Biden seemed to take to it with an enthusiasm that those who were there in the trenches with him recall with pride.  
>  
>“He would be the most battle-tested president to come into office that we’ve ever had in this regard,” said Biden’s longtime economic adviser Jared Bernstein, a progressive expert on income inequality who would doubtless have a role in a Biden administration. “FDR did amazing work on the Great Depression, but he was throwing noodles at the wall. Biden would bring a unique experience to the office, having been the implementer in chief last time.”  
>  
>Indeed, the story of how a longtime legislator, who had never run anything larger than a Senate committee staff, managed to marshal a government-wide campaign may offer a preview of how a President Biden would approach the coronavirus pandemic, and the global economic contraction it has already spawned. Paradoxically, though, it’s a story that’s hard for the presumptive Democratic nominee to share with voters at the moment, because he, like so many Americans, is stuck at home.  
>  
>“What I found was you have to manage it every single day,” Biden said during a recent CNN town hall, after he was asked what his experience handling the recovery had taught him about the qualities needed in a president in times of crisis. “And so it’s about management. It’s about day to day to day. And I give you my word that for the better part of that 18 months, I was literally on the phone at least three to four hours a day with my team, talking about the detailed implementation. How do we get the money? What do we do? Who do we go to? Who do we ask for?”  
>  
>To the degree that there was criticism of Biden’s management of the Recovery Act—and there was some—it mirrored the current critique of the former vice president’s pragmatic brand of politics. Critics on the left faulted him and Obama for not making the stimulus package bigger (though keeping it below $1 trillion was the price of winning necessary Republican votes for its passage in the Senate). Republicans attacked the administration for defaulting to Democratic priorities and not working harder to win GOP support.  
>  
>“The stimulus represented the original sin of the Obama administration to congressional Republicans,” said Michael Steel, who was then a senior aide to the House Republican leader, John Boehner. “It set the tone for the next eight years. House Republicans would have been pretty cheap dates—and it wouldn’t have taken that much to get a fair number of moderates on board—if the White House had reached out more.”  
>  
>The Democratic viewpoint is precisely the opposite. For Biden and the Obama White House, the House GOP’s lockstep opposition to the plan—before Obama even made his first trip to Capitol Hill to press for it—was what set the tone for the next eight years. In this version of the story, Biden’s successful lobbying of three Senate Republicans—Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania—made possible the passage of any program at all.  
>  
>“We needed three Republican votes, and he went and he got the three Republican votes,” recalled Ron Klain, then Biden’s chief of staff and now a campaign adviser. “People say, ‘It was a different time, and he couldn’t do that again.’ But a lot of people said he couldn’t do it back in 2009.”  
>  
>In January of that year, the month Obama took office, the country lost some 800,000 jobs, as unemployment edged toward 8 percent. That capped the worst three months of jobs numbers since defense factories ceased operating at the end of World War II. The stimulus that Obama proposed was a mix of tax cuts, tax credits for business, aid to state and local governments, an expansion of food stamps, and a raft of infrastructure programs.  
>  
>In his memoir, *Believer*, Obama’s chief strategist David Axelrod conceded that “to a cynical public, it looked less like ‘Change We Can Believe In’ than ‘Dollars We Can’t Afford,’ which was another way of saying business as usual.” But from the beginning, Obama White House veterans recall, the president told staff that the program should be run as efficiently as possible. Biden drafted a memo outlining how he thought the project should be managed and presented it to Obama over lunch in February 2009. As the author Michael Grunwald recounts in his admiring 2012 history of the Recovery Act, *The New New Deal*, Obama scanned the memo, flipped it back across the table to Biden, and said, “Great, do it.”  
>  
>“He wanted me to be the bastard at the family picnic,” Biden would later say, “which, politely, I am.”"

Real distopian things that could (are likely to) happen:

\- Blue states do more vote-by-mail and other things to bolster turnout in the Corona age.  Turnout stays the same or goes up in blue states.

\- Red states drag their feet or do the opposite (eg Wisconsin primary).  Turnout goes down in red states.

\- Biden wins the popular vote by many millions, but loses the electoral college

\- Lots of stories about disenfranchisement, people are super pissed

\>>>>> Social unrest or constitutional crisis

Ezra Klein also talks about the increasing gap between the popular vote and electoral college and how unsustainable that is.  Could destroy trust in the legitimacy of our federal government.  Coronavirus may lead us to a pretty dark place much faster than we expected.

THEY DIDN’T SHOW THAT THERE WAS ANY VIABLE VIRUS AT THAT DISTANCE FOR ANY MEANINGFUL TIME.

All they showed was that some of the viral GENOME was found farther away, and they conveniently didn’t do any actual viral proliferation studies to see if the virus was still enveloped and competent to penetrate cells and replicate. Similarly, when you see a study saying that “cOrOnAvIrUs iS iN tHe AiR fOr 4 hOuRs,” again, to my knowledge, none of those studies have shown the existence of infectious viral particles, let alone infectious doses — only genomic material.

For all the non-scientists here, here’s a tip on reading about science: fuck the news media. They’re not scientists, at best they’re educated in journalism or some similar field. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve read articles where the journalists misinterpret the paper to say something RADICALLY different from what the authors intended. Read the paper itself, they’re mostly all open access for coronavirus. When you’re reading the paper, there are three initial steps:
1) read the abstract
2) read the methods
3) use your brain and evaluate whether the methods used can possibly be sufficient to support claims made in the abstract.

Once you’ve done that, go ahead and read the paper if it passes that first test (edit to add: and make sure that the results actually DO justify the claims). If you don’t do that, you’re going to be passing around a ton of junk “science” and spreading inaccurate (and usually alarmist) information.

This is a serious enough situation; there’s no need to make it worse by spreading fake news."

Here is hoping, cause that would be nice. Some other strangeness this time around too. There were a large number of cases that appeared in the 40+ group this time around. Shifted the percentages a bit. The City of Austin [added some new stats](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/39e4f8d4acb0433baae6d15a931fa984), including ICU patients and those on ventilators. This is very helpful, and shout out to those at the City advocating for more data being supplied to the public. I know you are out there.

First, let me note the many limitations we are still dealing with that make this data potentially hard to form opinions with:

* We do not have information on the rate of testing or duration of time it takes to get results.
* We do not have testing kit criteria being used.
* Addition of spring breakers at an unknown time to the data.
* No information on how soon the spring breakers, and those exposed to them, were notified and quarantined.
* The list can really go on forever; we can always use more information and more transparency.

There are 93 people hospitalized in the 5 county MSA (metropolitan statistics area) that are confirmed COVID-19 cases. 49 (+7) of those  are in the ICU and 23 (-9) are on ventilators. Out of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, the county reports that 144 have recovered. Up 4 from the day before. I'll be looking to include this data in my graphics as soon as we have more data points to work with.

The average daily rate of change since we crossed 100 cases is 11.7%. That is 10 days of continuing to flatten the curve. Yes, it still is flattening even with today's bump because the average rate of change is still being dragged down. Good job Austin! Today’s rate of change is 10.6%.  The bump today could be the weekend drag coming in a little early, or we could be seeing the 2nd tier effects of the spring breakers start to appear in the data. Speculation at this point.

Lastly, the death toll increased to 11.

Make sure to reach out to our elected officials and let them KNOW that we want testing. We want aggressive testing, and we want it now. You can [**GO HERE**](https://www.austintexas.gov/contact-us) and find contact information for you district council member. I highly recommend contacting them. The message shouldn't be that we need more information about testing, it should be that testing is one of the most impactful things that we can do. It needs to be aggressive, and widespread. All healthcare workers should be tested routinely. Symptoms or not. Front line workers should be tested routinely. Beyond that we should be testing as many people as possible.

Be safe Austin. Take care of each other.

Also, thank you to everyone giving me gold and platinum. It means the world that you find this helpful. Please use that money and donate to a cause that can help the people in our city. I don't need it. Thank you for the support!

Dr. Fauci (the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) is part of the White House's coronavirus task force but [he's been in the game for a long, long time](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-anthony-fauci-became-americas-doctor) across multiple administrations. He also hasn't been shy about correcting Trump in front of the press. From the link:

> At seventy-nine, Fauci has run the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for thirty-six years, through six Administrations and a long procession of viral epidemics: H.I.V., sars, avian influenza, swine flu, Zika, and Ebola among them. As a member of the Administration’s coronavirus task force, Fauci seemed to believe that the government’s actions could be directed, even if the President’s pronouncements could not. At White House briefings, it has regularly fallen to Fauci to gently amend Trump’s absurdities, half-truths, and outright lies. No, there is no evidence that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine will provide a “miracle” treatment to stave off the infection. No, there won’t be a vaccine for at least a year. When the President insisted for many weeks on denying the government’s inability to deliver test kits for the virus, Fauci, testifying before Congress, put the matter bluntly. “That’s a failing,” he said. “Let’s admit it.”

His candid approach has made a lot of fans and has made him the 'face' of the White House's coronavirus response. On the other hand, he also has critics, [notably from the far right](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/anthony-fauci-fringe-maga-target-147401) and has even [received death threats requiring additional security to be assigned to him](https://www.foxnews.com/us/fauci-coronavirus-expert-security-protective-detail-death-threats)."

And before some stupid cunt jumps in here assuming I believe surgical masks and homemade masks protect the wearer from contracting the virus: no! They do offer more protection than wearing no mask of course but their main use is that they prevent the wearer from spreading droplets and aerosols accidentally and unknowingly while out in public. Since asymptomatic people can be infectious, and it's not realistic to test everyone all the time, the easiest solution is to simply behave as if everyone has the virus and require them to wear masks.

Combined, they produce roughly enough food to provide 8 oz of beef to roughly 1/3 - 1/2 of Canada every day (obviously much of that is exported).

There seems to be an attitude that we can all go home and come out two weeks later and everything will be fine. We're on roughly week four of a shut down and yes, governments have provided money that they've borrowed to give to tide us over.

But governments do not have the same ability to do this with food. I fully respect that we'd love to give PPE to all these workers, and I would believe that management at the plant is likely working on plans to do so. Unfortunately, we are in a global shortage of PPE and most PPE is being directed to health care workers.

We can all live a little longer with borrowed money, but if we shut down all food production, we will have a bigger problem than coronavirus."

I would hope that people are staying up to date with the news, including the unemployment data. IIRC over a million of us are unemployed now. I saw a [chart](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/11/business/economy/coronavirus-us-economy-spending.html) and it says shopping is down, including beauty items which is down by 50%. 

I think that that chart and information is important, even the statistic about fast fashion, because the market is SO oversaturated. Clothing stores are having ridiculous sales right now (Old Navy has like $1 clearance) just to try to boost sales anyway they can. I work retail at a large chain, we are not doing too well. Remember when ABH was having like 10 new launches a month? Some beauty fans and collectors simply just can’t afford to be making these sort of purchases right now. 

I like the influx of shop my stash videos, but I think most people miss living our “normal lives”. My mom and I were talking about this today. We keep saying how much we miss the simple drive to work and how we won’t complain about going to work anymore. That’s a lie lol. It’s just not how humans work. I have a feeling as soon as the CDC or WHO gives the okay for business’ to re-open, it’s going to be hectic for the first few weeks. Some people on temporary lay off will go back to work, be making money, and the spending cycle continues. 

People shop. A lot. I handle returns for my job. People come in with bags and bags and bags of literal garbage to return. Scalp massagers. Panda chip clips. Salt lamps. Impulse purchases. Taking this into consideration, some brands may take advantage and begin launching products at a faster rate again. 

This is a long comment, your post just got me thinking. I think influencers will survive, but I also think this may show who has made the right financial decisions and maybe who didn’t. It’s absolutely none if my business and of course, who knows peoples situations, but I know we have all seen influencers living in literal mansions with multiple sports cars and like $1,000,000 worth of handbags.

Victor Davis Hanson is a military historian who works for the conservative think thank the Hoover Institution. He has no medical background whatsoever. He has also written many think pieces in conservative publications calling for the lockdown to end and the economy to reopen. He does have an affiliation with Stanford, but he is not a doctor or scientists and he is not involved in Stanford’s serological study in any way, shape or form. 

Victor gave a quote to local news media that the Stanford study would prove his theory that the virus was here in the fall and that California’s infection rate is low because there is already herd immunity in Cali. Local news media presented this in such a way that it made it seem like Stanford Medicine was doing this study to prove this theory and that it was their theory. Not true. 

Slate has an article walking through all of this. 

https://slate.com/technology/2020/04/coronavirus-circulating-california-2019-bunk.html

So if you are expecting the Stanford study to answer the question of when the virus arrived in California, you are going to be disappointed.  That isn’t the purpose of the study. 

Now, it might very well tell us a larger percentage of the population have the virus than previously thought. But, that will likely be because of asymptomatic cases, false negative antibody tests, or of people not getting tested.   

There is no actual scientific evidence they the virus was here last fall and the Stanford study isn’t going to tell us whether or not the virus was here last fall."

You are being a dimwit. Stop being a dimwit. The WHO started publishing situation reports with threat levels in mid January. It's all there on the website. Threat level ""high"". That's a stark warning, they don't do that often. 

The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on Jan 30. They began sending out increasingly frantic warnings to the international community and press starting in late January. 

These warnings were largely ignored, famously, by the ""it's just the flu"" crowd in government. The ""it's a hoax"" crowd, etc.

If you want to see how stark and urgent the warnings were, go to the WHO website's situation reports here, https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports

So as we all know the Coronavirus has led to some.... less then savory reactions on the internet. It’s like the Wild West on here. Conspiracies everywhere, people acting like fools, completely absurd predictions being thrown out, etc. The sky has been falling for a solid month and a half now. 

Well I thought I’d make a list of all the bullshit Reddit(cough r/Coronavirus cough) has spout to show y’all just how unreliable it is.

1. *There will be over 2.2 million dead in America!* Well actually it’s gonna be around 60,000. No worse then a flu season. That’s not saying this is better then the flu. It’s not. It undeniably more contagious. BUT that number is a far cry from the BS predicted on here. Now it’s this low due to precautions, but I was seeing millions dead as a theory even after the precautions were taken.

2. *We’re going to be locked down for 18 months!* Guys. That is laughable. You guys *seriously* believe that? Hell they’re discussing how to gradually reopen right now! Also we could have a vaccine by fall. So there’s that. Even if we don’t, at the rate this is going, we could easily have at least a fraction of normalcy back within a month and a half.

3. *This is only the beginning!* Well apparently it’s been the beginning for nearly two months now. 

4. *Society will collapse!* Okay so this thing is gonna kill about as much as a regular sickness does per year and that’s what’s gonna make society collapse? Get real. 

5. *Young people are dying left and right!* Bullshit. The news is reporting EVERY outlier possible. Every single person in the 0.1% is being reported. Also most have been proven to have health conditions or died to reasons nearly completely unrelated to their Coronavirus.

6. *We will run out of food!* Food companies are working as hard as they ever have and are making some of the most money they have, at least a good bit are. They ain’t closing. Plus animals and plants aren’t just gonna magically disappear cmon now.

7. *Bodies will be piling on the streets!* The hell is this The Walking Dead?! GET REAL!!! If that many people were dead(which not even close to that many are) they wouldn’t pile them in the streets.

8. *The virus will mutate!* Actually it’s been proven this virus mutates slower then most and most believe one vaccine maybe enough to get rid of it forever, at least a lot.

9. *Exponential growth!* Well we’re moving right as predicted to around 60,000 deaths. That’s a lot mind you, but hardly exponential growth. Stop just quoting stuff you heard in 10th grade history class.

10. *This is the apocalypse!* Ho boy. I’m not even giving this one the time of day.

11. *We’re going to have a Great Depression!* We’re nowhere close to that. We have a high unemployment rate BUT the stock market isn’t crashing. This is just a stupid theory doomers have latched onto cause most of their theories have been wrong so far.

12. *Second Wave!* If it comes we’ll be much much much more prepared. This is another theory they’re latching onto since their other BS hasn’t come true.

So yeah guys. So so so so so many “predictions” the doomers have had are wrong. So let it be known, they probably won’t be right about much going forward either. Still stay alert and stay safe though!"

So no, it's not on track for ""flu like"" numbers. If we're lucky, if we're really lucky we'll be able to keep it below the high end of 61,000 but that's after making huge sacrifices. I'm deployed right now and seeing healthy guys crumble to this. Thank god we haven't had any deaths, but it's not ""the flu"" or anything like that.

On a deployment I've watched guys work through the flu, nobody is working through this."

2020-04-13,S_Nitsche,sweden,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/g0aray/megatråd_coronavirus_20200413/fnagrin/,"Jag är än så länge av åsikten att FHM-strategin nog är rätt (även om det lär vara ett extremt fall av ""det får tiden utvisa""). Jag har dock ett problem med en del som kritiserar strategin. Det känns många gånger väldigt substanslöst, vilket får iaf mig att ifrågasätta motivationen. Här är ett exempel från en debatt-artikel i Aftonbladet: ""[Sverige gör stora fel i kampen mot corona](https://www.aftonbladet.se/debatt/a/awQ01O/sverige-gor-stora-fel-i-kampen-mot-corona)""

&#x200B;

>Det är faktiskt en hel del som är uppenbart.

Vad som är uppenbart framgår dock inte riktigt av artikeln som jag kan se det.

&#x200B;

>Det räcker nämligen att gå tillbaka och läsa tidigare intervjuer för att konstatera att myndigheterna sedan början av februari har gjort ett antal missbedömningar.  
>  
>Alla kan naturligtvis ha fel när det gäller att förutsäga utvecklingen av något så oberäkneligt som en pandemi, men som vid alla misstag är det oerhört viktigt att inte låsa sig vid tidigare uppfattningar och i stället tänka nytt när nya fakta kommer på bordet.  
>  
>Om man hade gjort det hade vi idag inte haft brist på testmöjligheter och skyddsutrustning.

Vilka är dessa missbedömningar? Jag vet att det gjorts en del uttalanden kring situationen men det brukar vara ""enligt nuvarande data/forskning"", ""vi hoppas"" etc. Man har därefter ändrat råd när ny forskning har tillkommit, man justerar modeller allt eftersom data kommer in osv. Är inte det motsatsen till att vara låst? Om vi fortfarande ligger inom det spann som beräknats (jag vet att Norrbotten i stort sett gör det) så kan förstå varför de inte ser någon poäng att göra någon enorm förändring. Hade ett exempel verkligen varit för mycket begärt?

Sedan förstår jag verkligen inte hur ""nya banor"" skulle kunna åtgärda materialbrist och testmöjligheter (av och till har det väl varit samma sak). Känns som om det hade varit bra att ha med en förklaring kring hur det faktiskt skulle gått till i artikeln.

&#x200B;

>Ett annat exempel på denna låsning är att det i dag är ett etablerat faktum att smittspridning kan ske även när man är symtomfri (se till exempel ECDC:s [uttalande](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/RRA-seventh-update-Outbreak-of-coronavirus-disease-COVID-19.pdf).

Jag försökte läsa den men ska ärligt erkänna att jag inte hade fokus nog för att ta mig igenom. Men av det jag kunde få fram så verkade det inte stå 100% fastställt hur det faktiskt påverkar egentligen.

*""Major uncertainties remain with regard to the influence of pre-symptomatic transmission on the overall transmission dynamics of the pandemic because the evidence on transmission from asymptomatic cases from case reports is suboptimal.""*

Den pratar också en del om pre-symptomatiska och även där är det inte glasklart

*""Pre-symptomatic transmission hasalsobeen inferred through modelling, and the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was estimated between48% and 62% \[34\]. Pre-symptomatic transmission was deemed likely based on a shorter serial interval of COVID-19 (4.0 to 4.6 days) than the mean incubation period (five days).""*

Helt ärligt, jag är inte säker på att jag fattar den andra meningen men det jag märkt att modellering kan ge vitt skilda resultat beroende på vilka parametrar som används, så vars landar det i verkligheten? Dokumentet konstaterar också att det behövs mer forskning om bl. a. *""The proportion of asymptomatic cases and their role in transmission""*. Av texten i debattartikeln så förväntade jag mig en glasklar text med ""så här är det"".

&#x200B;

>Jag har varit i kontakt med många forskare som är förtvivlade över det sätt på vilket smittbekämpningen bedrivs. Vissa av dem har försökt göra sin stämma hörd via till exempel debattartiklar, andra har skrivit till Folkhälsomyndighetens representanter och till politiker, men ingenting fungerar.

Nu vet jag inte hur många forskare som varit involverade i det här i slutändan men har inte åtminstone ett par av dessa forskare publicerat endera rena felaktigheter eller haft hysteriskt fel i deras förutsägelser? Så om FHM har haft fel och dessa forskare har haft fel, varför är dessa forskare mer trovärdiga?

&#x200B;

>Det ena är en vädjan till våra politiker att ta ett större ansvar för den kris vi nu upplever. Det andra är en uppmaning till oss alla: var betydligt försiktigare än de påbud som utgått från myndigheter, för din skull och för allas skull. För om vi inte känner tilltro till våra myndigheter återstår bara att vi måste lita på varandra.""

Ingen rak kommenter på texten utan mer en reflektion. Jag upplever det mycket som att folk säger att dom tappat tilltro till myndigheter (främst FHM) men att sättet de läser data & fakta, ignorerar viss data, misstolkar uttalanden etc mer tyder på att de inte hade någon tilltro från början. Vilket då sedemera givetvis färgar deras åsikter. Här kan jag givetvis ha helt fel.

&#x200B;

>Stefan Einhorn, professor i molekylär onkologi och ordförande i Centrum för social hållbarhet vid Karolinska Institutet.

Jag upplever att efter all denna text så har det inte presenterats några konkreta punkter för dessa stora fel men att det på något sätt ska rättfärdigas med ""Trust me, I'm a professor""."

2020-04-13,IHateClickingLinks,navy,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/g0icfk/as_in_if_things_couldnt_get_worse/fn9slys/,">On April 2, Mr. Modly called Admiral Baker, Captain Crozier’s immediate boss on the Roosevelt, and asked him if he knew about the letter in advance. Admiral Baker said that he did not, and that he would have told Captain Crozier not to send it. As Mr. Modly explained in an interview he later gave to the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, he decided to fire Captain Crozier after that conversation.

>Later that morning, Mr. Modly told Admiral Gilday, General Milley and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper that he had decided to fire Captain Crozier even before an investigation was conducted. The three told him they would publicly support his decision, despite the reservations of General Milley and Admiral Gilday.

>Representative Adam Smith, the Washington Democrat who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, condemned the move, as did three other Democrats on the panel. But they acknowledged that Captain Crozier might have mishandled the situation.

>“Throwing the commanding officer overboard without a thorough investigation is not going to solve the growing crisis aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt,” the lawmakers said in a statement. “What’s more, we are very concerned about the chilling effect this dismissal will have on commanders throughout the Department of Defense.”

>The dismissal and subsequent investigation hit the ship’s medical department hard right away. The same day Captain Crozier walked off the ship for the last time, Adm. Robert P. Burke, the Navy’s second-highest admiral, called the senior medical officer aboard the carrier as part of his investigation. Admiral Burke criticized the doctor, saying he had failed as a leader. In interviews, two crew members said Admiral Burke’s tone was hostile.

>In an email, the Navy’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Charles W. Brown, said Admiral Burke “spoke with multiple individuals involved during the course of his investigation into the communication aboard U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt and with the chain of command.”

>As Captain Crozier walked off his ship and down the gangway wearing a black backpack and baseball cap, hundreds of sailors and aircrew members showed up on the hangar bay to form a corridor for him. Videos of the crew cheering and shouting “Captain Crozier” immediately went viral.

>And that, Navy officials said, infuriated Mr. Modly. His next actions stunned Pentagon officials and effectively turned the crew of the Roosevelt even more solidly against him.

>Mr. Modly boarded a Gulfstream business jet at an airfield in suburban Washington and made the 35-hour round-trip flight to Guam, at a cost of $243,116.65, according to a Navy official, confirming a report in USA Today. When he landed, he spoke with Mr. Ignatius to defend himself. He also wrote a letter to The New York Times in which he again criticized the captain he had fired and who had, by now, tested positive for the coronavirus.

>Then he went to the Roosevelt and delivered a 15-minute diatribe over the ship’s loudspeakers berating the crew for cheering for its captain. He called Captain Crozier either “too naïve” or “too stupid” to command an aircraft carrier. He told the sailors they should never trust the media. He blamed China for the virus. Less than 30 minutes later, after taking no questions from the sailors, he was gone.

>Within another 30 minutes of his visit, audio of his remarks was being shared broadly across social media, complete with crew reaction. “What the…?” one sailor was heard saying when Mr. Modly called Captain Crozier “stupid.”

>Navy officials, inundated with calls from incredulous reporters, called Mr. Modly — now flying back from Guam — asking him to respond. He doubled down, issuing a statement that “I stand by every word I said.”

>By now, lawmakers were calling for him to be fired. So, too, were current and former military officials.

>“What he said to the crew, I just completely disagree with that,” Mike Mullen, a retired admiral who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said in an interview. “The content of it, how he said it, and actually, even that he was there on that ship to say it.”

>Mr. Modly’s plane landed at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on Monday night. In a phone call, Mr. Esper told him that he had to apologize, Defense Department officials said.

>Seven hours after issuing his “I stand by every word I said” statement, Mr. Modly backpedaled. “I do not think Captain Brett Crozier is naïve nor stupid,” he said. “I think and always believed him to be the opposite.”

>But the damage had been done. The next day, Mr. Modly, now in isolation himself because of potential exposure to the virus during his trip to the ship, called Mr. Esper to offer his resignation. A spokesman for Mr. Modly did not respond to a request for comment.

>As for Captain Crozier, he remains alone in the “distinguished visitors quarters” on Naval Base Guam, battling a coronavirus infection. The 584 other crew members who have tested positive are also in quarantine on Guam, along with nearly 4,000 sailors who have been moved off the ship. One sailor with the virus remains in intensive care at the naval hospital on the island.

>Navy officials say the Roosevelt may be fully cleaned and ready to resume its operations in the Pacific this month. More than 345,000 people have signed an online petition to reinstate Captain Crozier, a step that Admiral Gilday did not rule out last week.

>Amid the fallout from Captain Crozier’s letter, senior military officials say they are concerned about other warships and other missions.

>“From my perspective, I think it’s not a good idea to think that the Teddy Roosevelt is a one-of-a-kind issue,” Gen. John E. Hyten, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Thursday. “To think that it will never happen again is not a good way to plan.”

>Three other carriers — the Ronald Reagan, the Carl Vinson and the Nimitz — have had sailors test positive, and the Navy is rushing to resolve their cases."

And [here](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) is the model itself. 

For Illinois specifically, [this](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/illinois) is the model and [this](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/07/825479416/new-yorks-coronavirus-deaths-may-level-off-soon-when-might-your-state-s-peak) is an NPR article discussing the significance of state-to-state variation and how to interpret it. 

Personal conclusion: If the models are accurate, Illinois may begin to return to normal in May. This doesn't mean May 1st will hit and everything will go back to normal. I'd guess schools remain closed for the semester, shelter in place ends early to mid May, with restaurants and bars opening mid to late May. Everything will be phased in, not all at once. Travel to outside of the state may be restricted depending how our neighbors are doing (County officials in Missouri have enacted stay-at-home policies, but I have not read of the Missouri State government doing anything for example).

Edit: May, not March."

One of the things that tie into this is privacy issues during the coronaviru response especially contact tracking

Basically one of the main proposed strategies to allow us to go back to work  involves trying to track who someone got the disease from and whom they might have been given it to so they can be tested and possibly isolated. One way to do this is putting an app on everyone's phone and using it to track everyone you've been in contact with. 

Another thing is the need to track who has already had the disease (as they might be immune to catching it again).

15% mehr ist jetzt nicht ""deutlich mehr"" - v.a. nicht, wenn man bedenkt, dass Schweden 5x so groß ist (ja, der Großteil wohnt in Städten, trotzdem ein Unterschied)

Würden die Schweden auch 3x so viele Tests machen, um auf die selbe Zahl an ""Tests/Million"" zu kommen wie wir, dann wären dort wohl die Fallzahlen wesentlich höher.

Und jetzt kommts, weil in Wikipedia das nämlich nicht dabei steht:

Todesfälle in Schweden: ca. 920

*So this is hell. I'd never have believed it.*

* A Brazilian trial of chloroquine [was halted early](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056424v1) due to cardiac toxicity. The team had enrolled 81 patients in a parallel, double-blinded, randomised IIb trial with high dose (600mg BD 10/7) or low dose (450mg OD 5/7) CQ, with all patients also receiving cef and azithromycin. One assumes that the dose-dependent arrhythmias that developed were exacerbated by the interaction with azithromycin; the higher chloroquine dose seems rather [ambitious](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913\(20\)30093-X/fulltext) but was reportedly [based loosely on Chinese data](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/health/chloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html).

> Within three days, researchers started noticing heart arrhythmias in patients taking the higher dose. By the sixth day of treatment, 11 patients had died, leading to an immediate end to the high-dose segment of the trial.

> Preliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards. Such results forced us to prematurely halt patient recruitment to this arm. Given the enormous global push for the use of CQ for COVID-19, results such as the ones found in this trial can provide robust evidence for updated COVID-19 patient management recommendations.

> Several clinical trials for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are testing low doses for shorter periods of time in coronavirus patients. But the Health Commission of Guangdong Province in China had initially recommended those sick with the virus be treated with 500 milligrams of chloroquine twice daily for 10 days. One of the authors of the Brazilian study, Dr. Marcus Lacerda, said in an email on Sunday that his study found that “the high dosage that the Chinese were using is very toxic and kills more patients.”

* Everyone seems to be struggling with the hypercoagulable/pathocoagulable states that COVID-19 seems to induce, either as a direct disease consequence secondary to microangiopathic endothelial damage or as a maladapted host response. [Anticoagulation strategies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jth.14810) are [all over the shop](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVcuaYDXQAEBWfo?format=jpg&name=4096x4096), and we don't have [much good data](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jth.14830). TEG/ROTEM may augment our usual parameters in determining what to do, and the IBCC has a new podcast that touches on this subject [here](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/covid19/#podcast). An American autopsy series from New Orleans confirms [pulmonary microvascular thromboses](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/04/10/2020.04.06.20050575.full.pdf):

> Important additional mechanisms that may have contributed to death in this initial series of autopsies include a thrombotic microangiopathy that was restricted to the lungs. This process may involve activation of megakaryocytes, possibly those native to the lung, with platelet aggregation and platelet-rich clot formation, in addition to fibrin deposition. Small vessel thrombus formation in the lung periphery was in many cases associated with foci of alveolar hemorrhage.

* Perhaps related but still very preliminary is a small report of thirteen patients [treated with inhaled plasminogen](https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/advance-article/doi/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa121/5818885), the circulating zymogen of plasmin, the primary enzyme responsible for fibrin degradation:

> After plasminogen inhalation, conditions of lung lesions in 5 clinically moderate patients have quickly improved, shown as the decreased range and density of ‘ground glass’ opacity. Improvements of oxygen saturation were observed in 6 clinically severe patients. In the 2 patients with critical conditions, the oxygen levels have significantly increased from 79-82% to 91% just about 1 hour after the first inhalation. In 8 of 13 patients the heart rates had slowed down. For the 5 clinically moderate patients, the difference is even statistically significant. Furthermore, a general relief of chest tightness was observed.

I will reiterate that this is still very experimental and there may be author conflicts of interest.

* Neurological manifestations of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan are [discussed in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2764549):

> Of 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7%]) with COVID-19, 126 patients (58.9%) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1%) had severe infection according to their respiratory status. Overall, 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations. Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough. Patients with more severe infection had neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).

> Central nervous system symptoms were the main form of neurologic injury in patients with COVID-19 in this study. The pathologic mechanism may be from the CNS invasion of SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS and MERS viruses. As with other respiratory viruses, SARS-COV-2 may enter the CNS through the hematogenous or retrograde neuronal route. The latter can be supported by the fact that some patients in this study had smell impairment. We also found that the lymphocyte counts were lower for patients with CNS symptoms than without CNS symptoms. This phenomenon may be indicative of the immunosuppression in patients with COVID-19 with CNS symptoms, especially in the severe subgroup. Moreover, we found patients with severe infection had higher D-dimer levels than that of patients with nonsevere infection. This may be the reason why patients with severe infection are more likely to develop cerebrovascular disease.

* Collateral damage and emergency non-presentation has been discussed before, but now we have a [bit more data suggesting](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/government-campaign-will-urge-seriously-ill-not-to-avoid-hospitals) that seriously ill members of the public are avoiding attending A&E because of fears of COVID. As medditors have mused already, there are probably a lot of people toughing it out at home with NSTEMIs, flareups, TIAs, etc.

> Simon Ray, president of British Cardiovascular Society, said he welcomed a campaign to draw attention to the problem. “The biggest concern is that it seems there has been a uniform reduction in hospital attendances for heart attacks that has been noted in Italy, Spain and here. The magnitude looks the same everywhere: it’s around 40% down in terms of callouts for emergency treatment for heart attacks.” He added: “Then there also seems to be substantial reduction in referrals in for with acute coronary syndrome, which is one step down from a heart attack, so people coming in with chest pain – those attendances also seem to have gone down a lot. That is harder to quantify, but the decrease in those is at least as large, and also seen across southern Europe and the US.”

* Harvard's Marc Lipsitch has penned an article [in the NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-immunity.html) with some musings about individual and herd immunity, reinfection, immune enhancement, and decisionmaking based on suspected immunity.

* The Atlantic is carrying a [spicy article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/world-health-organization-blame-pandemic-coronavirus/609820/) about China having deceived the WHO. It's quite provocative, but makes allowances for the structural/systemic weaknesses inherent in the WHO's reliance on its members acting in good faith.

* There's a lengthy New Yorker profile of Fauci [here](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-anthony-fauci-became-americas-doctor) for those interested.

* Employees of Biogen, a Boston-based drug company, inadvertently became superspreaders in one of the [USA's earliest events of this sort](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/coronavirus-biogen-boston-superspreader.html) during meetings held to discuss the company's controversial Alzheimer's drug. Whoops.

> Although some other companies canceled international meetings around that time, Biogen never discussed doing so. The outbreak was raging in China but had not yet been declared a worldwide pandemic. As of Feb. 21, the Friday before the meeting, the United States had only 30 confirmed cases, according to data compiled by The Times. Biogen executives in Germany, Switzerland and Italy — where there were just 20 known cases — packed their bags. On the first night, about 175 executives gathered for a buffet dinner and cocktails at the Marriott Long Wharf overlooking Boston Harbor. Colleagues who hadn’t seen each other in a year shook hands and vied for face time with bosses. Europeans gave customary kisses on both cheeks.

* Finally, there's an interesting human experiences story about the class divide that comes from 'Shelter-In-Place' orders [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/coronavirus-poverty-privacy.html).

> “The pandemic is a reminder that privacy is at a premium among the poor — hard to find and extremely valuable,” said Stefanie DeLuca, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University. “Living in crowded conditions not only increases the risk of infection but can also impose serious emotional and mental health costs. The ability to retreat into one’s own space is a way to cope with conflict, tension and anxiety.”"

Like the one from Michigan that said people are [not allowed to go to their second homes](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/04/13/michigan-stay-at-home-executive-order-faq-coronavirus/2981391001/). I don't understand why the government thinks it has the authority to stop me from leaving my property, traveling as is my right, and then finishing that travel also at my property. If I do, according to the order I'm civilly liable for 1000$ and a possible criminal misdemeanor. 

Before anyone says it, I know these things are empirically supported ways to stop the virus. I know people fleeing hotspots spreads the virus. I am not arguing their effectiveness. It would be stupid and irresponsible to take a trip to your second home in this climate. But stupid and irresponsible is not a good enough reason to make it unlawful. Might as well just weld people inside like China, that would be the most effective way to stop it. 

Whenever I bring up these concerns, people say ""Oh but the police won't enforce them"" or ""It's just while the cases peak"", but that isn't the point. A national emergency is the perfect cover to erode human rights. The constitution does not have a clause saying ""but if you need to ignore this for a pandemic that's all cool"". 

I've been at home, and I will remain at home to reduce risk to myself and others. But I don't believe the government should get to order me to do that."

HIV is a retrovirus that incorporates itself into the patient's own DNA. Also HIV is an immune suppressive virus that specifically targets immune cells.

Norovirus is a category of viruses with 7 different genogroups and multiple different sub-genotypes per group. If you catch a norovirus twice, you almost definitely caught two different strains of it that don't have cross-immunity.

Measles is a good case of a virus that is pretty stable and that once you catch it, you get long-lasting immunity. Hence why the measles vaccine is so effective. The vaccine confers long-lasting immunity if given in a two-stage vaccination during childhood. Between that and herd immunity in western societies where most people are immune means that most people will never actually be infected by measles, although the anti-vaxxers are causing a resurgence of measles in some communities...

Bird flu is a specific variant of the influenza virus, which is one of the most highly adaptive and frequently mutating viruses that we know of. Which is why it's impossible to get fully accurate flu vaccines every year because that virus mutates so frequently.

I don't know much about Ebola so can't really comment on it

And the common cold is actually a very broad category of bacterial and viral infections of different types. So if you get the common cold twice, you got it from different sources.


The coronavirus, by contrast, is a relatively simple RNA virus with a small genome and seems to be relatively stable in terms of mutations. Of course there are a number of different strains of coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, about 15% of common colds.) But SARS and MERS seem to not mutate too frequently and immunity to reinfection seems to be strong from what I've seen."

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well.

Take that gay mods."

China Limited the Mekong’s Flow. Other Countries Suffered a Drought.

New research show that Beijing’s engineers appear to have directly caused the record low levels of water in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.

Updated 10:14 a.m. ET
BANGKOK — As China was stricken by the coronavirus in late February, its foreign minister addressed a concerned crowd in Laos, where farmers and fishers across the Mekong River region were contending with the worst drought in living memory.

His message: We feel your pain. The foreign minister, Wang Yi, said China was also suffering from arid conditions that were sucking water from one of the world’s most productive rivers.

But new research from American climatologists shows for the first time that China, where the headwaters of the Mekong spring forth from the Tibetan Plateau, was not experiencing the same hardship at all. Instead, Beijing’s engineers appear to have directly caused the record low water levels by limiting the river’s flow.

“The satellite data doesn’t lie, and there was plenty of water in the Tibetan Plateau, even as countries like Cambodia and Thailand were under extreme duress,” said Alan Basist, who co-wrote the report, which was released on Monday, for Eyes on Earth, a water resources monitor.

“There was just a huge volume of water that was being held back in China,” Mr. Basist added.

The Mekong is one of the most fertile rivers on earth, nurturing tens of millions of people with its nutrient rich waters and fisheries. But a series of dams, mostly in China, have robbed the river’s riches.

Those who depend on its inland fisheries say their catches have declined precipitously. Persistent droughts and sudden floods have buffeted farmers.

Beijing’s control of the upstream Mekong, which provides as much as 70 percent of the downstream water in the dry season, has raised hackles, even though the Southeast Asian nations depend on trade with China. While the Chinese government has introduced a global development program that it says will benefit poorer trading partners, a backlash is growing among countries that feel they are losing out.

“The problem is that the Chinese elite see water as something for their use, not as a shared commodity,” said Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Center’s Southeast Asia program and author of “Last Days of the Mighty Mekong.”

As China’s geopolitical weight has grown, its leaders have cast the nation as a different kind of superpower, one that is concerned, as the Chinese phrasing goes, with “win-win” relationships with other nations.

But some countries, like Sri Lanka and Djibouti, have fallen into what critics fear are debt traps, as strategic projects end up in Chinese hands. Other African and Asian nations are worried that China is simply another imperial power eager to vacuum up natural resources without concern for the local populace.

“This is part of China’s business development,” said Chainarong Setthachua, a lecturer and Mekong expert at Mahasarakham University in northeastern Thailand. “The lay people who depend on the resources of the Mekong River for their livelihoods and income are automatically excluded.”

The data modeling created by Mr. Basist and his colleague Claude Williams measures the various components of a river’s flow, from snow and glacial melt to rainfall and soil moisture. The scientists found that for most years, the natural, unimpeded flow of the upstream Mekong roughly tracked water levels measured downstream at a gauge in Thailand, with occasional exceptions when dam reservoirs in China were being filled or released.

When there was a seasonal drought in China, the five downstream nations — Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam — would eventually feel it. When there was overabundant water in China, floods ensued in the Mekong basin.

But during last year’s wet season, the fortunes of the river’s two parts diverged in dramatic fashion. As China’s section of the Mekong welcomed an above average volume of water, downstream countries were stricken by a drought so crushing that parts of the river dried up entirely, leaving cracked riverbed exposed in a season when fishing should have been plentiful.

At one gauge in Chiang Saen, in northern Thailand, such low water levels had never been recorded before.

Overall, during the 28-year period they studied this gauge, Mr. Basist and his colleague calculated that dams in China had held back more than 410 feet of river height.

While addressing regional foreign ministers in February, Mr. Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, contended that China, too, was suffering. He suggested that the Chinese leadership was being magnanimous by sending water downstream, especially at a time when Beijing was contending with a severe coronavirus outbreak.

“Though China itself has also been afflicted by the drought and a serious shortage of precipitation in the upper reaches, it has overcome various difficulties to increase the water discharge,” he said.

Mr. Basist disputed this take.

“You look at our mapping, and it’s bright blue with plenty of water in China and bright red from an extreme lack of water in Thailand and Cambodia,” he said. “China can regulate this river’s flow through dams, and that appears to be exactly what it’s doing.”

Adding to the downstream pain were sudden releases of water from China, which often came unannounced and drowned crops that had been planted near the banks because of the drought.

“The water release by China is political,” said Mr. Chainarong, of Mahasarakham University. “It’s made out to be them doing a favor. They create damage, but they ask for gratitude.”

While the Mekong is a lifeline for residents of downstream nations, the river rushes through narrow gorges in China, making it impractical for economic activity other than hydropower. At the turn of this century, the Chinese government, whose leadership at the time was dominated by engineers, began accelerating plans to dam the Lancang, as the Mekong is known in China.

Today, the Chinese section of the river in the nation’s southwest is punctuated by 11 major dams, which produce far more power than the region needs. Other great rivers that begin in the icy reaches of the Tibetan Plateau, like the Brahmaputra, a holy river to Hindus in India, have also been dammed in China.

The existing energy glut was one reason Chinese environmentalists succeeded in persuading the government to shelve plans to dam another river in the region, the Nu, which becomes the Salween when it enters Myanmar.

Yet even as Beijing began its hydropower push on the Mekong, it refused to join Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos in a regional group dedicated to the river’s health. In one survey commissioned by the group, the Mekong River Commission, scientists warned that a dam boom on the Mekong could rob the river of 97 percent of the sediment that flows to its mouth in Vietnam.

“The river will be dead,” said Niwat Roykaew, a community organizer and conservationist in northern Thailand.

Instead, Beijing created its own Lancang-Mekong Cooperation initiative and financed a lavish building for the group in Cambodia, where Prime Minister Hun Sen has brought the country firmly into Beijing’s orbit. Critics accuse the Beijing-funded initiative of being less a mechanism for protecting the river and more a mouthpiece for China’s campaign on the Mekong.

But even Mr. Hun Sen, Asia’s longest serving autocrat, appears to have been shaken by the devastating lack of water in the Mekong, which accelerated last July. The energy ministry announced last month that Cambodia was suspending plans for dams on the Mekong, which would have been mostly funded by China.

Meanwhile, the water reserves in China swelled, as dam reservoirs filled with the glacial melt that has fed the Mekong for millenniums.

“Glaciers are bank accounts of water but with climate change they’re melting fast,” Mr. Basist said. “The Chinese are building safe deposit boxes on the upper Mekong because they know the bank account is going to be depleted eventually and they want to keep it in reserve.”"

2020-04-13,Helluvme,politics,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/g0orjb/megathread_senator_bernie_sanders_endorses_joe/fnbuflp/,"There are several reasons I will vote for Joe Biden, few of which have to do with Joe Biden. For one, Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 87. She was born in 1933, people; no amount of reverence from the blue states will make the rules of the human game — we are born, we die — less likely to apply to her. Another is Donald Trump, a man who alludes to having sex with models in the middle of a pandemic briefing.
Still, Biden will probably lose, regardless of how I or the Democratic Socialists of America or anyone else votes, because he is a uniquely uninspiring candidate; Joe Biden is three children in a trenchcoat, twice passed-over, alternately psychobabbling and walking out of the frame. There is one hope yet: if Biden nominates Amy Klobuchar to be his vice president. Now that would activate the youth vote! Kidding, I'm kidding. Ninety percent of voters under age 40 couldn't pick Klobuchar out of a lineup of four brunettes; the other 10% know her for eating salad with a hairbrush. (Unofficial poll.) Her brightest campaign moment was scoring third in the New Hampshire primary. That's the dream team, baby.

Three years after the #MeToo movement told survivors their experiences were speakable, we now have the right to choose between two men accused of sexual assault and harassment — and the rumored carrot for the Democrats’ guy is that he might choose an alleged workplace abuser … who is a woman!!!! Girl power!!! Forgive me if the roars of support I'm now obliged to affect get stuck in my throat.

We are now in a pandemic, being led by one of the world's great morons, who has only a handful of capable public servants still standing around him. It's quite hard to imagine how Joe Biden would lead differently, given that as coronavirus spread across the United States, Biden went dark. For some reason, no one — not even Symone Sanders, the capable strategist who served as Bernie Sanders’ national press secretary in 2016 and has since switched to the Biden camp — can get the guy from walking out of the frame of his own video.
Disappearing was functionally what he did throughout the debates; Biden often ceded his time back, making a point to tell the moderator he was sure he'd nearly hit his limit. Nothing to say, framed as gentility. Imagine having nothing to say right now.
Speak to it or around it, but Biden’s cognition is declining; he's barely in the race. As the field consolidated around him, it became hard to imagine a likelier outcome for January 2021 than the orange king being re-coronated before what is sure to be another record-breaking, incredible, awe-inspiring crowd, the likes of which have never been seen before!
But just one — OK fine, a dozen! — more thing(s) I hate — quickly! I hate that when Ginsburg dies Roe vs. Wade will be overturned and millions of young women will not live the lives they wanted or intended to live. I hate that the future of reproductive choice rests on one very old person. 

I hate how Biden treated Anita Hill and how he had the opportunity to apologize and botched the job. I hate that the mainstream media barely covered the recent sexual assault accusations against Biden by former aide Tara Reade. I hate Biden's unapologetic handsiness and his empty chivalry and the smarmy, entitled projection that he was the only choice from day one. I hate many of Biden's past votes and positions. I hate that I am now in the position of either voting for one of two men I would not comfortably leave my daughters alone in a room with or forgo what I believe is a core civic duty.


Biden's main selling point for president is that he's a seat filler. He will, we are assured, do little. He will do so little it will be like it was before; we will sink drowsily into the past. I hate that.


Sanders has said he intends to push Biden to the left and I dearly hope he achieves that. But regardless of whether Biden moves, I will get behind the Democratic nominee. Against all internal resistance, I will vote for creepy hair sniffer Joe Biden, a man who both should be and does not deserve to be president."

2) Since you mention buying in London.... One in 50 houses in London is AirBNB listed.  Many of these will flooded the rental market as AirBNB is not viable during Coronavirus. (https://www.wired.co.uk/article/airbnb-coronavirus-london) ... a further argument toward house price crash incoming 

3) renting gives you a “try before you buy” test of what an area is like

4) you remain ‘locationally liquid’. Can pick up better salary rises / job opportunities elsewhere by moving house / area often

>However, a [recent study under review ](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.951335v1)shows     that the genome of the coronavirus isolated from the Malaysian        pangolin (Manis javanica) is less similar to SARS-Cov-2, with only 90%        of genomic concordance. This would indicate that the virus  isolated     in   the pangolin is not responsible for the COVID-19  epidemic   currently     raging.

>this strongly indicated that civets were only one link in the chain of transmission.

this kind of misunderstanding was spread to create a diversion from the true intermediate host and the true source of the virus. it's like we have a murder crime and nobody is looking at the rich powerful man with the bloody knife and instead we are all told to focus on the old retired poor neighbor who can't possibly defend himself. the consumption of these animals and these markets have been around for 100's if not 1000's of years. I would suggest people look to things that have actually changed in wuhan as this is the second time a sars related virus is being blamed on the very same thing. 

in a crime scene people look for things that have changed. nobody focuses on things that always been a certain way for 100's if not 1000's of years."

And you are saving more, day by day. \[...\] No, this pandemic is not a war. It does not pit nations against nations, or soldiers against soldiers. Rather, it is a test of our humanity.

* **Leopoldina, the National Academy of Sciences,** has published a [report](https://www.leopoldina.org/uploads/tx_leopublication/2020_04_13_Coronavirus-Pandemie-Die_Krise_nachhaltig_%C3%BCberwinden_final.pdf) with recommendations for the coming weeks. It is supposed to be the foundation for governmental decisions. In short: Voluntary tracking app, reopening schools with masks for students and teachers (good luck, dear elementary school teachers..) in classes of no more than 15 students and separated breaks, no reopening of kindergarden facilities since masking would not be possible there, mostly online semester in universitites. Remaining in home-office for all employees for whom it is possible, public masks in all situations where a proper distance cannot be kept and always in public transit.
* Nearly every German state has **taken in Italian, French or Dutch patients** or at leased offered ICU beds ([source](https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article207207005/Corona-Krise-In-der-Krise-wird-Deutschland-zum-heimlichen-Helden-Europas.html)). The proportion of patients from the **Netherlands** is increasing with the country having a CFR (as in temporary CFR based on currently registered positives!) five times higher than the German one. With a lower pre-pandemic ICU capacity (925 beds for 17 mio. people compared with 28k beds for 83 mio.), the Netherlands fared well outside of COVID-19 but now they are getting more dependent on sending younger, promising ICU canditates over the border to Northrhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony mostly. Which leaves a bitter taste, keeping in mind how the Dutch government was about to join the *Johnson purge* approach. Economically weaker, **Belgium** e.g. fares better with 45% of the national ICU capacity available ([source in German](https://www.grenzecho.net/34480/artikel/2020-04-12/coronavirus-belgien-die-halfte-aller-intensivbetten-sind-belegt), yep, there is a smallish 60k German minority in Belgium with an own newspaper). Word is, the Dutch colleagues are sending their patients over with perfectly translated English paperwork as a humble brag. While you're likely to find someone with decent French and Italian in German hospitals, Dutch is harder since the linguistic relations between our countries are asymmetrical: Way more Dutch speak or at least understand German than vice versa.  Ik vind het triest!

If the number is close to reality, it would be actually a decent one, given that 6.8% of the entire population are working in health care. It means at least, that HCWs don't seem to be affected overproportionally often. 72% of the infected HCWs are women, showing who is keeping the country running.

2020-04-13,LindyNet,nfl,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/g0jtds/raiders_prepare_for_allegiant_stadium/fna1n31/,"If the coronavirus crisis were to delay the completion of Allegiant Stadium, the Raiders have contingency plans that could include finding a temporary place to play.

Before signing their final lease with the Oakland Coliseum last offseason, the Raiders investigated options that included playing games in Salt Lake City, Phoenix and San Diego, and it is realistic to think that all of those options could be resurrected. A person close to the situation, however, indicated that scenario remains the most unlikely and would only be triggered in an absolute worst-case scenario.


If there is a delay that creates a significant setback, a more likely solution is using the preseason and early part of the regular season as the means by which the Raiders and the NFL can buy back the necessary time to complete the stadium in time to host a normal eight-game home schedule.

All of which would be predicated, of course, on the NFL beginning its season as scheduled. And with COVID-19 casting some doubt on that happening, the entire dynamic could change as a result.

At the moment, Allegiant Stadium remains on track for the Raiders to host two late summer preseason games and an eight-game home schedule. The roof is scheduled to be completed within two weeks, leaving the bulk of the remaining work in the interior of the facility.

If COVID-19 forces a delay that pushes the opening back, though, the Raiders could play all four preseason games on the road to create a monthlong window for stadium completion. There is also the possibility of the Raiders playing their first few regular-season games on the road to extend that work window even further.

If so, whatever time was lost in construction would sufficiently be made up.

The NFL, expected to release the regular-season schedule in the next month, also could designate the first month of the Raiders’ season for AFC West divisional matchups. That would create flexibility to manipulate the schedule by flipping home and away games. For instance, what was originally scheduled as a Raiders home game against the Broncos in September could be changed to a Denver home game, with the Broncos then playing the Raiders in Las Vegas later in the season.

For now, the Raiders remain confident Allegiant Stadium will open as scheduled.

As a South Florida emergency room doctor, Dr. Theresa Greene relishes her work helping patients suffering from the novel coronavirus that has upended the world in a few short months.

As a mother, she’s also valued the extra time with her 4-year-old daughter, who is now home from pre-kindergarten because of the pandemic, as she teaches the girl simple math and memorizing letters.

But Greene’s dual roles are in jeopardy after a Miami-Dade judge, citing the heightened risk of the child being infected by her mother, temporarily stripped her of parental custody. Greene’s ex-husband, Eric Greene, with whom the doctor shares custody of the child, had asked the judge to shield the girl from her mother.

“The suspension is solely related to the outbreak of COVID-19,” Circuit Judge Bernard Shapiro wrote in his order released Friday."

Exactly! People prefer content that supports their pre-existing biases, and the upvote system reinforces this bias. 

I used to be a huge fan of this sort of format on Reddit, because I love the democratization of reviews and such on Amazon and Yelp. I find that it does overall improve the quality of the products. But, over time, it's become clear that there is an entire industry of gaming these systems.

I have found something similar on Reddit: there is a method to gaming the reddit masses, and the most ridiculous reposters reign supreme. Just drop coin into pre-existing bias slot, and bingo, Jackpot.

Whereas there is no way to prefer or especially elevate the opinions/reviews of experts. And I recognize that could be construed as elitism, but for some things like science... I really do know more than some people! If we're talking about a viral vaccine, at least. 

It's gotta be similar to the infectious issues Democracy is facing as a system now. People can game the democratic system and become demagogues by relying and hitting on the primal urges/instincts of individuals.

Right now, there is a viral meme that's spreading throughout conservative/prepper/doomsday communities, that [the ever-amorphous ""they"" are utilizing this pandemic as a window to institute full unbridled martial law](https://www.newsweek.com/inside-us-militarys-plans-stop-civil-disturbances-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-something-they-1493485). Arresting anyone who dissents. And that it is up to these lone wolves and militias to exercise their fundamental rights and disobey the quarantine, and defend civil liberty! 

This meme also takes the form of ""there is only so much thinking americans can take before they snap and disobey all rules."" As if america is somehow a police state now. 

You can look at [the actual data](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-drug-arrests-down-42-since-start-of-coronavirus-pandemic/2254436/) -- [arrests are down across the board](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/19/nation/look-bright-side-arrests-are-way-down-during-coronavirus-outbreak/)!

Also, if someone has a bunch of health issues yet dies while having the Coronavirus, the cause of death will be declared as COVID-19. So numbers can be inflated. Plus, many people who had the Coronavirus barely had any symptoms yet couldn’t get tested so the death rate should be a lot lower than it actually is. 

If someone actually stops watching the mainstream media news and digs deep and does their own research, they will realize that something is going on because we are basically shutting down the world for nothing crazy out of the ordinary compared to other years.

Let's see what Trump actually did during this pandemic.

>As the first alarms sounded in early January that an outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China might ignite a global pandemic, the Trump administration squandered nearly two months that could have been used to bolster the federal stockpile of critically needed medical supplies and equipment.[[1]]

Back in early February, Human and Health Services Secretary Alex Azar, requested $2 billion in an effort to buy needed supplies in preparation for the inevitability of a COVID-19 outbreak in the US. 

>The $2 billion request from HHS was cut to $500 million when the White House eventually sent Congress a supplemental budget request weeks later.[[2]]

After that delayed response, the HHS has finally been given a $16 billion budget only after thousands have died from the virus.

>White House budget officials now say the relief package enacted Friday secured $16 billion for the Strategic National Stockpile, more money than HHS had asked for.[[2]]


Despite the warnings from experts, ""[...]federal agencies waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers.""[[2]] The Trump administration did little, if anything, to stymie the effects of the pandemic.[[2]][[23]]


Trump, himself, dismissed the calls to action by calling the criticism of his administration not doing enough a ""new hoax,""[[3]] even after having slashed the funds requested by the HHS earlier in the month to prepare for the outbreak in the US.


While dismissing criticism of his preparation, ""as early as mid-January, U.S. officials could see that hospitals in China’s Hubei province were overwhelmed with infected patients, with many left dependent on ventilator machines to breathe."" [[1]] Yet, despite being warned of the severity of the situation and the virtual certainty of it coming to the US, the Trump administration did little.[[1]][[3]][[28]]


What the Whitehouse *did* do, however, was undermine the ability to contain the spread:


>“There were many, many opportunities not to end up where we are,” Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard, told the AP. “Basically, they took this as business as usual. ... And that’s because the messaging from the White House was ‘this is not a big deal, this is no worse than the flu.’ So that message basically created no sense of urgency within the FDA or the CDC to fix it.”[[4]]


All while this pandemic continues, Trump has lied to the people:


**Jan. 22:** “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”[[5]]


**Feb. 23:** “We have it very much under control in this country.”[[6]]


**Feb. 24:** “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”[[6]][[7]]


**Feb. 26:** This is a flu.  This is like a flu.”[[8]]


**Feb. 26:** “And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”[[6]][[8]]


**Feb. 27:** “It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.”[[6]][[9]]


**March 6:** “Anybody that needs a test, gets a test. They’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.”[[11]]


**March 7:** “No, I’m not concerned at all. No, we’ve done a great job with it.”[[10]]


**March 10:** “And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.”[[12]]


**March 12:** “The United States, because of what I did and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point.”[[13]]


**March 17:** ""I've always known this is a real — this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""[[14]][[15]]


**March 19:** “Nobody knew there’d be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.”[[26]][[27]]


Of course, after downplaying the threat of the coronavirus, often comparing it to the flu [[8]][[16]][[17]][[18]], he pivoted to saying that he knew it could be bad, but that he simply didn’t want to alarm people:


“I knew everything. I knew it could be horrible, I knew it could be maybe good. I don't want to be a negative person.”[[19]][[24]]


**March 31:** “I just want — I just want to add, I think the one thing nobody really knew about this virus was how contagious it was.  It’s so incredibly contagious. And nobody knew that.”[[19]]


We’ve known since late January that the virus can be spread without a person showing signs of infection (i.e. asymptomatic).[[20]][[21]][[22]] Trump was also aware from, at least, two memos circulated within the administration warning of the threat of SARS-COV2, in addition to other sources [[28]][[35]]:


>“[The recommended strategy is aggressive containment] because of costs of a No Containment/Pandemic scenario are so staggering, including the possible loss of as many as half a million American lives.”[[Jan 29 memo][28]]


>“There is an increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1-2 million souls.”[[Feb. 23 memo][28]]


**March 31:** ""We inherited obsolete tests.""[[19]]


The ‘novel’ in ‘novel coronavirus’ means this is a new virus. While similarities exist, the same tests (these ‘obsolete’ tests) will not work on a new virus. The tests are not obsolete, they simply were never designed for a virus that didn’t exist when they were created.


Instead of being realistic in his communications to the American people, Trump blamed others and downplayed the severity of the situation. His brazen downplaying of a global pandemic caused many to not take the virus seriously, resulting in many more infections and little precautions taken by the population that looks to its leaders for guidance.[[29]][[30]][[31]][[32]]

This is an important finding because medical staff shoes are carrying the virus from one patient to another as they walk through wards. Also, it shows that it can live on the floor in any public building and be transmitted the same way. 

In addition, the virus was also found on computer mice, trash cans, and doorknobs, which means the medical staff must perform hand hygiene practices immediately after each patient contact.

Further, it has implications for how many medical workers may be exposed to the virus. An earlier study in *Lancet* suggested as many as 1/5 may become infected; this study shows that number may be bigger than that."

When we end the shutdown you know what will happen? More people will get infected because the disease will still be there

A lot of this talk of vaccines show how little actual research people have done for themselves. Immunity isn’t something that just instantaneously happens it takes time and a good amount at that. It won’t just happen overnight. Yes it’s a bad thing that many people are dying but, and as much as I don’t want to say it, there’s really not a lot we can do about it the Coronavirus is here to stay whether we like it or not.

The outside effort from conservative groups is expected to be led by Stephen Moore, a conservative at the Heritage Foundation who is close with White House economic officials; Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots; Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy organization; and Lisa Nelson, chief executive of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative organization with ties to the Koch Brothers, according to the three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details of an effort that had not been publicly revealed."

It was reported by China to the WHO on December 30 that there were 27 cases of pneumonia by an unknown cause.

January 4th, WHO made a social media post identifying an outbreak

January 5th, WHO made a formal declaration to global media that there was an outbreak

By January 9th it was identified as a novel coronavirus (as opposed to a novel influenza).

By January 13th the DNA sequence was shared to the NIH database and it had begun to spread to different countries.

January 14th the WHO acknowledged potential human to human spread within families and noted that a larger outbreak was possible

On January 21, the CDC announced the first case of travel-related Covid19 in the US.

By January 22, Wuhan was quarantined after the WHO stated there was clear evidence of human to human spread

January 22- 23 the WHO Director- General convened an Emergency Committee (EC) under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to assess whether the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern. The independent members from around the world could not reach a consensus based on the evidence available at the time. They asked to be reconvened within 10 days after receiving more information.

By January 25, there was documented international spread to countries including Japan, canada, Australia, France, Finland, Germany, and the UAE, etc.

January 30 the WHO Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee (EC). This was earlier than the 10-day period and only two days after the first reports of limited human-to-human transmission were reported outside China. This time, the EC reached consensus and advised the Director-General that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General accepted the recommendation and declared the novel coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV) a PHEIC. This is the 6th time WHO has declared a PHEIC since the International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force in 2005.

It wasn’t until Feb 2 that President Trump restricted travel from China and then the CDC was only screening patients who had a direct connection to Wuhan."

The examples you use don't really fit as useful illustrations. Smoking is bad for you, but tobacco is a drug and using it is a choice. Combatting cigarette use is best done through education. That might mean labelling laws, advertising restrictions, and literally teaching the dangers of smoking to kids.  

The flu has an entire industry—vaccine and other branches of pharma—devoted to preventing it every year. We tell people who have the flu to stay home. 

I don't mean to offend, but the way you are throwing this question out without any real position or analysis seems like disingenuous ""I'm just saying..."" skepticism. If you articulated your specific problems with the coronavirus response it might be easier to discuss proportionality issues."

I googled it.  I found no such thing.

In 2019, the Wuhan population grew by only 1.1 percent from 2018, according to a [U.N. projection](https://www.macrotrends.net/cities/20712/wuhan/population). While these figures are suggestive of an increase in the city's death rate above the population growth figure, they're not conclusive.

[https://www.newsweek.com/wuhan-covid-19-death-toll-may-tens-thousands-data-cremations-shipments-urns-suggest-1494914](https://www.newsweek.com/wuhan-covid-19-death-toll-may-tens-thousands-data-cremations-shipments-urns-suggest-1494914)

They had 56,000 cremations total from all causes of death (car accidents, cancer, etc..) over the course of an entire year.  That is 1583 more cremations than the year before that, and 2231 more than the year before that.  So that means that statistically, \~1500 or less of those cremations were unexpected deaths caused by the Coronavirus.

&#x200B;

>Some Wuhan residents estimate that the coronavirus death toll could be 26,000, based on the amount of urns being delivered

Current US death toll: 22,106

TL;DR there is some evidence it will slow down in the summer, at best it’ll die off, at worst it’ll give healthcare systems time to prepare for fall/winter. We just need to watch our behavior in summer given that (human to human transmission) is how it is now spreading.

Interesting description of the virus -

“Coronaviruses are a family of so-called ‘enveloped viruses’. This means they are coated in an oily coat, known as a lipid bilayer, studded with proteins that stick out like spikes of a crown, helping to give them their name – corona is Latin for crown.

Research on other enveloped viruses suggests that this oily coat makes the viruses more susceptible to heat than those that do not have one. In colder conditions, the oily coat hardens into a rubber-like state, much like fat from cooked meat will harden as it cools, to protect the virus for longer when it is outside the body. Most enveloped viruses tend to show strong seasonality as a result of this.”"

They then go on to criticize those that miss going out with friends and just want things to go back to normal. They call those who want normalcy sheep, idiots, normies or a collection of over used phrases. You find most of them on reddit or other types of social media. A good example is the r/Coronavirus subreddit.

2.  Well off suburbanites with good paying Jobs that allow them to work from home. They will get on Facebook or next door neighbor app and shun those who have a small family get together.

If we could've tested every worker at every essential facility at least once every two weeks, this would've gone a long way to preventing something like this. If we had enough PPE for this situation we could've made sure that these workers were protected. 

We would've been able to go to the manufacturer's of the reagents for the PCR testing, placed large bulk orders prior to March, could've placed large orders of PPE with the large manufacturers, could've secured any stored in warehouses, and could've started to use the Defense Production Act to have companies like GM manufacturer ventilators months before they would be needed. Could've even started to source for more PCR machines to be able to do the testing, heck my school has a ton of PCR machines and I highly doubt they're being used right now, and the could easily up our testing capability by 100 a day, if not more. And that is just one college. 

On day one of being President, Trump should've understood where we stand as a country and how well prepared we are for something like this. Knowing where we get our PPE from, where we get our reagents from, and realizing that Chinese manufacturing was going to be shuttered so we have to prepare on our own. He failed at pretty much all of this. 

Even without a pandemic response team in place, Trump could've heeded the warnings by the CDC on Jan 8 and started to act then, but he failed to do so.

The model-minority myth is a lie that silences the structural economic racism Asian-Americans have endured and the intergenerational traumas our families have experienced from years of Western colonialism, wars and invasions. I hated talking about the model-minority myth because it was like being stuck in a feedback loop. After refuting that myth, I was dragged back to refute it again. But when the pandemic struck, I realized how deeply entrenched that myth was in the psyches of not only whites but other people of color.

>The coronavirus at least burned away any illusions that East Asians are almost white. Since the first cases were discovered in the U.S., I kept imagining the coronavirus as an irradiating purple light lancing through the cracks of our white-supremacist world. Some of us never noticed these cracks before, but now it is all that we can see. African-Americans and Latinos are dying in higher proportions than anyone else in New York City, perhaps because of their lack of access to health care and because many of them are essential workers and can’t shelter at home. But systemic racism keeps minorities separated. **White supremacy ensures that once the pressure of persecution is lifted even a little from one group, that group will then fall upon the newly targeted group out of relief and out of a frustrated misplaced rage that can never touch, let alone topple, the real enemy.**"

Obama's pandemic team had prepared a full-fledged plan to deal with a sudden pandemic - which Trump proceeded to completely ignore - for reasons.

A key part of the pandemic response team was also to have personnel in foreign CDC's, to allow the U.S. to have early warning, and to fight diseases early at the source (rather than only after they get to the U.S.) as they did successfully for Ebola. Guess who fired the U.S. personnel stationed in China?

And in the end, the point of the pandemic response team is not to be doing stuff when there's no pandemic, but to be ready to respond quickly and without delay when a pandemic did happen - because even a delay of a few weeks could cause tens of thousands or more deaths. The Trump Administration ended up being confused, and dallied for months by not following the procedures developed by the Obama administration."

Like governors across the country, Steve Bullock is leading his state’s public health efforts, but that won’t guarantee him a spot in the U.S. Senate.

By Madelaine Pisani 

While governors across the country have been leading the fight to keep a national pandemic at bay, one governor will have a second career-defining item on his agenda this year: ousting one of his state’s senators.

Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock’s unique role as the only sitting governor running for Senate during the coronavirus pandemic lets him highlight his leadership credentials in the context of a public-health crisis that rises beyond partisan politics. While that dynamic may boost him in some ways, opponent Sen. Steve Daines still has the advantage of incumbency, which means Bullock must translate his profile into enough motivation to unseat a sitting Republican senator in a state that President Trump will likely carry again after winning it by 20 points in 2016.

However, Bullock, who served a term as Montana’s attorney general before moving into the governor’s mansion in 2012, is banking on the Treasure State’s history of ticket splitting—Bullock won reelection by 4 points with Trump on the ballot in 2016, after all.

But Bullock’s past races have either been reelections or open-seat races.

“I know and like all the people that Steve Bullock has run against in general elections. None of them are as popular as Steve Daines,” said Daines pollster Erik Iverson.

In a February poll conducted by the University of Montana, 43 percent of likely voters said Daines was doing an excellent or good job, while 57 percent rated it fair or poor. In the same poll, 46 percent rated Bullock’s job performance as excellent or good, while 54 percent rated it fair or poor.

""It's harder for senators and Congress people. You're not going to see their job ratings jump—I don't think—like you've seen governors',"" said Democratic pollster John Anzalone, whose firm works with several governors, including Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Roy Cooper of North Carolina.

However, Daines is betting that his incumbency and steady approval ratings will still make it an uphill climb for Bullock.

“He could be the nicest guy in the world and everybody can think that he's super bipartisan, and he got all these things done in the legislature,” Iverson said. “But at the end of the day, why are they going to toss out a United States senator who agrees with them on the vast majority of the issues?”

The Bullock campaign will highlight his familiarity in-state and record of working across the aisle. “It is safe to assume that part of what you will hear from this campaign is his ability to work with both parties to improve the lives of Montanans,” said Bullock campaign adviser Matt McKenna.

Daines has also been highlighting his own leadership. In a series of telephone town halls, for example, he explains Congress’s coronavirus-relief package for constituents who call in with questions. The virtual events also give him an opportunity to tout the benefits that his politicking brought to the state. But at the end of the day, Bullock is the decision maker in school closings, social-distancing guidelines, and expanding support for the unemployed, which means his name ID and approval ratings are likely to rise with the tide of governors across the country.

Still, it will be imperative come November for the Democrat to find a specific pocket of Republicans who prefer him to his opponent. Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, who won reelection in 2018, leaned on his ties with the agriculture community from his background as a farmer to build a coalition of voters who usually vote Republican. For Bullock, his cross-party coalition may be the law enforcement community, given his experience as the state’s attorney general.

Daines closed out the fourth quarter of 2019 with more than $5 million in the bank after raising $1.4 million over three months. Bullock’s campaign announced that he raised $1.2 million in the 24 hours after he launched his bid. Unlike states with expensive media markets such as Texas and California, $1 million goes a long way to keep campaign ads on the air in Montana.

“I don't think fundraising is going to be intimidating to either campaign,” Iverson said. “We expect Bullock to have all the money that he’ll ever need, and Daines is going to have all the money he'll ever need. … We’re going to have two political heavyweights slugging this thing out.”

The race will come down to which candidate can make his narrative more dominant than the other’s.

Daines will position himself as a consistent and principled conservative “whose political ideology is more closely aligned with the political ideology of the electorate,” Iverson said. The campaign will contrast that to what Iverson called Bullock’s move “toward the left in order to run for president.”

Republicans believe that Bullock is not the same candidate he was when he ran for governor in 2012 and 2016. GOP operatives will align him with Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi—likely citing Bullock’s September decision to support House Democrats’ push to impeach the president.

For Democrats, it’s all about keeping the narrative local.

“If this race is about Montana, in Montana, they know they lose,” McKenna said. “Their only hope is to make it about a bunch of people who don’t live here"

A one-and-a-half-year later (his demise + way before this pandemic) I happened to read on two articles regarding two seemingly not-too-connected subjects.

**US State Department's Compliance Report** **on China regarding Biological Weapons Convention** — \[[LINK](https://www.state.gov/2019-adherence-to-and-compliance-with-arms-control-nonproliferation-and-disarmament-agreements-and-commitments-compliance-report/)\] Go to the page linked and click ""2019 August Unclassified Compliance Report"" and see p45.

As you can see, the US Department of State reported on August 2018, under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), Country Assessments, That

""People's Republic of China (China): Information indicates that the People’s Republic of China (China) engaged during the reporting period in biological activities with potential dual-use applications, which raises concerns regarding its compliance with the BWC. In addition, the United States does not have sufficient information to determine whether China eliminated its assessed biological warfare (BW) program, as required under Article II of the Convention.""

""The United States has compliance concerns with respect to Chinese military medical institutions’ toxin research and development because of the potential dual-use applications and their potential as a biological threat. In addition, the United States assesses that China possessed an offensive BW program from the early 1950s to at least the late 1980s. There is no available information to demonstrate that China took steps to fulfill its treaty obligations under Article II of the BWC, which requires China to destroy or to divert to peaceful purposes all items specified in Article I of its past offensive BW program.""

**Then,**

when I read the following article, I was wondering why their exercise concerned a respiratory disease, specifically ""a new type of coronavirus."" It was September, not December. For the record, September's average high & low temperature of Wuhan city is 82°F and 70°F. \[[LINK](https://weatherspark.com/y/128408/Average-Weather-in-Wuhan-China-Year-Round)\]

Eng. Title ""The opening of the special passages at the airport for the Military Games will usher in the intensive entry of competition equipment"" (I forgot to get the help from a Taiwanese colleague for this Eng. title. It's purely translated by Google.)

From the article:

>On Sep 18, 2019, the joint unit of [Wuhan Customs](http://www.customs.gov.cn/wuhan_customs/index/index.html)' executive committee and [PLA SOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Special_Operations_Forces) held an emergency training exercise called, ""Guarding the National Security and the Safety of Military Transport,"" at Wuhan Tianhe International Airport. .... The exercise was focused on the definitive course of disposing **a new type of coronavirus** infection found in the airport passages.

The article translated by Google + a help from a Taiwanese colleague tells me one interesting thing: These politburo who drafted said article used the phrase ""a new type of coronavirus (the novel coronavirus).""

Dr. Li Wenliang, a physician & ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, and Dr. Ai Fen, the director of the emergency department, didn't use said phrase or expression at first when they encountered the patient: Those two medical doctors used the phrase ""SARS coronavirus"" when they spread the message for the first time, because they didn't know it was a new type but thought it was a SARS. \[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Wenliang)\]  \[[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20200206144253/http://www.bjnews.com.cn/feature/2020/01/31/682076.html)\]  \[[3](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-wuhan-doctor-ai-fen-speaks-out-against-authorities)\]

(By the way, Dr. Ai Fen is missing. Reporters Without Borders (Reporters Sans Frontières or RSF) on Apr 11 called on the Chinese government ""to urgently clarify the situation of Dr. Ai Fen."" \[[LINK](https://web.archive.org/web/20200411172955/https://rsf.org/en/news/whistleblowing-doctor-missing-after-criticizing-beijings-coronavirus-censorship)\])

>“There was an early cover up in Wuhan, perhaps a few days to a week, before the threat was accepted. We will never know if faster action in those first days could have averted the outbreak,” said Ian Jones, professor of biomedical sciences at Reading University.

Ok, my problem isn’t that you didn’t link an article which said “china covered it up at first,” my problem was that you haven’t explained **how** they covered it up, as in what did they do that would count as covering it up. The “punishing those that raised the alarm” obviously refers to Li Wienlang, which shows how faulty this idea of covering the virus up is. Dr. Li made a false statement in a Wechat group (“there were seven cases of SARS”) at the time that the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission was *already investigating* an outbreak of unknown pneumonia (which was started Dec. 29, a day before Dr. Li’s Wechat statements, and two days before China notified WHO) which would turn out in January to be a novel coronavirus. He was asked not to spread false rumors, issued a letter of warning, and went back to work. 

Why do you ignore the health professionals which notified the govt through the proper channels to make the virus known? Do you even know who Zhang Jixian is? I simply do not see how China covered anything up, they have been extremely fast and open."

* NOTE: This graph is a LOG scale - where exponential growth looks like a straight line. The real numbers are more scary. However, if the exponential growth slows, it should be more obvious on a log scale. Here's the same chart in linear scale: https://imgur.com/a/CBNndpE

* *I want to bring your attention to a site which is presenting a lot of graphs more elegantly and effectively than some of my own crude attempts. For example, it is much easier to see the current rate of exponential growth, and the double-log chart I was attempting is far superior. That and much more - I highly recommend it! Please check it out here: https://advaithasabnis.github.io/covid19/ *

* There was an excellent post a week or so ago showing a better way to graph to detect the improvement from exponential growth here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/fqxgi7/how_to_tell_if_were_beating_covid19/ . My attempt at graphing this model is here (but I may retire this graph soon, it's better done by the link above, including some provinces): https://imgur.com/a/65DjpQt
* Here are some other graphs I'm playing with (MultiTrends): https://imgur.com/a/8io82ws

* Canadian data from virihealth.com (from PHAC & provinces), USA data from coronavirus.1point3acres.com, Other national data was from WHO sitrep 84.
* I am not an epidemiologist. I'm not a government employee. I don't even play a doctor on TV. I just like numbers.

This data is admittedly imperfect: testing is incomplete, there is a test backlog, and reporting is not completely fluid.  This is too simplistic a model for realistic projection, given all of the unknowns and variables of such a complex system.  That said, I'll continue to track this, to see where it goes.

Today's data notes:  

* Nationally, 1863 are hospitalized (+85 from yesterday), and 575 are in ICU (+6). These are both new highs. As these numbers climb, the burden on our healthcare workers will increase. Godspeed and thanks to them as they stand on guard for thee and me. 
* 63 deaths today: 32 in QC, 17 in ON, 11 in BC. The national total is 780 (3.04% of known positives. This is a little high, but we've had a lot of senior care homes hit. Also, this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed).
* People tested (+17,485) = 444,671 (1.18% of the population). This is up 2K from yesterday.
* Tested positive (+1297) = 25,680 (5.78% of those tested). The cumulative hit rate climbs slightly from 5.71% yesterday, rising 20 days in a row. The higher hit rate is concerning, particularly in QC(10.3% overall, 14.8% today) and ON (7.0% overall, 8.17% today). More testing must be done to improve confidence in the latest numbers of positives. 
* Test backlog - 4530 today, up  from 4309 yesterday. 
* Recovered (+586) = 7758 (30.21% of known positives). AB passes 50% recovered (of known positives) today, despite 81 new cases, joining  NL, SK, NB, PEI, BC and YT. Nice! However, this proportion could regress for anyone with incoming positives. Even PEI at 92% recovered has not had 2 infection cycles without a new case, and with silent transmission, I don't know what criteria would be required for an ""all clear"" signal. 
* Known active = 17,142 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). The unknowns are unknown. 
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.
* The growth rate appears in cases seems to be slowing. Higher doubling time is better. March16 - doubling rate= every 2.84 days; March23=2.74 days; Mar30=4.21 days; Apr6=8.19 days. Currently over 10 days. Curve is flattening, but not flat. 
* World notes: Turkey rises another +5K cases today to nearly 57K. UK leads Euro deaths today with 737. Russia up 2.5K to 18K. Plague Inc fans: Madagascar has 104 cases and Greenland has 11."

""Thornley said the risk to most working people was low and likened it, for most people, to a seasonal influenza virus.""

Okay Thornley - Does seasonal influenza overwhelm the most robust healthcare systems in the world in a matter of weeks? Does seasonal influenza shutdown a large portion of the world in a matter of weeks? I'm fairly certain it doesn't and we are also seeing far more ""healthy"" people die then seasonal influenza.

From the WHO ""Covid-19 coronavirus is 10 times more deadly than swine flu"". Correct me if I am wrong but wasn't this flu even deadlier then the normal flu.

I'm just a nobody with no experience in healthcare but even I can see following this plan is a disaster waiting to happen and I am disappointed these people (mostly academics it seems) are calling for this as it's not what we need right now. It almost seems like they have their own agenda - something to do with University numbers possibly overseas students?

I'm all for opening the economy up as this is also essential however we have to do it right. Going to level 3 makes sense, especially for some regions however losing everything we have gained over the past few weeks seems ridiculous to even consider now."

Nobody planned for this and business interruption insurance won’t cover it. If this was a slowdown like in 2008/2009, where it happened over time, then I would agree it isn’t a root cause. But this stopped us all dead in our tracks. Especially because it is happening just coming off of winter when work tends to pick up. Many businesses survive winter by using reserves / emergency fund with the intention of work getting going again. When that suddenly didn’t happen, well, here we are. We all know this. 

We all know that CV fucked up everything. Nobody wants workers in their house. It’s so bad where I live in WA that I was supposed to move out of my current rental at the end of March but nobody will even show me their empty rental homes! So yeah, work unfortunately isn’t going to happen in the trades unless it’s an emergency. But some people like to get on here and be like well, you didn’t do this and that, and you didn’t have this, and lecture as if they feel somehow superior because their business hasn’t been impacted. Sorry to use your post for my rant but I’m sick of people acting like this is the business owners faults. You cannot plan for a global pandemic, and this isn’t as if the business is going under because the poor guy lost one job and he should have been able to skate through that. This is all the jobs, overnight. Nobody should be lecturing anyone right now. So thanks for what you said because this virus IS the root cause."

It will be interesting to see if this flattens our curve in NJ... although we will see a peak initially because the old test took more than 7 days to come back and the cases were really backed up... all the numbers from NJ are probably 2-3 weeks lagged (if we factor in the incubation period of 5-14 days)."

Everytime I see ""mass serological testing"" I think ""it better be nearly 100% specific or we shouldn't really be making too much out of it"". 

For those unaware: how ""specific"" a serological test is refers to how well able it is to *specifically* detect a particular antibody. So in this case we want a high specificity so 100% of the time the antibodies it's detecting are against SARS-COV-2 and not, say, some other human coronavirus (like the ones that cause the common cold). If the test is only 90% specific, that SOUNDS good but that means that, on average, 10% of the results will be false positives. 

So in other words, early in a pandemic, it's really not good to use serological testing unless the specificity is very very high and that's not commonly (if ever?) the case early on. 

This is a GREAT article on why one recent German round of serological testing's results are basically useless: https://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/2020-04/heinsberg-studie-coronavirus-hendrik-streeck-storymachine-kai-diekmann

Christian Drosten (a world leader in novel coronaviruses) basically says “these laboratory tests have a high rate of false positive signals”. 

So yeah, massive grain of salt for all of these early serological surveys. Self-selection bias is also a problem, as is extrapolating from a local population to the population as a whole."

Next, is how meals are being serviced, for many ocean liners, food are served in a buffet service layout, which encourage mingling different the passengers and since this disease has the potential of spreading via fomites (contaminated surfaces), sharing of common utensils can further spread the virus.

I would write this off to testing issues, but the weird pattern persists with the daily number of deaths as well.

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/)

Two weeks ago it looked like their case numbers and deaths had peaked and were receding. But then the next week they had another much larger surge, followed by a hard downturn at the end of the week. This past week saw the same pattern. The downturn always begins on Thursday, and it ends on Sunday night -- so I'm assuming there's a systematic reporting error that hinges around a four day weekend cycle. If this pattern holds, we should expect there will be an even larger (say 30%+) larger surge in deaths and cases starting today.

TL;DR it's possible that Sweden is seeing exactly the same exponential increase that everyone else has seen with this virus, but their data collection is just so noisy it's not possible to be sure."

""No one even thinks about that"" because it's not a smart comparison to make.

You're presumably using [this link](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) from the CDC for the number of raw deaths caused by the flu annually, and since you used the upper bound for the deaths we'll use the upper bound for flu cases as well, which is 45 million.

60k divided by 45m gives us a mortality rate of 0.13% for the flu.

Using [this CDC link](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html), there have been 555k cases of COVID-19 in the US, and 22k deaths. 22k divided by 555k gives us a mortality rate of 3.96% for COVID-19.

If the same number of people who annually get the flu got COVID-19 instead, that would be 45m \* 0.0396, which equals out to 1.78m dead Americans. 

I'm going to type that out again with the full number. **If COVID-19 was as prevalent as the normal flu, 1,783,000 Americans would die annually**. That should terrify you. This isn't a bullshit agenda, it's reacting appropriately to a huge threat."

All that happen is an entire news organization and anyone who still agrees with that organization loses credibility with them in favor of one man who told them not to listen.

So on one side they have ""proof"" in their mind of a media conspiracy, and one man who they trust to tell thek which media is lying. So when they find another news source lying its status quo and easily believable because in their minds they can either accept that everytime they believed him before they shouldn't have, or he was simply right about the media one more time.

E a chi si è lasciato il compito di valutare le deroghe? Ai prefetti. Non agli assessorati alla salute, non agli uffici igiene, non alla medicina del lavoro, non ai sindacati, ma ai rappresentanti del governo sui territori. Con quale capacità o criterio di valutazione? Soltanto in Emilia-Romagna le deroghe sono state 28.000. Chi ha controllato che quelle imprese garantissero le tutele sanitarie ai lavoratori? Oltretutto, mentre la prefettura valutava il da farsi, quella fabbrica comunque non chiudeva. In dubio, pro domino.

I think this proves you can be young, healthy, fit, thin, and active and still catch Coronavirus and die from it.

One month ago today there were 50 Americans who had died from Coronavirus. Now there is 22,948 American deaths.

The death count is getting closer to the low end of the Flu deaths at the CDC website which is 24,000. 

Back in February, the head of the CDC admitted to Congress that some Flu cases and deaths were actually Coronavirus. 

Coronavirus is not a hoax. It’s real. It’s not the Flu. Young people, and everyone needs to take this seriously. No one currently knows what the long term effects are if you do recover. If you do recover with no long lasting side effects, or never catch it, awesome. But you can still be a carrier and have no symptoms and infect others.

I believe one of the key issues with the handling of this disease was that I think we treated it like other viruses we were used to, namely SARS and influenza. These viruses have short incubation periods, and almost always display easily-distinguishable symptoms in infected people, for example, patients with SARS generally had a high fever. That's why a lot of the measures that were implemented early on, like temperature-taking measures and wearing a mask only when you're sick, which makes sense for these other viruses, simply didn't have the same effectiveness when it came to the coronavirus."

While every case obviously can’t be traced, those that have been traced point overwhelmingly to the idea that it transmits in a similar fashion to other respiratory viruses. 

Here’s what the CDC has to say:

>	Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.  

>	Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness. Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission.

>	The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. This includes between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. However, it’s always critical to follow the 4 key steps of food safety—clean, separate, cook, and chill – to prevent foodborne illness.  

Bottom line — worry about the delivery contact, not the food being delivered."

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200317175442.htm

“The scientists found that the RBD portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins had evolved to effectively target a molecular feature on the outside of human cells called ACE2, a receptor involved in regulating blood pressure. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was so effective at binding the human cells, in fact, that the scientists concluded it was the result of natural selection and not the product of genetic engineering.

This evidence for natural evolution was supported by data on SARS-CoV-2's backbone -- its overall molecular structure. If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness. But the scientists found that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone differed substantially from those of already known coronaviruses and mostly resembled related viruses found in bats and pangolins.

‘These two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin for SARS-CoV-2’ said Andersen.”"

In practice, that is not happening. I have encountered numerous pedestrians on the bike paths. Part of the problem is it always takes a while for people to readjust from the winter when only the bike trail is plowed and used by pedestrians and cyclists. Also, there many ”new” users of the trail system, because of the situation, that don't understand the rules and culture. This leads to bikers wanting to use the closed road. Hence the confusion."

Where do you get your information from? It does not matter if an individual carries antibodies to a particular virus. They can still be a vehicle for transmission. If the individual comes in contact with the virus in public, they can easily transmit it to surfaces in the home (doorknobs, fridge doors, countertops, etc.) Just because you have an antibody, it does not mean there is a sudden protective shield around your whole body.

Secondly, there is no evidence that recovering from COVID-19 will grant immunity. There are already three strains of the virus in circulation around the globe (A, B, and C), and viruses can rapidly mutate. South Korea has reported 91 cases of reinfection of COVID-19. The cause is under investigation. The current speculation is that the virus went dormant and then reactivated.

This type of misinformation is what is going to lead to more people becoming ill. Please take the extra five minutes to research what you think to be true before you spread it around the internet.

>Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump fueled more speculation about the future of Dr. Anthony Fauci on Sunday, retweeting a conservative who called for the top infectious disease specialist to be fired after he said in a CNN interview more could have been done to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

>Amid sustained criticism of Fauci from some of the President's allies in conservative media, the message raised the prospect of Trump potentially souring on a key member of his coronavirus task force.

>Trump's initial handling of the crisis has come under increasing scrutiny as it's been revealed that administration and health officials were sounding alarms for weeks before Trump took decisive actions such as calling for social distancing measures.

>Trump has disputed that his administration was slow to respond and has called for the economy to be reopened quickly, potentially by the beginning of May, despite health officials' warnings that doing so could risk a resurgence.

>Fauci conceded to CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday morning that earlier mitigation efforts could have saved more lives and again called for a cautious reopening of the nation, despite Trump's calls to quickly restart the economy.

>""I mean, obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives,"" Fauci, said on ""State of the Union"" when asked if social distancing and stay-at-home measures could have prevented deaths had they been put in place in February, instead of mid-March.

>""Obviously, no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those decisions is complicated,"" added Fauci, who is a key member of the Trump administration's coronavirus task force. ""But you're right, I mean, obviously, if we had right from the very beginning shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.""

>Hours later, Trump retweeted a user who said it was ""Time to #FireFauci"" and praised Trump's decision to issue travel restrictions against China in early February. Fauci has praised the President's decision to implement travel restrictions abroad in Europe and in China, telling reporters last month the move ""absolutely has"" mitigated cases in the US.

>The White House did not comment on Trump's retweet.

>Polling friends

>Trump spent part of the Easter weekend calling allies and associates complaining about recent media coverage of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, people familiar with the conversations said.

>Trump believes ""everybody is trying make themselves look good,"" said one source, who claimed Trump has been fixated on two government officials at the center of the response: Fauci and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.

>""He's been fretting about Fauci for a while,"" the source said of Trump's focus on the popular public health expert, summing up Trump's comments about the doctor as ""why isn't Fauci saying nice things about me?""

>But Trump has also wavered on Azar, who has been the subject of speculation for weeks after he was sidelined from leading the coronavirus task force. Trump believes Azar's aides were partly behind a scathing weekend New York Times article on Trump's response to the virus, the source said, and Trump is particularly frustrated with criticism he could have acted sooner.

>As for Fauci, the source said Trump is clearly trying to make the doctor uncomfortable, a tactic he uses with many of his top officials. Some in the President's circle -- including conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh have been criticizing Fauci and painting the doctor as somehow aligned with the Clintons.

>The tweet retweeted by Trump suggested that Fauci mistakenly downplayed the initial threat of coronavirus to the US in late February when he said the ""country as a whole ... still remains at low risk,"" though the infectious disease expert was referring specifically to an outbreak in Washington state and qualified that ""this is an evolving situation.""

>Fauci did, however, tell radio host John Catsimatidis in late January that coronavirus ""isn't something the American public needs to worry about or be frightened about,"" adding, ""because we have ways of preparing and screening"" those coming from countries impacted by the virus.

>LISTEN: The Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction Podcast

>The relationship between Fauci, who has served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and Trump has been the subject of widespread speculation. Trump last month praised Fauci for being ""so professional,"" but at a White House briefing earlier this month, he refused to let Fauci answer a question about the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which Trump has repeatedly touted as a potential treatment for coronavirus despite Fauci's caution.

>In meetings, Fauci isn't hesitant to offer unvarnished thoughts or analysis even when it seems to contradict the President. He's previously warned the speed of developing a coronavirus vaccine isn't nearly where Trump has suggested it could be and he's cautioned that the possible treatments Trump touts in public haven't yet proved effective.

>Frank public disagreements between Trump and a top official are virtually unprecedented in his administration. Earlier in the crisis, Trump grew enraged when an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested the situation would worsen badly in the United States, believing her assessment overly fatalistic.

>Blunt candor hasn't always endeared Fauci to Trump either; the President has complained in private when it seems he's being contradicted by the nation's top infectious disease specialist. But Trump has also said he prefers the direct approach.

>Fauci described the challenges of working with Trump in an interview with the journal Science last month. Asked how he responds to falsehoods from the President during press conferences, Fauci said, ""I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down,"" according to the interview.

>""OK, he said it. Let's try and get it corrected for the next time,"" Fauci said.

>Allies push to discredit experts

>As conversations intensify in the White House about how and when to give guidance to reopen the country, the President is talking more and more to friends from Wall Street, hedge fund managers and others in the financial world pressuring him to put a specific date on the calendar for when businesses can reopen -- and to do it soon, according to a person familiar with the President's conversations.

>Meanwhile, the President's allies in conservative media have begun waging a campaign to discredit some on his team as narrowly focused on charts and models rather than the economic pain inflicted on millions of Americans.

>Limbaugh, the conservative radio host whom Trump awarded a surprise Medal of Freedom during this year's State of the Union address, called Fauci a ""Clinton sympathizer"" on his program last week. Tucker Carlson, whose intervention in early March helped Trump take the outbreak more seriously, said on his Fox program Fauci had been ""wrong repeatedly.""

>When Trump initially decided Easter was the date he hoped to have the country open again, it caught some aides off guard and was not based on any data-focused discussions.

>Officials, realizing it was unrealistic, slowly tried to get the President to back off that timeline by showing him models that projected thousands of dead and polling that showed Americans favored keeping the restrictions back in place.

>""That was just an aspiration. That would have been incredible,"" Trump said last week. ""But I don't think we're going to be very far behind.""

>Now, there is no similarly concerted effort underway to convince Trump to ease up on the May timeline for reopening the country, people familiar with the matter said.

>White House officials have insisted Trump has confidence in Fauci. Last Friday, Trump defended his medical experts at the coronavirus task force press conference after they came under fire from some conservative pundits. But he stopped short of telling his allies to cease their political attacks on Fauci and the other top doctor on the task force, Deborah Birx.

>Trump said he has ""tremendous respect"" for the doctors and ""I'm never saying bad about these people."" He also said ""I will certainly listen"" when asked if he would listen to Fauci and Birx if they told him the country is not ready to reopen by May 1.

>A separate Trump adviser tried to explain Trump's weekend retweet, saying the President often retweets posts on Twitter without reading the entire tweet.

>""You guys assume he reads tweets before he retweets,"" the adviser said. ""He doesn't.""

>CNN's Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report."

Lord Sugar: Your task this week is simple, sell as many face masks as you can, whichever team sells most wins the task.

\*Later on back in the boardroom\*

Lord Sugar: Karen, how many did Team Hubristic sell?

Karen: Well Lord Sugar... Team Hubristic did rather well, they managed to sell 44,000 masks.

Lord Sugar: Very good, and Claude, how many did Team Conceited sell?

Claude: Well they didn't do quite so well, they only managed to sell 14.

Lord Sugar: fourteen thousand?

Claude: No, fourteen.

Lord Sugar: 14?  You only managed to sell 14 bloody masks?  In the middle of a pandemic?

Contestant: Lord Sugar, if I may, it wasn't my fau...

Lord Sugar: You shut up, this is a bloody shambles, give me one good reason why I shouldn't fire the lot of you?

Contestant 2: Lord Sugar, the planning of this task was diabolical, all the fault lies with the PM, I said we should try and sell to the private hospitals and care homes but he didn't listen, he doesn't listen to anyone, he had us traipsing around every pub in London because apparently his mate makes a fortune going pub to pub selling counterfeit cigarettes and DVDs ... it was a terrible idea.

PM: That's a lie, he never suggested going to the hospitals, and when I came up with the idea of selling the masks in pubs all the team were all onboard, they all thought it was a great idea, not one of them had any objections.  And it was a good idea, it was just a shame all the pubs in London were closed, otherwise we would have made a killing.

Lord Sugar: Did you lose one of your last 2 braincells during this pandemic or something? 

PM: The strategy was good Lord Sugar, it wasn't our fault the pubs were shut, and when it got to 4pm we realised we only had an hour left so I made the executive decision to sell on the streets. If it weren't for me we wouldn't have sold any!  

Lord Sugar: I think I need to put one of those masks on to cover the smell of bloody bullshit in this room!  And you're very quiet Contestant 3.  It says here on your CV that you could sell ice to the Eskimos.  Well I can tell you this for nothing, that's a bloody lie.  What have you got to say for yourself?

Contestant 3: I've never sold face masks before Lord Sugar, I'm used to selling fashion accessories, like hats and scarves, selling masks is completely different to what I'm used to... I was out of my comfort zone I admit.... but give me one more shot and I'll prove to you I've got what it takes to be your apprentice.

Lord Sugar: You're a liability.  I've heard enough now... this is quite frankly the worst performance I've ever seen in the history of this show, and that's saying something.  Incompetent doesn't even cover it.  PM, your strategy was a bigger disaster than the Coronavirus.  Absolute disaster, *complete disaster*, what was going through your head?  And contestant 3, you didn't even manage to sell one mask, and you're supposed to be a bloody master salesman... but PM, I can't get away from the fact that the fault of this task lies with you, you're fired!  The rest of you get out of my sight and go back to the house...  you're a bunch of bloody deadbeats!

2020-04-13,Fuehit,singapore,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g0vhqw/up_to_70_of_those_infected_may_show_no_symptoms/fnbzc3q/,"**Asymptomatic persons with the coronavirus disease are** [**more common than was previously thought**](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coronavirus-new-study-finds-at-least-10-patients-in-singapore-caught-virus-from)  **- some research says potentially as many as 55 per cent to 70 per cent  of infections - and they can go on to infect others without anyone ever  finding out.**

It is one of three reasons that make Covid-19 such a challenging  disease to tackle, National Centre for Infectious Diseases executive  director Leo Yee Sin told The Straits Times yesterday.

**Another reason is that Covid-19 manifests itself as an innocuous and mild illness, but has high virus secretion at its onset.**

**""This causes infected individuals to misjudge the seriousness of  their illness, and have a tendency to continue routine activities  without realising the danger of spreading the infection,"" she said.**

Third, as Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen, the whole of Singapore is susceptible to it.

**""Any one of us can be infected and, if we are not careful, can serve  as a transmitter passing on the virus to others. When that happens,  those most at risk are the people close to us, such as family members,  colleagues and close friends,"" said Professor Leo.**

She called on people to protect themselves, those around them and the community by being socially responsible.

This  means remaining at home, not paying visits to others and avoiding older  family members, who are most at risk of complications from the disease.

While it was previously unclear if asymptomatic spread is an issue,  this has changed as scientists learn more about the virus. Newer findings now suggest that those who do not display symptoms of the  disease could be spreading it widely without knowing it.

**Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases expert who practises at  Rophi Clinic at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said that studies done  in the United States, China and Italy show that more than half to about  70 per cent of those with Covid-19 are either asymptomatic or have  minimal symptoms, but they can shed the virus for up to four weeks.**

**He said this could mean that circuit breakers may have to be in force  beyond May 4 to really stem disease transmission as these individuals  would need about six weeks (an incubation period of up to 14 days plus  four weeks) to stop being infectious.**

Dr Leong also said the number of asymptomatic persons with Covid-19  here would add to herd immunity, but there had to be a large enough  infected population for herd immunity to be acquired.

""At this rate, it could take at least two to three years for that to happen,"" he said.

People should instead adhere to the strict circuit breaker measures  in place to curtail such potentially widespread community transmissions.

Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, programme leader of the infectious  diseases programme at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee  Hock School of Public Health, said people who do not show symptoms  throughout their infection would escape detection.

However, it is known that a significant proportion of such  asymptomatic infections exists because of the extensive testing done on  cruise ships such as the Diamond Princess and in countries such as  Iceland, South Korea and Germany, and when work and family clusters are  investigated, including in China.

""We know from work by MOH (Ministry of Health) that pre-symptomatic  transmission of the virus can occur, and this is possibly also true from  asymptomatic cases,"" said Prof Hsu.

There have now been almost 3,000 cases of Covid-19 here.

An article in the medical journal BMJ noted that around four in five coronavirus infections in China cause no illness.

On April 1, China [began publishing daily figures ](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-reports-36-new-coronavirus-cases-130-asymptomatic-cases)on  the number of new asymptomatic coronavirus cases. Its National Health  Commission reported that about 78 per cent, or 130, of 166 new  infections identified in the 24 hours to the afternoon of April 1 were  asymptomatic.

The top US infectious diseases expert, National Institute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, also noted about a week  ago that rough estimates indicate that about 25 per cent to 50 per cent  of those with Covid-19 may not show any symptoms. It is also why masks  or face coverings are now advised so that people can use them to block  the droplets that escape from their mouths when they talk or exhale.

**What is also now clear about the disease is that it is highly  infectious at the start, when a person has yet to show symptoms or is  showing very mild symptoms. This means he can make others very sick when  he is only mildly ill.**

**This is contrary to common sense thinking to stay away from others  only when someone is very sick, and is one of the reasons the  authorities have called for the public to stay home.**"

Using the particular pseudovirus the authors use here as an example, in this case the simplified version is that it was made by putting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (the coronavirus surface protein that facilitates both entry into the cell and 'fusion': the virus releasing its interior payload of genetic material into the cell) as well as a gene that will report if the virus has entered the cell: a luciferase that glows, onto the same sequence. Then when you force some cells to express that sequence, they produce your pseudovirus: a virus with the outside proteins from SARS-Co-2, but the inside is just a reporter sequence. It is thus incapable of producing more of itself, because the inside of the virus is just the luciferase reporter that has been packaged: not instructions to make more of itself. This is why pseudoviruses get used in the lab: not anywhere near as dangerous as the actual infectious virus because it can only complete a single entry and fusion and then production of a reporter.

The pseudovirus can enter cells using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and subsequently fuse with the cell to release the interior. The luciferase gets expressed, and the cell glows.

That is what the authors did here. It demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can enter T cell lines and fuse with them. The cells then glow.

The authors also try to infect the cells, but don't see a true productive infection. 

A better title would have perhaps been that SARS-CoV-2 enters T lymphocytes, not that it infects them. That is a higher bar to clear beyond the initial entry and fusion. Show me replication of the genome, packaging of new viruses, and release of new viruses before claiming it is infecting the cells. Or, as the authors claim, it could lead to destruction of the cells. Idk, maybe. But these are just the first steps out of many. 

Not to mention these are T cell lines which can be really messed up. Complement the results with some human T cells, they aren't difficult to isolate."""

Most recently, 51 South Koreans with COVID-19 re-tested positive after being released from quarantine. However, a key question South Korean authorities and everywhere else with these “reinfected cases” are now trying to figure out is whether these people did indeed recover and were then re-infected with the virus, or whether they never recovered completely at all.*    

> *Although no conclusions about this immunity question can currently be definitively made, a new preprint study from China suggests that some people who have recovered from a mild bout of COVID-19 may have very low, or even undetectable levels of protective antibodies against the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus, with the researchers claiming that their study is the first systematic examination of antibody levels in people who have recovered from the disease.*  

> *The work was published on preprint server MedRxiv by scientists from Fudan University in Shanghai and has not yet been peer reviewed by external experts, nor accepted for publication in a scientific journal. The study looked at blood samples from 175 patients from Shanghai who had experienced mild cases of COVID-19 and subsequently recovered. They found that almost a third of those who recovered had low levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the virus, with ten patients having no detectable level of the neutralizing antibodies at all.*

If true, this means that there won't be a vaccine, and that people can get this again and again. 

There's no vaccine for the common cold because it mutates so rapidly. I think we will have an HIV vaccine, however it will be long to develop because far too many people still call it the ""gay plague"". Just look at how poorly HPV vaccine rates are in the US (it even prevents several cancers) in comparison with other countries (Australia has gone for a 100% teenager HPV vaccination campaign). Too many people in the US believe that there should be some punishment for sex: pregnancy, marriage or some other disease. 

Normally, for most viruses, your immune system learns to recognize the virus and develops anti-bodies. The original discoverer of vaccination was [Jenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Jenner) in 1796 when he demonstrated that people who got [cowpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowpox) (which had a fatality rate near 0%) never got smallpox (which had a fatality rate over 30%)."

Come il fatto che non sono riusciti a contenere la pandemia e/o che si è generata per colpa della poca igiene in certi luoghi cinesi. Quindi meglio il silenzio. 

Non credo (spero almeno) sia un tentativo di incolpare qualcun altro ma semplicemente di far evitare che certe notizie escano in Cina.

Spain has already overcome the peak of the coronavirus epidemic and will now focus on bending the infection curve, according to Health Minister Salvador Illa.

“We’ve reached the peak of the epidemic and the goal we have this week is to consolidate the second stage and bend the curve” of infections, Illa said Monday in a news conference.

With 3,477 new cases detected over the last 24 hours, Spain reported Monday the lowest number of new infections since March 20, as well as a decrease in its death toll.

There's no guarantee of a vaccine.  We don't know if we can create one for a coronavirus and even if we do, we don't know how long the immunity will last.  Hopefully we can create one, but right now it isn't guaranteed.

The gov before few weeks opened importing of wheat for private business men because gov can’t buy anymore

Thats one of the reasons of the bread chaos, those traders buy by themselves and sell in expensive prices way higher than gov official price

There were some rumors that gov wanted the traders to buy in Syrian lira to stabilize the currency but traders refused since the lira can fall again and it will affect them “that’s why some completely refused to import” but that got resolved I think

Sure.

January 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

February 2: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

February 25: “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 7: “We’ll hold tremendous rallies...I’m not concerned at all.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on coronavirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

March 9: So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that! (from a tweet)

March 10: ""Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary!""

March 13: ""To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!""

March 13: ""Today I am declaring a national emergency. Two very big words.""

March 13. ""No, I don't take responsibility at all. Because we were given a set of circumstances, given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time. It wasn't meant for this kind of an event, with the kind of numbers that we are talking about.""

March 13. ""We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act ... I have it memorized, practically, as to the powers in that act. And if I need to do something, I'll do it. I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.""

March 15: “This is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible. But it’s something we have tremendous control over.”

March 16: “We’re going to win. And I think we’re going to win faster than people think — I hope. On a scale from 1-10, I rate my response as a 10.”

March 17: “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.”"

You're absolutely right, though. The few videos leaked of people screaming at government officials from just inside their front doors, crying and freaking out in the street because there's a sick person in their home that's too old for the government to care enough to transport out to the hospital, putting the rest of the family at risk, the government propaganda posters ALL over (all those huge red banners with white Mandarin text in the background all over Wuhan), the government seizing and controlling the entire supply of PPE and only distributing it as they see fit, and price gouging from their own constituents and so many other human rights atrocities made the quarantine ending possible.

His policies do somewhat well, but still are less popular than Biden’s plans.

As more information comes out, the sexual assault allegations are looking less like Christine Blasey Ford and more like Jacob Wohl’s Mueller accusers. The only media orgs who are pushing it are fringe left tabloids, and the media organizations that actually have thorough vetting processes are unable to verify most of the claims.

The dementia allegation was probably the grossest thing to come out of this primary tbh. Like Biden has said, a stutter is the only disability you’re still allowed to laugh at, and apparently it’s also fair game to smear political opponents over it too.

All it would take is for the western states to get pissed enough at something that Trump does or doesn't do, and they can easily threaten to come up with a way to make it so that the flow of taxes goes through the states first before heading to DC.

This is different.

After 9/11, popular punditry told of a ""Clash of Civilizations"" between ""the West"" and Islam (even though Islam, being Abrahamic in origin, *is* a Western religion). That ""Clash"" never happened. I knew plenty of Muslims growing up— the only clashing between us occurred in Magic cards.

9/11 was class warfare. A bored, wealthy manchild who fell into religious derangement murdered a bunch of middle-class office workers. And then, American rich people found ways to turn the catastrophe into money. It didn't ""look like"" class war at the time because even rich people (here, at least) hated OBL, but it was class war— some rich cunt thought his religious extremism gave him the right to murder three thousand of the little people.

In the early 21st-century Fourth Turning, the upper class and its (mostly one-sided) class warfare against us is the problem to be solved.

The coronavirus is bad, but it doesn't have to be civ-killer bad. South Korea has it under control (for now). It would have maxed out around 30,000 dead, were it not for plutocrats demanding ""the resources"" stay at work as long (and get back to work as soon) as possible.

Many enthusiast vehicles are selling for more now than they were 6 months ago, just because people have nothing to do but sit at home and shop.

I think that once the reality sets in, we will see a drop in price, but I haven't seen the price drops following the demand. What I DO think will happen is that in 3-5 years, we will see used prices staying high, because we aren't currently selling new cars right now during the coronavirus. And even afterwards, for a year or 3, while people have to claw themselves out of the debt, closing businesses, lost wages, etc. then people will buy fewer new cars. And when people are only buying 10 million cars per year instead of 17 million cars per year, then we have only half as large of a pool for used cars. Which is what made used cars hard to buy from 2010-2015, but of course no one looked at the 25 million new cars that were never sold, that were unable to be turned into used cars."

Maanantain kunniaksi aloitin aamun syömällä puuroa ja jälkiruoaksi gin tonic koska paikalliset puurot eivät vedä vertoja elovenalle.

Lähteinä [AEI](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/), [CAP](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2020/04/03/482613/national-state-plan-end-coronavirus-crisis/) ja [Harvard](https://ethics.harvard.edu/covid-19-response). 

Heti alkuun huonot uutiset: ekonomien paljon toivoma V-käyrä jossa talous nousee räjähdysmäisesti takaisin normaaliksi tuskin toteutuu. Syynä tähän on rokotteen puuttuminen. Kiinassa koronavirus saatiin jotenkin kuriin, Wuhanin rajoitteet poistettiin ja nyt koronavirus on tekemässä [toista tulemista](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/10/asia/china-korea-singapore-coronavirus-second-wave-intl-hnk/index.html). Sama on toistumassa [Etelä-Koreassa](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/south-korea-s-return-normal-interrupted-uptick-coronavirus-cases-n1176021) ja [Singaporessa](https://www.businessinsider.com/singapores-second-wave-shows-us-in-for-loosening-restrictions-2020-4?r=US&IR=T). Käytännössä koronavirus on kuin bemarikuski josta voi pyrkiä pääsemään eroon mutta aina toinen paskiainen löytää tiensä puskuriin.

Pahveissa esitetyt vaihtoehdot eivät juurikaan poikenneet toisistaan vaan ne voidaan tiivistää seuraavanlaisesti

1. Estä pandemian leviäminen tarttuneiden karanteeneilla ja terveiden sosiaalisella eristämisellä jotta terveydenhuolto ei ylikuormitu. Tämä on se kuuluisa [flatten the curve](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/22/science/11SCI-VIRUS-CURVE1/11SCI-VIRUS-TRACKER1-superJumbo.jpg) jota maailma nyt elää.

2. Vaiheessa 2 pyritään talouden ja liikkuvuuden vaiheittaiseen avaamiseen. Tätä on yritetty niin Kiinassa kuin Etelä-Koreassa minkä takia nyt murehditaan miten pahasti korona puree persiiseen toista kertaa. 

Eristyksen avaaminen on välttämätöntä koska talous ei tule kestämään pitkän aikaa näännytyssotaa koronaa vastaan vaan jossain vaiheessa X velkaantuminen sekä rahan painaminen saavuttaa pisteensä. Tämän takia papereissa on esitetty monenlaisia tapoja saavuttaa vaihe 2 jotta voidaan välttää tilanne jossa välillä avataan talous ja sitten mennään taas lukkoon. 

Vaihtoehto 1 on massiivinen testaaminen jossa koko yhteiskunta testataan 2-4 viikon välein. Käytännössä joka päivä tulisi saavuttaa [7 % testikattavuus](https://paulromer.net/covid-sim-part2/) jotta tartunnan saaneiden määrä pysyisi terveydenhuollon resurssien rajoissa. Testauksella pyritään saamaan kattava otanta jotta oireettomat kantajat saadaan heti karanteeniin. Testauksen hyvä puoli on se, että myös false negative-tuloksen antavat testit ovat käytännössä [aina](https://paulromer.net/covid-sim-part3/) parempi vaihtoehto kuin ei testausta ollenkaan mikäli oletamme, että positiivisen tuloksen saaneet eristetään. Tarkoituksena on luoda tilanne jossa reaalitalous voi toimia samalla kun koronaviruksen paluu estetään laajalle testaamisella jotta oireelliset saadaan heti kontrolliin. 

Ongelma on siinä, että maailmassa ei ole kapasiteettia tähän. Esimerkiksi Yhdysvaltojen pitäisi tehdä 22 miljoonaa testiä päivässä ja Suomessa tämä tarkoittaisi 370 000 testiä. Esimerkiksi Suomi ei ole tehnyt samaa määrää koronaviruksen testejä [pandemian aikana](https://www.hs.fi/tiede/art-2000006469060.html) mitä tämä vaihtoehto 1 vaatisi päivässä. Nykyisillä teknologioilla ei tulla pääsemään väestötason kattavuuteen joten [uutta teknologiaa](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.025635v1) tulisi saada nopeasti käyttöön. Samalla pitäisi löytää hoitajia ottamaan joka päivä 370 000 testiä koska näytteenotto analytiikan lisäksi olennaista ja tämä pitää tehdä suojatusti. Samalla sitten lainsäädännöllinen läpikäynti kun pitäisi pohtia mitä tehdä niille jotka eivät enää jaksa ravata testeissä. Oikeuslaitoksella voi olla kiirettä kun ihmiset riitauttavat sakkojansa kun eivät käy koronatesteissä. 

Vaihtoehto 2 on IT-panopticon jossa ihmisiä seurataan puhelintietojen välityksellä. Eli jos joku sairastuu niin tartunketju jäljitetään teletietojen ja kaikki kontaktissa olleet määrätään karanteeniin. Hyvä puoli on se, että tämä ei vaadi väestötason testikattavuutta mutta huono puoli on se, että tämä avaa pandoran lippaan jossa panopticon voi jäljittää aivan kaiken mitä teet jos sinulla on puhelin mukanasi. Käytännössä tällaisen valvontakoneiston toteuttaminen on äärimmäisen riski toimenpide koska tällaisen tietojärjestelmän suunnittelu vaatii äärimmäistä pohdintaa koska tässä mallissa jokainen on pakko voida jäljittää yksilöllisesti. Eli dataa ei voida antaa erinnäisiä yleisinä vektoreina vaan datan on oltava yksilöllistä jotta kaikki tartuntaketjut voidaan jäljittää. 

Samalla pitäisi luoda yksi todella pelottava datakokonaisuus jossa potilastiedot voidaan yhdistää teletietoihin. Esimerkiksi jos on riskiryhmäläinen niin tiedon on välityttävä nopeasti. Tai jos joku tuttava jonka luona on käyty on riskiryhmässä niin kaikki tämä pitää voida jäljittää, yksilöidä ja yhdistää tunnettuihin tietokantoihin potilastiedoista teletietoihin. Käytännössä tämä vaatii merkittävää työmäärää mutta se on mahdollista. Silti herää kysymys siitä, että haluammeko oikeasti antaa Aino-Kaisa Pekosen, Timo Harakan, Sanna Marinin ja Tiedon/CGI:n/Accenturen aloittaa noin massiivinen tietojärjestelmähanke ja mitä tuolla vekottimella tehdään pandemian jälkeen. Käytönnössä se olisi pakko laittaa odottamaan toista pandemiaa jotta varautuminen paranee ja miljadeja ei mene hukkaan. Tämä sillä oletuksella, että poliisihallituksella ei olisi parempaa käyttöä kyseisellä datakokonaisuudelle.

Vaihtoehto 3 on melkolailla nykymalli jossa pyritään testaamaan, eristämään ja seuraamaan rajoitusti televalvonnalla eristäytymisen toimivuutta. Tämä on se ongelmallisin koska nyt saadaan ne huonot puolet ilman hyviä. Datalla ei voida yksilöimättömyyden takia jäljittää tarkasti tartuntaketjuja ja testikattavuus ei riitä jäljittämään koronaa tarpeeksi tarkasti väestötasolla. Käytännössä katsoen tässä mallissa tullaan pomppimaan eristäytymisen, testaamisen ja seurannan välillä toivoen, että korona lopettaisi pikkuhiljaa. Kysymys onkin siitä miten koronan kanssa tasapainotellaan eristäytymisen ja avaamisen kanssa kunnes rokote on valmis. 

Mutta suurin ongelma on miten poliittinen päätöksenteko on kuin rampa ankka. Liittovaltiotason päätöksenteko on Yhdysvalloissa olematonta ja debaatti tuntuu olevan lähinnä siitä milloin kansalaiset uhrataan [talouden takia](https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2020/3/27/21193879/coronavirus-covid-19-social-distancing-economy-recession-depression). Tosin ei Suomessakaan sen paremmin osata kun katsoo miten päätöksenteon pitkän tähtäimen suunnitelmallisuudesta on tehty. Tosin ei käy kateeksi valtioneuvoston asettamaa [valmisteluryhmää](https://valtioneuvosto.fi/artikkeli/-/asset_publisher/10616/valtioneuvoston-kanslia-asetti-8-4-2020-valmisteluryhman-jonka-tehtavana-on-valmistella-nopealla-aikataululla-suunnitelma-suomen-tieksi-ulos-koronakri) jonka tehtävänä on keksiä miten Suomi nousee koronaviruksen jälkeen.

Käytännössä nyt tullaan elämään näännytyssotaa koronaa vastaan jossa tehdään todella kipeitä valintoja kun pohditaan miten korona pidetään aisoissa rokotteeseen asti."

*Consider two important measurement differences: battleground states versus other states, and registered voters versus likely voters.*

By [**Nate Cohn**](https://www.nytimes.com/by/nate-cohn) *|* *April 13, 2020*

President Trump and Joe Biden begin the general election campaign locked in a highly competitive contest that remains fought along the lines of the 2016 presidential election, according to national and battleground state polls.

If anyone holds the early edge, it is Mr. Biden. He leads by an average of six points in national live-interview polls of registered voters. But the election will be decided by voters in the battleground states, not registered voters nationwide, and there the story is not nearly so clear or rosy for Mr. Biden.

At the moment, a reasonable estimate is that Mr. Biden is performing four or five points worse among likely voters in the critical states than he is among registered voters nationwide. As a result, he holds only a narrow and tenuous edge in the race for the Electoral College, if he holds one at all.

Even under ordinary circumstances, with seven months to go until the election, there would be plenty of time for the race to change. This cycle, the country also faces a pandemic and a severe economic downturn with the potential to upend the race.

Already, an initial uptick in the president’s approval rating has dissipated, perhaps because a [rallying effect](https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=39&emc=edit_ty_20200330&instance_id=17183&nl=david-leonhardt&productCode=TY&regi_id=78477479&segment_id=23288&te=1&uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2F1e6ea9e2-49cd-4ce6-85ea-22a661f94fc1&user_id=7007c2443c54618125bbffa1c7f91645) has given way to more focus on the administration’s coronavirus response. There will be many opportunities for the polls to shift again, and the president faces many downside risks without a return to normal life and to economic growth before the election.

But at least for now, the polls suggest that American voters are divided along familiar lines, despite countless events that seemed to have the potential to redraw them.

The president begins the campaign with strong support from the white working class who powered his upset win four years ago. He leads among white voters without a college degree, 61 percent to 32 percent, in an average of live-interview polls conducted since March 15, matching or perhaps even exceeding his margin over Hillary Clinton in methodologically similar polls conducted late in the 2016 campaign.

The results suggest that Mr. Biden, despite his reputed appeal to blue-collar workers, has made little to no progress in winning back the white voters without a college degree who supported Barack Obama in 2012 but swung to Mr. Trump in 2016.

Mr. Biden counters with a wide lead among white voters with a college degree, who support him by a similar or greater margin than they did Mrs. Clinton four years ago. Over all, he leads, 55-40, among that group of registered voters in an average of recent surveys.

Mr. Biden also holds the expected wide advantage among nonwhite voters, though here there is consistent evidence of a small yet discernible shift in the president’s direction, including in the large series of [New York Times/Siena College polls](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/upshot/trump-biden-warren-polls.html) from last November. Mr. Trump, in contrast, seems to do a tick worse among white voters than he did four years ago, whether because of a slight decrease in his standing among college-educated white voters or the growing share of white voters who possess a four-year degree.

As a result, Mr. Trump appears to [retain his relative advantage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/upshot/trump-electoral-college-edge-.html) in the disproportionately white working-class battleground states that decided the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Biden leads in polls of registered voters in these states, but by a narrower margin than he leads nationwide. It raises the possibility that Democrats could win the most votes and lose the White House for the third time in six presidential elections.

Wisconsin, the tipping-point state in 2016, has backed Mr. Biden by just over one percentage point in an average of seven live-interview surveys conducted so far this year, compared with a six-point Biden lead in national surveys over the same period.

Mr. Trump’s relative advantage in the Electoral College, though persistent so far, is not unshakable. To this point, his apparent strength in Wisconsin has tended to expand his Electoral College advantage. But a fairly modest shift in that state or another could expand or contract it.

Arizona and Florida are two possible candidates. White voters without a degree represent a smaller share of the electorate in those states than they do in the Midwest. Arizona polls in particular give Democrats some cause for hope: Mr. Biden has led live-interview polls by four points in Arizona. A breakthrough by Democrats in Arizona would essentially cancel out their weakness in Wisconsin. It would make Pennsylvania, where Mr. Biden leads by about two points, the pivotal state on the electoral map.

One reason for Mr. Biden’s strength in Arizona and Florida might be older voters, who represent an above-average share of white voters in the two states. On average, Mr. Biden leads among voters over age 65 by a margin of 53 percent to 44 percent nationwide, including a lead in every live-interview national poll reporting a result for the group. It is a substantial improvement over Mrs. Clinton’s six-point deficit among the group in pre-election polls in 2016.

Mr. Biden’s early strength among older voters is not easy to explain. It cannot be fully accounted for by the changing composition of each age group, although the ascent of the baby boomers into the oldest age cohort may be part of the reason, along with the gradual departure of the more conservative Silent Generation from the electorate altogether. Mr. Trump seems to have made gains among voters 45 to 65, or perhaps even younger, canceling out his losses among older voters over all.

Mr. Biden’s relative strength among older voters may also help counteract his expected weakness among likely voters, relative to registered voters, when pollsters apply likely-voter screens later in the cycle. In polling, Republicans usually fare about two points better among likely voters than registered voters, who tend to be relatively young and diverse.

This cycle, the coronavirus pandemic raises additional questions about the eventual turnout, particularly if it leads to widespread voting by mail. But no matter the method, Democrats typically find themselves at a turnout disadvantage, and it is doubtful that Mr. Biden will maintain the whole of his current polling advantage among likely voters. Even when Democrats benefited from a surge in turnout in well-educated suburbs during the 2018 midterm elections, Republicans fared better among likely voters than among registered voters.

Together, Mr. Trump’s relative advantage of one to two points among likely voters compared with registered voters — and his relative advantage of three and even four points in the tipping-point states — means that the typical national poll of registered voters is probably around four or five points worse for Mr. Trump than his standing among likely voters in the most pivotal states. Mr. Biden’s already narrow polling lead in states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania or Arizona might be vanishingly small after a likely voter screen.

Of course, no one knows what American life will look like by the time of the election. Perhaps the country will still be in lockdown, saddled by 30 percent unemployment, and convinced that the president’s slow response cost lives and damaged the economy. Or maybe the country will be swept by euphoria as lockdowns are lifted a month or two ahead of the election and a liberated population sends its children to school, visits friends, goes to the park and enjoys double-digit G.D.P. growth in the third quarter.

The pandemic also could change how the election is administered, potentially yielding a novel turnout that’s impossible to predict at this stage. It undoubtedly has the potential to reshape the views of the electorate, even if it hasn’t done so yet."

The school, along with [UA’s College of Medicine in Tucson](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2020/03/29/medical-students-ua-tucson-can-graduate-early-fight-covid-19/2936244001/), announced in late March that they would allow eligible [fourth-year medical students to graduate early](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2020/03/27/university-arizona-considers-early-graduation-medical-students-coronavirus-covid-19/2921785001/).

Many of the new doctors are staying in Phoenix to help, particularly by answering calls on a COVID-19 hotline, the university said in a press release.

The students had to apply for early graduation. The Phoenix medical school met last week to consider the applications. The UA's Tucson medical school is meeting this week to consider applications from its graduating class. 

Bridget Ralston’s residency at Banner University Medical Center in Phoenix doesn’t start until mid-June, the press release said.

In the meantime, the new doctor will be answering questions on a COVID-19 hotline, which is receiving more than 1,200 calls a day, to help the public and health care workers. She hopes to help relieve the burden on physicians who have more experience, allowing them to focus more on patients.

“There is a nationwide shortage of health care providers,” Ralston said in the press release. “This was true long before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Now, that shortage is even more keenly felt, as doctors are struggling to manage the addition of coronavirus patients into their already heavy workload. I applied to graduate early so that I can shoulder some of the responsibility.”"

Billy Nungesser (R) admitted he was “wrong” on Sunday for advocating that parades and conferences in New Orleans go on despite the growing coronavirus crisis.

Nungesser apologized to New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell for criticizing her decision to cancel events like the St. Patrick’s Day parades, on CNN. He said he “absolutely” regrets his comments. 

“So the mayor did the right thing,” he said. “In hindsight, I was wrong and she was right.”

ADVERTISEMENT
“I was looking at the tourism aspect of it and not knowing what was to come in the weeks to follow that,” he added.

Cantrell canceled New Orleans's events in early March, including the parades, prompting Nungesser to condemn her decision, saying in a USA Today interview that it would cause a ripple effect in the tourism industry.

""It sends a message to conventions and anyone coming to the city that it might not be safe,"" he had said.

The lieutenant governor said Sunday that the state government also would have taken a different approach to Mardi Gras, which took place Feb. 25, “if we had knowledge of what was to come.” He acknowledged that some of the people at Mardi Gras “surely” wouldn’t have contracted COVID-19 if it was canceled. 

“Mardi Gras is a big celebration. It brings a lot of people to Louisiana, and in hindsight had we known we probably would have taken different action,” he said. 

The state had received criticism for continuing to host Mardi Gras celebrations as the coronavirus was beginning to take hold in the U.S. in mid-February.  

Louisiana has confirmed 21,016 cases of coronavirus leading to 884 deaths, according to the Louisiana Department of Health. The Orleans Parish has identified 5,651 of those cases and 244 deaths."

#Restrictions by state

[This Article from the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/09/can-i-visit-my-parents-family-over-easter-nsw-victoria-queensland-australia-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-restrictions-explained) gives a really good summary

#Grocery Delivery

Services like HelloFresh (maybe not them specifically or in all areas) give a good subscription based food delivery service.

#Centrelink

We are trying to grow the r/centrelinkoz group as a community, please try and ask centrelink questions there, they are snowed under, appointments are shit, the welfare system has been catastrophically overwhelmed by this crisis, please be patient, they are doing the best they can while trying to grow staff numbers with *adequate training for those new staff*, which would you rather? Trained staff that cross the T's and dot the i's or would you rather your benefits get delayed because of mismanagement or you end up with a debt due to a mistake, a debt that you can't afford to pay back now?

#Jobs

If you are in an area that they are operating in, [BHP is still hiring hundreds of new staff to boost their operations](https://careers.bhp.com/) as are [Services Australia (Centrelink)](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/about-us/careers) and if you have a heavy vehicle licence, the issue is starting to become companies not having enough trucks for drivers they need, so they are moving to 2up and interchange drivers (Driver A arrives at a town, swaps with Driver B who is starting his shift, Driver B gets in the truck and Driver A gets a break in a Motel, and Driver A becomes the new Driver B for someone in the opposite direction), so although you might only have the licence, that might be a line if work for you if your core job has stood you down. Even local services need drivers.

#Food Delivery Specific jobs

Speaking of that, the rise in [Dark Kitchens](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/dark-kitchens-in-high-demand-as-isolation-boosts-delivery-services-20200409-p54imu.html) had led to an increased requirement for [UberEats Drivers](https://www.uber.com/au/en/drive/delivery/), [Deliveroo Drivers](https://deliveroo.com.au/apply), [GrubHub Drivers](https://driver.grubhub.com/), and [DoorDash Drivers](https://www.doordash.com/dasher/signup/)

#Unemployment Rates

So at this stage no new data has been released, but we [are sitting at 5.1% as of February, down from 5.3%](https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/unemployment-rate), this data is backed up [by data from the ABS showing a drop, however March is not up yet where I can find it](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6202.0).

If you have a subscription to The Australian, they [have an article claiming this number is closer to 16.8% at the moment](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/economics/real-unemployment-rate-168-roy-morgan-says/news-story/74f563aacb535541ab6313008966fb6d), but that is a Paywalled article, so I can't see it. If someone can, please copy-paste the text below so we can all see.

I'll add that u/Pwoper_Comment has found that the data The Australian seems to be using comes from [Roy Morgan](https://www.roymorgan.com/findings/8363-roy-morgan-unemployment-and-under-employment-march-2020-202004080900)

#When will restrictions be lifted?

So a lot of people are saying this can't last much longer, however when you [look at Graphs (The Guardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-cases-and-deaths), you will see that all the hardest hit countries so far have been in the Northern Hemisphere and were in the middle of their winter, [the Australian Flu Season typically peaks in August](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/flu-trends-in-australia) and at this point, COVID-19 is following a similar trend to both Influenza type viruses as well as Rhinoviruses in seasonal trends will make an impact, so as we have yet to see our winter, we still may see a spike.

[According to the ABC, there is still a chance of a second wave](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-second-wave/12138482), we (appear to) have flattened the curve on the *first wave* at this point in time, but we now need to maintain low cases, and prevent a second wave, so that may mean restrictions won't relax (QLD, NT, WA, SA type restrictions will stay) and the other states will drop back to restrictions matching QLD, but with a view to locking down again as soon as there is an uptick.

Failing a vaccine, this could easily get worse before it gets better.

#Oh, a Vaccine! Where's that currently?

[At this stage, we are looking maybe September](https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/healthmedicine/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-by-september-c-971014), but remember that link from before? Flu season peak is August. So we may hit another peak before it gets better.

Problem is, with so many laboratories working on Vaccines, [money is being cut to some very promising vaccine research](https://www.smh.com.au/national/we-were-so-close-three-potential-covid-19-vaccines-had-funding-cut-20200407-p54hw9.html), though you have to take this with a grain of salt, [just look at a Google News Feed of Coronavirus Vaccine, it's all over the place with lost and lots of stories almost hourly](https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus+vaccine&client=ms-android-asus&prmd=nvi&sxsrf=ALeKk03jzwU2I7naVmvIhT1JFJLrT8IH2g:1586642359888&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjcjvexr-HoAhVSzTgGHYb1A4wQ_AUoAXoECDYQAQ&biw=412&bih=764&dpr=2.63)

We've just broaded the sectors that can go to work, which basically means that construction workers can now go to work, the rest of public shops that are not essential MUST remain closed. (if you understand spanish this website might be better at explaining what the actual changes are than me: https://www.libertaddigital.com/espana/2020-04-11/coronavirus-que-cambia-en-el-estado-de-alarma-a-partir-del-lunes-1276655718/). And I cannot stress this enough, the rest of restrictions still apply, which means go to work, get back, and stay at home.

Yes, there's been people out there that have not taken the lockdown seriously, and they've been detained and fined because of it straight away. In fact the police has (usually) been really strict. But don't let those outliers lie to you, a lot of people are listening to the recommendations of the government, and the video of Madrid this morning proves it. That station is usually packed, yet under the lockdown it is mostly empty.

BTW for those curious about the actual infection numbers this site looks to be pretty accurate: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/

I do understand your concern, lifting restrictions too soon could make the infection rate go up again, but this is not soon, and has been thought throughly based on the recommendations of multiple experts. The lockdown is still expected to last at least until the 26th of April, and will likely be extended until the 11th (I said 15th earlier, but just double checked and it was 11th) of May based on what happens."

Many people have a rebellious attitude when individual officers behave badly or if they have had a previously bad or frightening experience, there are just some jobs where you have to be held to a higher standard (police/NHS etc) because of the damage that can happen if you aren't. Some people are also dicks and abusing the police isn't right either, but the police need to be careful here, it is important the police enforce the lockdown to do this they need public support (they can't arrest everyone), the more they do things like this the less they will have it.

I agree we need to follow the advice but there are several examples of police officers implementing laws that don't exist rather than enforcing the rules that are there (which they should do). And some forces are better than others (I have relatives in Cambridgeshire and their police force seems particularly bad given they were reprimanded for threatening to check shopping and now are apparently telling NHS staff their ID isn't proof their journey to work is essential)."

We like the area because everything is close (we even are getting a lot of trendy restaurants and have farmers markets and the like in Westerville) but then again we are on the more ""natural"" side of Polaris in an established neighborhood. Our neighborhood is awesome and summer block parties and hangouts are a norm (well, pre-Coronavirus.) I absolutely hated living downtown, but I also probably never found the right fit, and my house was constantly being broken into (Italian Village) and I had no space. I know it has changed a lot. But keep in mind, most people don't even work downtown anymore. I do love Grandview though and it's a dream neighborhood. 

I think people only think mall when they think of the area but I live one mile from Alum Creek and three miles from the other large body of water, Hoover. We have *six* separate bike and nature trails within a mile. Michelle didn't move here for this though, like a lot of us did.

With all this said, Mshelllll moved here for the mall and restaurants. She was technically in Plain City before, a solid 20 minute drive from most things Dublin, even though in Dublin schools. She is not moving to a beautifully natural area, everything will be manmade because it's truly in a cornfield (but is fairly close to Polaris, just not 5 minutes.) I just don't understand the move financially. I see the potential of a neighborhood like that but I would never move there because the point of me moving to the burbs was beauty and space! The houses there actually do have a bit of charm, I must say - as compared to other neighborhoods - but they overpaid for what they got and stone finishes and hideous custom tile does not make for long-term equity. If recession is even remotely bad that neighborhood will struggle and then all the benefits of that community will be lost and only remaining will be tiny lots.

The notes lay out detailed clinical criteria for dealing with suspected cases as well as warning of the risk of ease of transmission both by airborne droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces, suggesting isolation procedures.

As well as being posted online, the guidance was sent to the organisation’s regional emergency directors and country heads to be circulated to senior health officials.

One note, published on 11 January, advised clinicians and health officials to be alert to the emergence of clusters of cases as well as any “evidence of amplified or sustained human-to-human transmission” despite the Chinese, at that stage, not reporting sustained local transmission.

While the document advised medical personnel to look out for suspected patients who might have travelled to China’s Hubei province, or health workers who had contact with the then new virus, it also recommended that doctors look out for “unusual or unexpected clinical course, especially sudden deterioration despite appropriate treatment” regardless of those factors.

It added caution even if another clinical explanation had been advanced that appeared to “fully explain” the patient’s symptoms.

A day earlier, another guidance note on collecting samples from patients showing symptoms of the disease listed stringent precautions to avoid the risk of human-to-human transmission, using the experience from the Mers coronavirus.

The documents add to a body of emerging evidence of the widespread early warnings about the coronavirus, many communicated by – and to – senior US officials, which were ignored by Trump.

As much as I support your intentions, I think you should play safe first and then continue onwards.

I suggest you start with South Korea and Taiwan. They have a decent grip of the coronavirus, and most people (especially Korea) are coming out a little. South Korea has its urban as well as some traditional touches, especially in Seoul and Gyeongju. You can also go on a seaside trail hike in Jeju and get some black pork Korean barbecue as well.

Taiwan has a crazy amount of food variety and astounding night life, especially in Taipei's night markets. Fatten up a little, and then visit some natural spots throughout the country! Taroko National Park and Hualien have some quaint and scenic spots that you can go easy.

Personally I'd wait on Europe or India. Things are quite chaotic in Europe still, and I think India is at the beginning of a larger doom. It might take longer for the European countries to simmer down on their COVID-19 losses, especially Italy, Portugal, Spain, UK, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. I actually have a plan to go to Scandinavia this summer in late June as well, and I'm highly debating on postponing it to August or September (mostly because I'm not too sure about Sweden. I think Denmark and Norway will recover by May or June).

The fines are currently high enough, no sane person would risk being caught sitting on a bench for 250 euros. At a certain point you lose the effect of deterrence since some people will defy the law no matter how hard the financial punishment.

What however does work is usually creating a culture in which it's unacceptable to defy by society set rules. The punishment of social exclusion and shame usually works far better than financial punishment. This is why in history stuff like  [excommunication in religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication) or [the branding of criminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_branding#Branding_in_Britain) were so effective. Because each member of society would shun you from that point on, you no longer had someone to back you up since you were a heretic or marginalized. After all, we are definitely a social species, not necessarily a rational one.

Today, we still got politicians who sow resent by calling the current corona-measures idiotic and others who spread fake news from dubious accounts. This normalizes the behavior of people who defy the rules since they can justify their shitty behavior by appealing to authority.

EDIT: To try and get some perspective on how damaging isolation can be:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-isolation-social-recession-physical-mental-health](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-isolation-social-recession-physical-mental-health)

>“Loneliness increases earlier death by 26%, social isolation by 29% and living alone by 32%.”

Being isolated and excluded literally makes you die faster, no one wants that. This article is about self-isolation, but people in societies were they will get excluded for shitty behavior have 2 choices: Either you suffer from isolation and the psychological punishment coming with it or you adapt yourself to societal standards."
