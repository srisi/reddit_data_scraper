And the Aviation division was one of the most profitable up until recently. Also, the company currently employs around a quarter million people. If you take all these factors into account, you basically have an already struggling company faced with the choice of laying off 10000 people in the most profitable division or risking a huge portion of the business. Given how ingrained into the infrastructure of many countries GE is, I would not be surprised if they do get a bailout if needed.

I work in the distribution industry and I’ll try to explain to you why companies like mine and Amazon don’t close.

- Amazon and other large distributors are a supply chain for various critical businesses that must stay open.

- Allowing people to order product from Amazon prevents them from having to leave their homes for supplies.

- Amazon has distribution centres in all major population centres in Canada and the US which allows them to deliver those supplies to the general public quickly.

Listen I’m an ardent supporter of workers rights and health and safety, but closing companies like Amazon down risks more lives then you could imagine. If there workers don’t feel safe they have every right to express those issues or quit.

Give Bezos as much shit as you want but he gave all his employees a raise and they are actively taking steps to provide proper PPE to those who request it keeping in mind healthcare is much more critical. 

Finally, Amazon has been designated an essential business by the US government and CANT close.

News 8 introduced you to Dr. Jacob Glanville of Distributed Bio a couple of weeks ago. He's one of the doctors featured in the Netflix show ""Pandemic."" His team in the Bay Area has been working around the clock trying to come up with a drug to treat COVID-19. Monday he announced he believes they've found one.

""We are happy to announce we have completed the engineering and we have some very potent antibodies that can be effective against the virus,"" said Dr. Glanville.

Below is News 8 reporter Kelly Hessedal's extended interview with Dr. Glanville and the answers he gave on the potential cure:


How did you come up with this potential cure?

We took a series of five antibodies from around 2002 that were able to neutralize SARS. We were able to use technology in our laboratories to evolve those antibodies against SARS to adapt them to recognize COVID-19.

We tried with five different antibodies because we weren’t sure which one would work the best. All five worked so we have a pretty powerful tool chest available to us right now to produce a final therapeutic.

Would the drug be a shot? Or a pill? 

We think we will be able to deliver it as a shot. We’ve been deliberately trying to engineer extremely potent antibodies because if they’re potent you need less material and then you could give it as an injection.

Will you be doing the trials on sick patients in the United States? 

This is a conversation we’re having with the United States government on exactly where the study is being done. We're also talking to the European Commission.

We want to make sure when we’re ready to release this we’re ready to release it to the entire world.

What is the next step?

We are sending [the antibodies] to the military for confirmation testing and to Charles River Laboratories for safety and tox characterization. We’ve partnered with two different companies that will help us scale up large batches of the antibody for production. We're in discussions to start humane phase one/two trials that would happen at the end of the summer.

Pending good results - [if] we see the drug is safe and helpful means we could start releasing it for compassionate use in September.

How excited were you when you guys realized all this hard work you put in may have really paid off?

I have a remarkable team. It blows me away the endless amount of time they were able to invest in this."

--------------------

The actual number is likely higher.  The reason why the confirmed number cases is increasing at around the same rate now is because we are doing around the same number of tests each day. However, we should expect an acceleration in the coming days when measuring confirmed deaths."

I know that medical education and training is not always the most exciting thing for non-medical people, but one way citizens can help is to push for more residency positions for us. 

Residency spots are paid for mostly by Medicare and have been more or less frozen for YEARS, despite the growing need for more physicians to be trained. Additionally, there are about 3000 US graduated doctors who do not match to a residency and therefore can't practice each year (due to external competition from foreign graduates). 

We need more residency positions in order to meet the demand, but it isn't a sexy topic to push. If citizens could ask their representatives to finally approve more funding for additional residency positions, it would go a long way towards helping this problem."

Smith, essentially says that as long as **the government isn’t asking the church to do something it isn’t asking everyone else to do**, it’s on solid legal ground.

2020-03-30,weresabre,Coronavirus,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fs2blm/comparing_coronavirus_responses_what_did_canada/flz2q7b/,"One stark difference is that Canadian politicians, across federal and all provincial jurisdictions and political ideologies, have listened to their public health officials and crafted policies based on expert medical advice.

The Canadian healthcare system is single-payer and universal.  All hospitals are operated by provincial Ministries of Health.  Canadians are not deterred from seeking medical attention because of cost.

Another factor is the current absence of divisive partisanship in Canada, which has enabled unified and coordinated government responses to the pandemic.  Here in British Columbia, the opposition BC Liberals (don't let the name fool you, they're a right-wing coalition of Liberals and Conservatives) and the Green Party have refrained from gratuitously attacking the minority social democratic NDP government during this crisis.

The Canadian response is not perfect.  We should have had testing done earlier, and wider.  We do not have sufficient supplies of PPE for workers in non-essential sectors (like grocery and pharmacy retail).  If we had followed the South Korean model, we might not have had to shut our economy down.  However, there is a glimmer of hope that we're not following Italy or Spain in this pandemic."

The majority of these lock downs are bs and are not enforced and you still see way to many people going about their lives like nothing is happening. 

You can still fly all over the US, and travel from state to state however you please...so even if a city does a good job with their lockdown they will still end up with a shit ton of imported cases from nearby states. 

Even my state of Ohio, our governor Mike Dewine has done an excellent job of being proactive and was one of the earlier states to close schools, go on a lockdown/safe at home bs..but even for all his good work he still let's mega churches congregate with thousands of church goers every Sunday.

A virus is the stuff of mystery and fear, an invisibly lurking danger ready to spread explosively around the globe. The new coronavirus, like SARS, MERS and the seasonal flu, enters our bodies, finds its way inside our DNA and commandeers it to make more copies of itself. Viruses are, in many ways, the ultimate parasites.

Yet we, like every other creature on Earth, have a complex relationship with them. Many of the traits that make viruses so effective at transmitting disease also make them an essential part of our genetic makeup. As it turns out, their contributions to our genome over the eons account for a range of important human qualities.

Viruses sit at the edge of our definition of living things. They are tiny bits of genetic material enclosed by a protective shell. Alone, they sit lifeless and inert, waiting for a favorable environment in which to reproduce. Viruses are carried to their unwilling hosts by insects, droplets in the air, contact with infected surfaces and other mechanisms that bring cells of different species together.

When a virus encounters a host cell, a chain reaction of molecular events is set in motion: The virus attaches itself to the outer wall of the cell, enters inside, travels to the cell’s genome, merges with its genes and then tricks the host’s genome into making copies of itself.

The host cell becomes a factory for new viruses and can produce as many as a million of them before it dies. This explosive growth can happen simultaneously in tissues throughout the body. As the virus spreads in one individual’s body, it can escape via water droplets expelled from the air in the lungs, sweat produced by sweat glands or fluids produced by other organs, thereby passing the infection to others.

There are more viruses on Earth than there are stars in the known universe.
This selfish behavior makes viruses, as a Darwinian matter, enormously successful. There is an almost unfathomable number of them in and around us all the time. By some estimates, the number of viruses in the oceans alone is as large as a 10 with 31 zeros behind it. All told, there are more viruses on Earth than there are stars in the known universe.

What’s more, viruses are incredibly diverse and ever evolving. That is why we need a new flu vaccine each year and suffer from emerging diseases like Covid-19 with increasing regularity.

But researchers at the University of Utah came away with a different take on viruses while working in 2016 on a gene that plays a role in the ability to make memories. Mice with a mutation in this gene, known as Arc, can find their way through a maze with cheese in the center but—unlike mice with the normal Arc gene—can’t remember their path through the maze the next day. In humans, changes to Arc have been linked to a range of disorders, from schizophrenia to dementia. Arc is a gene that memories are made of.

To understand the gene, the team in Utah isolated the protein it made and put it under a powerful microscope. The lead researcher, Jason Shepherd, saw that the protein formed spheres that were visible at high magnification. That structure set off alarm bells for him: He was sure he had seen such spheres when he took a course in infectious diseases in his early days in graduate school. The Arc protein had spherules that looked exactly like those made by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Dr. Shepherd gave the slide to viral specialists working in the building next door without telling them what was on it. The virus experts were sure they were looking at spheres made by HIV.

When the team sequenced the gene for Arc, decoding the string of molecules that make it up, they were in for an even bigger surprise. This memory gene was, for all purposes, a modified virus.


A memory gene was, for all purposes, a modified virus.
The virus that causes AIDS makes protein spheres because they protect HIV’s genes as they journey from cell to cell in its host. As it turns out, the same thing happens with the memory gene, Arc, which also works by moving genetic information from cell to cell. The viral strategy of making protein spheres, which is so dangerous in disease, works to our benefit in Arc.

Memory genes aren’t the only ones derived from viruses in our bodies. Genes that make proteins at work in the placenta, so essential for human reproduction, also arose from viruses. When a team from Germany did a computational search of the human genome, they found that as many as 85 genes derived from viruses may be at work in different parts of the brain and during pregnancy.

The past two decades have witnessed a golden age of genome projects. We have mapped the human genome, the corn genome and genomes for many thousands of species of microbes, fungi, animals and plants. With all this information, the more we look, the more we find ancient viruses hiding inside our genomes, as well as those of other creatures.

Almost 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected us but have been rendered inactive. That fact is even more astounding when you consider that genes—the part of DNA that codes for proteins—comprise only 2% of our genome. We have four times more viral genetic material inside our genome than our own genes.

The ability to make spheres to move genetic material from cell to cell, so essential in the spread of infections such as AIDS, became useful to our distant ancestors. Researchers looking at the history of Arc have found that fish don’t have it, but their descendants—amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals—do. The ancient fish that evolved to walk on land about 375 million years ago, it seems, got an infection that would change the course of history and, ultimately, our own abilities.


We live in a state of war between viral invaders and our own genome. One outcome can be that viruses take over and we become ill. The other is that viruses can be the source of new genetic inventions—fuel for evolutionary change.

Viruses are microscopic pieces of genetic material capable of wreaking havoc on our world and disrupting our interactions with one another. Yet new insights into genomes, and four billion years of the history of life, offer another side of the story. Each one of us is part virus, in ways that affect who we are and what we can do.

Michael was absolutely worse than Katrina.  Maybe not on a lives-lost metric since it's a less populated area, but the infrastructure, the homes, the businesses.  Gone.

I saw that the number ended in 25, a perfect square, and from there I just had to figure out how many 25's there are (four in 100- twelve 100 in 1200 -bringing me to 48- and then one more for 1225- bringing me to 49)

So, I was able to use that property with 25 and 49. If it were another number, like 729, with another perfect square (in that example, I'd start with 9).

Now, if it were something like 303, that'd be a little trickier.  I could give a good approximation using that method. 303 is super close to 300. 300=100*3. Take the square roots of those, 10 *root3. Well, root 3 is about 1.75, so it is 3/4 larger than 10 (which is 17.5), so I'd guess the squart root of 303 is around 17.5 (and it is about 17.406).
