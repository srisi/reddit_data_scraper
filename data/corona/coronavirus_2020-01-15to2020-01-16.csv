Antibiotics are not used to treat viruses - in this instance if we are to believe what they've said: the new virus (from sequencing and typical virus isolation assays) is a coronavirus. Past examples are SARS and MEV-1.

The antibodics in livestock is not a problem isolated to China. But yes that is a potential contributor to global antibiotics resistance.

And yes I would be wary RE china's reporting of emerging outbreaks. Their virus identification results/technical aspect (as far as I'm aware) has not been released to outside observers yet.

They really should as China has at least one WHO reference labs."

Has a much lower fatality rate than SARS (10%) and MERS (35%). Doesn’t seem to be that transmittable from human to human at the moment or else there’d be a ton more cases. Here’s advice from the CDC about what you can do to protect yourself. Not much different than protecting yourself against the cold.

They don't fight off coronavirus or influenza like we do, and a strain of herpesvirus causes lifelong URI. Both my cats have had permanent URI from being shelter kitties. 

It's unfortunate, and shelter staff are seriously vigilant about infection control but they're overworked, under-resourced, and fighting an unwinnable fight. Foster cat homes are sometimes faced with the same problems, but after infection all we can do is mitigation and symptom management. Most well taken care of cats have unobtrusive symptoms, like stuffiness and rasping. 

My poor sweetie gets what appears to be sinus headaches, vet has confirmed. All I can do is give her a humidifier, ensure she doesn't get drafty, and lots of warm blankets for comfort. Lots of the time I'll cradle her head, she pushes into my hand to put pressure on her forehead and fall asleep. Or put my forehead on her forehead, it's a real treat.

Your cat's story is very harrowing. I hope it is caused by an early-life virus instead (kittens are more vulnerable to larger more noticeable permanent changes that can persist, like respiratory tract/sinus problems)."

The man had been to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where there has been an outbreak of pneumonia believed to be caused by the new coronavirus strain, it said.

> On Monday, authorities in Thailand confirmed the first case outside China of a patient infected with the new virus. The 61-year-old woman, identified as a Chinese tourist from the city in central Hubei province, received treatment in a hospital in Nonthaburi near Bangkok but was recovering.

As far as i know Malaysia had also one case!

We, as Travellers, should be a bit “extra-careful”, spec. inside of international Planes!"

>The SARS coronavirus was purportedly discovered by World Health Organization (WHO) researchers working in ten labs linked by a private closed-circuit communication system. **No outside researchers were given access**.

>The WHO researchers very quickly found the unique and never-before-seen coronavirus, and they labeled it the cause of SARS. At that point, virtually every virologist in the world stood up, saluted, and *never questioned the finding*, because to do so could earn them an ejection from The Club.

From that point on, **no statistics were released that demonstrated how many diagnosed SARS patients had the coronavirus virus in their bodies and how many didn’t**.

But months later, a prominent World Health Organization microbiologist in Canada, Frank Plummer, wandered off the reservation and spoke with reporters. What he said, in a series of statements, was shocking.

**Plummer basically admitted that many of the newest blood samples from SARS patients coming into his lab showed no trace of the SARS coronavirus**.
