2020-04-03,phi808,wallstreetbets,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fuht7f/corporate_bond_downgrades_grow_hyg_74p_515/fmctxhc/,"From the article:

U.S. corporate bonds are being downgraded at breakneck speeds, highlighting the threat posed to companies’ balance sheets by the coronavirus crisis.

The pace of downgrades over the last two weeks was the fastest on record in one major corporate-bond index going back to 2002, according to BofA Global Research.

The index, known as the ICE BofAML U.S. Corporate Index, has suffered $569 billion in downgrades since March 16, said Bank of America.

Credit-ratings firms downgraded a net $560 billion of investment-grade corporate bonds in the index last month, the bank added. While total downgrades remained lower than at the same point during the financial crisis, the pace accelerated in recent weeks as ratings firms and investors reassessed the ability of borrowers to repay their debts.

Fears that the crisis will spur bankruptcies and a prolonged recession have helped drive the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. corporate investment grade index down 3.9% in the first quarter of 2020, the worst performance since the end 2016. Analysts said there is still room for more companies to fall down the ratings ladder, with businesses closed and consumers stuck at home, despite the Federal Reserve’s recent extraordinary efforts to support the corporate debt market.

“The Fed programs cannot stem the negative actions that credit rating agencies have already taken and will continue to take,” said UBS senior credit strategist Barry McAlinden. “Downgrades are a normal part of an economic down cycle, and the anticipation for negative rating actions is a reason why [investment-grade bond] spreads are where they currently stand.”

Investors are being compensated more to hold corporate bonds. Adjusted for options, the spread, or extra yield investors demanded to hold investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays index over Treasury bonds increased by 1.79 percentage points during the first quarter—a record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Investors watch downgrades because it is one sign of deteriorating conditions in the corporate sector. Many funds also can’t hold debt below investment-grade, so downgrades could put added pressure on the debt market in an already difficult trading environment.

“A wave of downgrades would unquestionably cause disruption given the swell of new names into the high-yield market,” said Mike Terwilliger, portfolio manager at Resource America. “The market would absorb the paper, but it would definitely bring a temporary downdraft.”

Downgrades haven’t stopped a deluge of new bonds being sold by investment-grade companies. A record amount was issued last week, and in recent days, some speculative-grade companies have joined in. After Yum Brands Inc. completed the first high-yield bond sale in nearly a month on Monday, more have followed. Sales by aerospace manufacturer TransDigm Group Inc., fast-food operator Restaurant Brands International Inc. and Tenet Healthcare Corp. were expected to close on Thursday.

U.S. Treasury yields were down on Thursday. The benchmark 10-year yield fell to 0.624%, according to Tradeweb, from 0.630% at Wednesday’s close. The intraday yield of the 30-year bond fell to 1.268%, from 1.285%.

As downgrades from ratings firms like S&P and Moody’s accelerate, more companies at the lower rungs of the investment-grade bond market are at risk of having their ratings pushed into junk territory, becoming what is known on Wall Street as fallen angels. More than $97 billion in debt tied to 13 companies including Ford Motor Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp., and Western Midstream Partners LP lost investment-grade status in March.

Wall Street analysts say more fallen angels are likely, with many triple-B bond investors demanding larger spreads compared with their speculative-grade counterparts. Around $343 billion of triple-B rated bonds issued in developed markets trade at a higher premium over U.S. Treasurys than double-B rated bonds, says Bank of America.

Cruise operator Carnival Corp., which is under review for downgrades, sold $4 billion of new triple-B bonds Wednesday at an initial yield of 11.9%. T-Mobile Inc. was set to sell triple-B bonds to pay down a bridge loan used to fund its purchase of Sprint Corp."

For the pandemic and society in general I haven’t yet seen anything better than this (written a week ago) https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/608719/

For the future of BJJ here’s a bit of what I wrote in https://www.grapplearts.com/covid-19-bjj/

**The Future of BJJ During and After COVID**

First of all, in the short term it’s clear that all martial arts schools will face at least temporary devastation.

If they’re not closed already (damn them if they’re not) then they will be in very short order.I just hope that the students that can afford it continue to pay their dues so that there might be a school to come back to.

So the question becomes not IF they’re going to close, but for HOW LONG the schools are going to close.

The sad news here is that it’s still too soon to tell when they’ll be able to reopen.

But if I had to guess, the best case is at end of summer.  And the worst case is sometime next year.

A vaccine is most likely going to take a long time.  There’s a reason that every expert keeps on warning us that a vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop.  (Can we start believing the experts now please?)

And even if there’s a miracle cure or the world’s fastest vaccine development, by the time it rolls out to the general population it’ll be months and months and months.

So that’s nothing to count on.  Let’s talk about other scenarios….

Let’s say that testing for coronavirus becomes cheap and easy.  Like a $5 test you can do in 5 minutes that’s 99.9% accurate.

If those roll out I could see clubs having testing requirements.  Not belt testing requirements, but rather viral load testing requirements. You can’t step foot onto the mat unless you’ve been found negative for the virus.

Now let’s look at the exact opposite scenario: one where you can only train if you’ve HAD the virus.

Let’s assume that we find out that you can’t get reinfected by the virus (that’s a big ‘if’ by the way – the evidence isn’t at all clear yet either way).

If that’s true then maybe people who’ve survived infection will start training together.  Maybe just in small groups initially, but then in larger groups and eventually you’ll have entire schools that are just for COVID-19 survivors.

In the fire department we’re talking about the idea of possibly having clean and dirty firehalls.

Clean halls for firefighters who have NOT had corona yet.

And dirty halls for people who’ve had it and gotten better, or people who have it, are sick, but could still fight a fire.

So in the same way I could see that MAYBE  we end up with clean and dirty dojos.

Clubs and facilities where people are tested and found to be clear.  And other dojos where people have had COVID and are now OK.

It’s CRITICAL to note that this could only happen if people can’t get reinfected once they’ve gotten over this illness.  Otherwise we’ll keep on passing it along to the next guy, and the next guy, and then back to ourselves.

It’s very, very dystopian vision of testing and societal segragation. But it could happen.

Let’s all hope for a better solution.  A cure, or a vaccine.

But for that to work we need to slow down the spread of the virus."

I'm sure you've had good days and bad days and plenty of ups and downs in between - we all have and you're not alone in feeling like you're operating at less than your best right now.

Keep in mind, as always, that this is *temporary.*

You will feel better. Cities and countries will slow down and recover. The world will open up again. For now, we're going to continue with our social distancing so we can keep the good trends going (lowering the burden on healthcare, protecting those who are most at-risk, and keeping an eye on our own mental well-being in the meantime).

Let's bring up a few things while we're here that might help you out. You didn't realize you were getting a novel here, did you?

First, even the countries hit the hardest by the virus (especially Italy and Spain) are beginning to show statistical data that they're rapidly reaching or are already in their peak period as growth of both new cases and daily deaths has **plateaued** (Source: [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)). What this means is that there is good evidence that social distancing and quarantine measures are helping these areas get to the point where we should soon start seeing those figures decrease day by day. With fewer new cases comes fewer hospitalizations and less stress on the healthcare system. With less stress on the healthcare system, more people who need specialized care have access to that care and healthcare workers can get a little bit of well-deserved relief. This will happen to every location, so if you're in an especially hard-hit region right now or you've seen some scary prediction headline about peaks for your area in the next 1-2 weeks, know that it will pass and the more people follow social distancing and self-care guidelines (stay home when you don't feel well and wash your hands!) the lower those peaks could be. We're not out of it yet, but there is an end in sight. Every day gets us closer!

Second, with more time and more data comes more accurate estimations! This week, the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM) updated their best-guess estimate of the Infection Fatality Rate (or IFR, the % of people who die out of *everyone* who gets infected with a virus) to be **0.1-0.26%**. That means out of everyone who gets the virus - **including those with pre-existing conditions and the elderly** \- it is expected that anywhere from 0.1% to 0.26% will die. They point out that it is just impossible to 100% accurately predict these kinds of figures *in the middle of a pandemic* and that only after everything has calmed down will we begin to see the real numbers, which will certainly be lower than current estimates. (Source: [CEBM](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/))

>We could make a simple estimation of the IFR as 0.26%, based on halving the lowest boundary of the CFR prediction interval. However, the considerable uncertainty over how many people have the disease means an IFR of 0.26 is likely an overestimate. In Swine flu, the IFR ended up as 0.02%, fivefold less than the lowest estimate during the outbreak (the lowest estimate was 0.1% in the 1st ten weeks of the outbreak). In Iceland, where the most testing per capita has occurred, the  IFR lies between. 0.01% and 0.19%.  
>  
>Taking account of historical experience, trends in the data, increased number of infections in the population at largest, and potential impact of misclassification of deaths gives a presumed estimate for the COVID-19 IFR between 0.1% and 0.26%.\*

Third, the amount of testing each country is doing is absolutely skyrocketing, which is fantastic for understanding this virus. The side effect to this is that we will be seeing way more confirmed new cases coming in over the coming weeks, but please try not to equate more confirmed cases with a sudden explosion of the virus. Viruses don't work that way and when you see that one area's case count rose rapidly from one day to the next, it is almost certainly because more and more tests are being performed and a higher number of results are coming in. **More cases does not mean the virus is exploding, it means we're finally seeing the cases that were already there.** Take solace in the fact that more testing means we have more data and knowledge to put to work on cures, vaccines, and general understanding of the true severity and spread. (Source: [ourworldindata.org/covid-testing](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing)).

Fourth, not only are supply lines doing well, even the effects of the waves of panic buying are disappearing. Stores are stocked in all countries and no one is going hungry due to the virus, not even in the hardest hit areas. A bit anecdotally, Tesco in the UK had this to say about grocery store supply lines just 3 days ago (Source: [Tesco](https://www.tescoplc.com/news/2020/our-latest-response-to-covid-19-a-message-to-customers-from-dave-lewis-tesco-ceo/)):

>In fresh food, our stock levels have returned to almost normal levels, with plenty of fruit and vegetables available. In packaged groceries, the recovery will take a few more days – most stores will have stock of just about everything, but in a few product areas we may still have some gaps.

This really is a waiting game at this point, which can be so frustrating, mind-numbing, anxiety-filled, or worrying. Some people get scared because they worry there is no end in sight, that the disruption to their lives will go on indefinitely. That is not the case. We are disrupting life now to protect those who need protecting and things will get better. You will still have those bad hours or days, but you're allowed to have times of vulnerability.

Just try to keep yourself occupied when you can and don't slack off on allowing yourself some time to feel as good as you can. Sit in the sun. Watch a TV series or a couple of movies. Read a book. Do some pushups and stretch your body. Cook something you really love to eat (I'm impatiently waiting for some homemade lasagna to finish!). **You will get through this and you will be stronger for it**, even if you don't feel that to be true right now. Your brain is not a medical expert or an economics guru. When it tells you to be scared or to lose hope, it's not coming from a place of knowledge because all of the knowledge and data points to you making it out the other side of this a better, more resilient human being. Be kind to each other! ❤️

If November comes around and Trump somehow comes out of this pandemic looking competent, like he responded well, and that he kept things from being as bad as they could be, people will turn out in droves to vote for him and he'll win in a landslide.

If November comes around and we've continued to have record unemployment, a bunch of people have lost their health insurance, and tons of people have had loved ones die, they're not going to vote for the incumbent president, no matter what they promise (not all the people that voted for him the first time, obviously, but it doesn't take a lot for it to be enough).

This election is basically going to be a referendum on how people think Trump handled the coronavirus crisis. Nobody gives a fuck about Hunter Biden or anything else really (I mean, this sub does, but this sub isn't like most voters and we all know that). And the rally the flag bump isn't going to last seven more months, Trump's eventually going to have to do something good if he wants to not lose."

The spread of the novel coronavirus in Spain has shown signs of slowing over the past week. The number of new infections is on a decline, while its daily death toll has also fell, Spain's health ministry confirmed.

The ministry reported 7,472 new infections on Friday morning, which was a 6.8 percent increase in cases, the smallest jump reported since the outbreak began. The figure followed Thursday's record low increase of 7.9 percent, according to Spain's Ministry of Health.

> Trump at a FEB 28 rally: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa, they can’t even count. No they can’t. They can’t count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We’re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.

He is **clearly** saying that Russia was a hoax, the impeachment was a hoax, and that the corona virus is the liberals new hoax. That can't possibly be up for discussion - it's very, very clearly his meaning.

Edit: /u/FlREBALL - Why would the part of the quote you use for context be the part where he accuses the democrats of politicizing it? A) There's no basis for that - they were speaking the truth and B) We're talking about what he is describing as the hoax. Here is the part that we're focusing on:

> They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. **And this is their new hoax.**

How could he possibly be saying the democrats are the hoax here? He says, ""**this** is **their** new hoax"". This sentence is synonymous with what Trump said:

""The corona virus(this) is the democrats(their) new hoax.""

This isn't debatable. This isn't my opinion. I just described facts akin to gravity and evolution. He said - without question - that the corona virus is a hoax."

>The Trump administration is expected to use a federal stimulus package to pay hospitals that treat uninsured people with the new coronavirus as long as they agree not to bill the patients or issue unexpected charges, according to two people familiar with the planning.

>Hospitals treating the uninsured often bill patients for the difference between the amount they get from the government and the cost of care. The uninsured also may get bills for care provided by doctors who aren’t directly employed by the hospital. Both would be barred under the administration proposal, and hospitals would likely be reimbursed at current Medicare rates, people familiar with the planning said.

2020-04-03,AStartlingStatement,Coronavirus,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fujfo8/the_coronavirus_pandemic_will_forever_alter_the/fmd33vs/,">The surreal atmosphere of the Covid-19 pandemic calls to mind how I felt as a young man in the 84th Infantry Division during the Battle of the Bulge. Now, as in late 1944, there is a sense of inchoate danger, aimed not at any particular person, but striking randomly and with devastation. But there is an important difference between that faraway time and ours. American endurance then was fortified by an ultimate national purpose. Now, in a divided country, efficient and farsighted government is necessary to overcome obstacles unprecedented in magnitude and global scope. Sustaining the public trust is crucial to social solidarity, to the relation of societies with each other, and to international peace and stability.

>Nations cohere and flourish on the belief that their institutions can foresee calamity, arrest its impact and restore stability. When the Covid-19 pandemic is over, many countries’ institutions will be perceived as having failed. Whether this judgment is objectively fair is irrelevant. The reality is the world will never be the same after the coronavirus. To argue now about the past only makes it harder to do what has to be done.

>The coronavirus has struck with unprecedented scale and ferocity. Its spread is exponential: U.S. cases are doubling every fifth day. At this writing, there is no cure. Medical supplies are insufficient to cope with the widening waves of cases. Intensive-care units are on the verge, and beyond, of being overwhelmed. Testing is inadequate to the task of identifying the extent of infection, much less reversing its spread. A successful vaccine could be 12 to 18 months away.

>The U.S. administration has done a solid job in avoiding immediate catastrophe. The ultimate test will be whether the virus’s spread can be arrested and then reversed in a manner and at a scale that maintains public confidence in Americans’ ability to govern themselves. The crisis effort, however vast and necessary, must not crowd out the urgent task of launching a parallel enterprise for the transition to the post-coronavirus order.

>Leaders are dealing with the crisis on a largely national basis, but the virus’s society-dissolving effects do not recognize borders. While the assault on human health will—hopefully—be temporary, the political and economic upheaval it has unleashed could last for generations. No country, not even the U.S., can in a purely national effort overcome the virus. Addressing the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program. If we cannot do both in tandem, we will face the worst of each.

>Drawing lessons from the development of the Marshall Plan and the Manhattan Project, the U.S. is obliged to undertake a major effort in three domains. First, shore up global resilience to infectious disease. Triumphs of medical science like the polio vaccine and the eradication of smallpox, or the emerging statistical-technical marvel of medical diagnosis through artificial intelligence, have lulled us into a dangerous complacency. We need to develop new techniques and technologies for infection control and commensurate vaccines across large populations. Cities, states and regions must consistently prepare to protect their people from pandemics through stockpiling, cooperative planning and exploration at the frontiers of science.

>Second, strive to heal the wounds to the world economy. Global leaders have learned important lessons from the 2008 financial crisis. The current economic crisis is more complex: The contraction unleashed by the coronavirus is, in its speed and global scale, unlike anything ever known in history. And necessary public-health measures such as social distancing and closing schools and businesses are contributing to the economic pain. Programs should also seek to ameliorate the effects of impending chaos on the world’s most vulnerable populations.

>Third, safeguard the principles of the liberal world order. The founding legend of modern government is a walled city protected by powerful rulers, sometimes despotic, other times benevolent, yet always strong enough to protect the people from an external enemy. Enlightenment thinkers reframed this concept, arguing that the purpose of the legitimate state is to provide for the fundamental needs of the people: security, order, economic well-being, and justice. Individuals cannot secure these things on their own. The pandemic has prompted an anachronism, a revival of the walled city in an age when prosperity depends on global trade and movement of people.

>The world’s democracies need to defend and sustain their Enlightenment values. A global retreat from balancing power with legitimacy will cause the social contract to disintegrate both domestically and internationally. Yet this millennial issue of legitimacy and power cannot be settled simultaneously with the effort to overcome the Covid-19 plague. Restraint is necessary on all sides—in both domestic politics and international diplomacy. Priorities must be established.

>We went on from the Battle of the Bulge into a world of growing prosperity and enhanced human dignity. Now, we live an epochal period. The historic challenge for leaders is to manage the crisis while building the future. Failure could set the world on fire."

> The White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in a turf battle between some of the president’s advisers and experts at the country’s leading public health agency over whether Americans should wear face coverings in public, according to administration officials.
> 
> White House coronavirus task force officials have been considering whether to recommend universal use of face coverings or cloth face masks when people go out in public or making the guidance narrowly targeted to areas with high community transmission of the virus that causes covid-19.
> 
> Some senior administration officials have pushed to focus on people living in the hardest-hit areas because they are worried that wide community use of masks is unnecessary and could cause panic.
> 
> But federal health officials, including experts at the CDC, say the guidance only makes sense if it is recommended broadly because it would be an additional way to contain the virus and prevent communities with low transmission from becoming areas with explosive spread. The original CDC guidance was for widespread community use.
> 
> The White House’s targeted version appeared to be the one that was winning early Friday.
> 
> The debate has been ongoing in recent days, with White House officials privately contradicting CDC proposals for everyone to wear face coverings. The topic was part of spirited debate in the coronavirus task force meetings this week, and in Oval Office discussions with the president, according to senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the proposed guidance.
> 
> 
> One of the main proponents for wider mask use has been Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner in the Trump administration who has been acting as an informal adviser to the White House and sometimes talks to Trump and regularly speaks with administration officials.
> 
> The latest draft guidance that CDC has been directed to issue is recommending the use of cloth face coverings, if feasible, in locations of the United States where there is significant community-based transmission, according to a federal health official involved in the response.
> 
> The guidance makes clear that wearing face coverings or cloth masks is an additional public health measure to prevent the spread of the virus, not a substitute for social distancing. Social distancing of at least six feet is still recommended even when wearing a mask. Guidance and internal memos from CDC emphasize that a cloth facial mask is intended not so much to protect the wearer but to help prevent people who do not know they are infected from spreading of the virus to others.
> 
> Recommendations for people to wear face coverings in public would represent a major change in CDC guidance that healthy people don’t need masks or face coverings. Internal memos and guidance make clear the coverings under discussion are not medical masks, such as N95 respirators or surgical face masks, which are needed by front-line health-care workers and are in extremely short supply. Those must continue to be reserved, they say.
> 
> Separately, U.S. officials are weighing a plan to distribute reusable cloth face masks — not medical masks — to U.S. households, starting with locations hardest hit by covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a federal official involved in the response and documents shared with The Post.
> 
> CDC memos and guidance on face coverings were drafted in recent days and prompted by increasing evidence that infected people without symptoms can spread the coronavirus. Simple cloth masks that cover the mouth and nose can prevent virus transmission from such individuals when they are out buying groceries, when people may come into closer contact, for example.
> 
> On Friday, Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also said on “Fox & Friends” that there was additional information for wearing face coverings. He pointed to “recent information that the virus can actually be spread even when people just speak as opposed to coughing and sneezing, the better part of valor is that when you’re out and you can’t maintain that six-foot distance to wear some sort of facial covering … So this is an addendum and an addition to the physical separation, not as a substitute for it.”
> 
> Many state, county and city officials have suggested that people should wear face coverings, such as cloth masks or bandannas, when going out in public. The latest came from Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D), who recommended Friday that all people in the state wear a mask any time they leave their homes.
> 
> “Masks help prevent people from sharing illnesses,” he said. “But, they don’t do a great job at keeping people from getting sick; and, they’re not foolproof, so it is critical that our first act is to ask ourselves if we really need to leave our house. If we don’t really, truly need to leave, then we shouldn’t.”"

Also an actual word. This helps prevent people who resent the virus from blaming the Chinese. Consider how Egypt killed off all their pigs during the Swine Flu epidemic.

It's ambiguous, since it could refer to a wide variety of common colds, or even to a brand of beer, but [see the relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2275/). Everyone will know what you're talking about.

 For context I've been pushed toward this opinion because I've been harassed for worrying about having a job in the next couple of months. My whole family, my father, aunts, brother, husband, roommate, and most of my friends are in aerospace. If we get laid off there is no ""borrow money from a family member."" No jobs to go back to because I was laid off from my last job, my dad was laid off from his job before his current one (10+ years ago) and moved to get his current job so no going back. My husband won't sign up for another round in the military. My brother just graduated and was already laid off, my aunt moved for her current job and bought a house. We are highly skilled for the aerospace industry and now there are layoffs upon layoffs. It isn't expected to recover for YEARS. 
And whenever I say something like ""I'm worried about the coronavirus but I'm really afraid my entire family won't have jobs next month,"" people say things like ""I bet you'd care if your family gets sick."" 

A lot of people in my family have pre- existing conditions. If my dad gets laid off he loses his insurance, and my brother can die because he has an asthma attack, my mom can't take her psychiatric medicine and kills herself, my dad can't take his blood pressure medication so has a heart attack, then he can't help take care of my grandparents and they die. 

If I get laid off I can't pay all of my bills, if my husband is laid off we can't afford any of our bills, if my roommate is laid off we lose our house.

So your family might get sick, and some might even die from the coronavirus, and my family will be financially ruined and some of my family members will have no health insurance and will possibly die. It's not a ""we just have to get through this now"" scenario for me. It's a ""we have to survive this now AND later.""

 My dad is too old to get hired for another job, and he is highly skilled for aerospace. He won't get hired for other industries because of his specialization and his age. Hell, he probably can't get hired in aerospace due to his age. He was supposed to retire in five years and his company just laid off like 50% of their people. My husband has no skills outside of aerospace. We will be going from $1000 a week paychecks to $300, probably even less if all we can find is part time retail work. I have thousands in college debt and I'll be going back to part time work. Layoffs were announced at our work, projected long term layoffs, and we don't know if or how we will be affected. It sucks hoping your coworker loses their job instead of you.

I wouldn't feel this way if people would show even a little empathy for my situation, but now I don't care. I have to worry about me because no one else is."

Working together, we can quickly help millions of working people and families who are struggling to survive during this crisis.

Here is a clipping from the Guardian for example:

Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).
If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on."

2020-04-03,Thrax23,Coronavirus,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fu8saj/daily_discussion_post_april_03_questions_images/fmcrrem/,"Here's the analogy to end all analogies regarding why comparing coronavirus deaths to other causes of death doesn't make sense:

Imagine a weight lifter who has worked up to a 500 pound max bench press.  That's his absolute limit, he struggles but he can do one full rep at 500 pounds.  He's worked hard to achieve this, and has adapted his entire body to support that massive weight for one single rep.

If I suddenly added 50 pounds to the barbell, what would happen?  He'd drop the weight, possibly injuring or even killing himself if he didn't have a spotter.  This should be common sense to anyone who has ever lifted weights before.  But, using the logic a lot of people use for the coronavirus, people should be saying:

""BUT HE CAN LIFT 500 POUNDS????  ANOTHER 50 IS FUCKING NOTHING!""

We see how dumb that is regarding weight lifting, yet people fail to apply this logic to our society.

Yes, we see tens of thousands of deaths per year in car accidents.  Yes, we see tens of thousands of deaths per year due to the flu.  But those are all things our society, like the weightlifter, have adapted to handle over the years.  We have enough vaccines, treatments, and cultural/economic wherewithal to handle all of those deaths.  They're still tragic, but our society as a whole is not threatened by them.

But the coronavirus?  Add another 1 million deaths in a year from a single, new, fast moving cause, and that's like adding that 50 pounds to the barbell.  No time to adapt, no method to handle the surge, it would be catastrophic.  

So our response, in keeping with the analogy, is to quit benching altogether for a little while.  Yes, the lifter will lose size, he'll lose strength.  When he restarts, he'll probably only be able to hit 300 pounds on his max.  This seems like a big blow, and sucks, but, he'll be able to work his way back up to 500 eventually.  This is much better than saying fuck it, adding that 50 pounds thinking you can handle it, then crushing your windpipe with a 550 pound bar of steel.

And that's what would happen to our countries if we lifted the lockdown too early; we wouldn't be ""saving the economy in exchange for some lives"", we'd be killing the economy even worse than if we'd just walked away for a time."

Wuhan seafood market may not be source of novel virus spreading globally

[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/wuhan-seafood-market-may-not-be-source-novel-virus-spreading-globally](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/wuhan-seafood-market-may-not-be-source-novel-virus-spreading-globally)

The first 41 hospitalized patients who had confirmed infections with what has been dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In the earliest case, the patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no reported link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. ""No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases."" 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace. ""That’s a big number, 13, with no link,"" says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University.

Lucey says if the new data are accurate, the first human infections must have occurred in November 2019—if not earlier—because there is an incubation time between infection and symptoms surfacing. If so, the virus possibly spread silently between people in Wuhan—and perhaps elsewhere—before the cluster of cases from the city’s now-infamous Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was discovered in late December. **""The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace,""** Lucey asserts.

Bin Cao of Capital Medical University, the corresponding author of The Lancet article and a pulmonary specialist, wrote in an email to ScienceInsider that he and his co-authors ""appreciate the criticism"" from Lucey.

""Now It seems clear that \[the\] seafood market is not the only origin of the virus,"" he wrote. ""But to be honest, we still do not know where the virus came from now.""

Lucey notes that the discovery of the coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, a sometimes fatal disease that occurs sporadically, came from a patient in Saudi Arabia in June 2012, although later studies traced it back to an earlier hospital outbreak of unexplained pneumonia in Jordan in April 2012. Stored samples from two people who died in Jordan confirmed they had been infected with the virus. Retrospective analyses of blood samples in China from people and animals—including vendors from other animal markets—may reveal a clear picture of where the 2019-nCoV originated, he suggests.

Imagine the world was not aware of COVID-19 until first outbreak that got the world's attention, South Korea reports strange pneumonia cases from Shincheonji Church. Of course, we know Shincheonji is not the origin. Wuhan Huanan market is probably not the origin either. Follow the epidemiology.

2020-04-03,l-_-p,CanadianInvestor,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/fuea19/financial_times_brookfields_leveraged_complexity/fmc8jl6/,"As we gradually emerge from the shutdowns, quarantines and mourning, we will need to deal as quickly as possible with a financial system that will not be capable of delivering the income streams it has promised or, in its present form, efficiently allocating capital across the global economy. The public shock will turn to anger at failed promises of wealth, or even functionality.

The restructurings that are coming will have to cut away wasteful and self-serving corporate forms, pointless “activity” and opaque “disclosure”. Among the financial structures we do not need any more are highly leveraged holding companies that depend on continuous capital markets access to shuffle debt and interests in operating companies.

The most questionable groups are those which have explicitly or implicitly promised public investors steady streams of dividends from “operating” earnings that appear to come from the revaluation and releveraging of their asset base. The holding companies of these groups collect very high management fees for this asset shuffling.

In recent weeks the public has numbly accepted state and central bank support for banks and corporate finance. There is a revulsion, though, at allowing the bailed-out groups to pay dividends, high executive compensation or management bonuses. This is a mortal threat to the existence of asset shuffling leveraged holding companies.

For several years I have examined the Brookfield group, in particular Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP) and its parent Brookfield Asset Management (BAM).

BIP had more than $56bn in assets at the end of 2019 and, according to chief executive Sam Pollock, “$20bn of capital”. On March 31, BIP’s management changed its corporate form from a Bermuda partnership to a Canadian corporation. BIP says these forms will be “economically” equivalent. BIP, now BIPC, does not have any employees of its own, depending on BAM to be its “service provider”. In the past, Brookfield compared BIP to US Master Limited Partnerships, which pass through dividend income from energy-related assets such as pipelines and gas processing plants.

MLPs have gone out of favour as a group, since under the Trump tax reforms there are fewer advantages to investors from the pass through structure. Also, the perceived value of energy assets has declined with oil and gas prices.

But MLPs and Reits, their pass-through cousins in the property and data centre trades, pay dividends to investors that are less than the cash flows they receive from operations. For example, Magellan Midstream, an energy MLP, last year paid out only about 71 per cent of its cash flows as dividends. Digital Realty, a data centre Reit, paid out about 73 per cent of its cash flow in dividends.

BIP, in contrast, appears to be paying out more in management fees to BAM, dividends to its unit holders, and “incentive distributions” to BAM and its senior management, than it receives as dollars paid in to BIP’s holding company as dividends from its operating subsidiaries.

The difference between cash dividends from operating subsidiaries coming in and fees, incentive payments, and dividends going out appears to be covered by capital markets activity at the holding company level, ie. BIP’s net issuance of equity, debt and preferred shares. A person close to Brookfield stated this analysis was untrue. I refer readers to the “Consolidated Statement Of Cash Flows” in Brookfield’s 2019 annual report, page F-13, if they would like to draw their own conclusions.

In the near future it may be even more difficult to raise or maintain the flow of cash dividends from BIP subsidiaries, such as rail and pipelines in the US or toll roads in Brazil to the BIP holding company, BAM and their outside partners. BIP’s holdings are not reported by country, but Brazilian assets seem to comprise more than a quarter and as much as a third of its total. Since May the Brazilian real has declined by about a third against the US dollar in which BIP reports. There would be similar currency value and forex transfer issues with BIP’s substantial assets in India.

What foresight do BIP shareholders receive for the hundreds of millions of management fees and incentive distributions? Well, on February 10, Mr Pollock said on an investor call that “from a BIP perspective, we do not anticipate any material financial impact from the coronavirus situation and remain optimistic regarding the business outlook for the regions we operate in”.

That comment can be “recycled”."

But a UBI (and other sensible policies like universal healthcare) would help alleviate these people’s pain and stimulate the economy in a way gets people back on their feet.

Even if it had been being used, do you really believe Trump is using it for non-political reasons? The scientific and correct name of the disease is COVID-19 and it's expected of a president to use these standard names. Not using it implies one of two things, either he doesn't know the scientific name or he's using it for propaganda.

And I'm not saying there's anything inherently wrong with him using it, China's blaming the virus on the U.S and one would expect the U.S to do the same. All I'm saying is one has to be in deep denial to believe Trump is saying it because it's ""popular"".

Trump has put Jared Kushner in charge of [almost everything](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/7-jobs-jared-kushner-is-now-doing-for-the-united-states-of-america-6f0a799462ed/), because all he cares about is loyalty and image, and Kushner plays his role well for him.  He's the ""senior adviser"" and because Trump doesn't care about any details, he's back there making all the decisions and just telling Trump what he thinks he needs to know.

1. Jared Kushner is responsible for negotiating peace in the Middle East.
Trump has tasked Kushner with brokering “a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.” “If you can’t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can,” Trump told Kushner at an inauguration event.

2. Jared Kushner is responsible for solving America’s opioid epidemic.
Kushner will be responsible for crafting a strategy to combat “opioid abuse, a regular emphasis for Trump on the campaign trail.” He will oversee a commission devoted to the topic that will be headed by Chris Christie.

3. Jared Kushner is responsible for diplomacy with Mexico.
When Trump was set to deliver a speech on the border wall, Kushner, consulting with Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, re-wrote the speech “to make it less damaging” to bilateral relationships with Mexico. Kushner then went to the Oval Office to brief Trump on the changes, which he ultimately agreed to. Mexican officials told CBS News that “Kushner is now handling everything between the two countries, and personally trying to keep the relationship from disintegrating further.”

4. Jared Kushner is responsible for diplomacy with China.
Kushner is the administration’s point person for diplomacy on China. He had repeatedly met with Chinese diplomats. The New York Times reports that “heavily involved in planning the presidential visit [of Xi Jinping], a senior official said, and took part in a National Security Council meeting… at which North Korea and China were discussed.”

5. Jared Kushner is responsible for reforming care for veterans.
Kushner will also dedicate time to “reimagining Veterans Affairs.” This was also a top priority for Trump on the trail, who repeatedly pledged to take better care of veterans.

6. Jared Kushner is responsible for reforming the criminal justice system.
Kushner traveled to the Capital building this week to represent the administration in a discussion of criminal justice reform with two key Senators, Buzzfeed reported.

7. Jared Kushner is responsible for reinventing the entire government and making it work like a business.
Trump recently put Kushner in charge of the “White House Office of American Innovation.” The new office “is designed to infuse fresh thinking into Washington, float above the daily political grind and create a lasting legacy for a president.” It’s task, according to Kushner is to make the entire U.S. government “run like a great American company.”

Now Kushner is in charge of a shadow Coronavirus task force being run off the books with personal phones and email, which has the president's ear and has precedence over the best doctors and epidemiologists the country has to offer.  Kushner is either so stupid or so sociopathic that he's willing to accept the role and deaths that will come as a direct result of his lack of expertise."

Illinois’ largest public university expects it will cost $37 million to provide room and board refunds to students who left campus early because of the coronavirus outbreak — and additional reimbursements might be on the way.

While the University of Illinois System also projects that canceled events and postponed medical treatments could cost the school $17 million and $15 million, respectively, the refunds for students represent the single largest expense, according to Avijit Ghosh, chief financial officer and comptroller.

“In general, the (financial) impact is broad, significant and ongoing,” Ghosh said Thursday during a virtual meeting with the board of trustees’ executive committee. “We have incurred a significant amount of ... expenses as we have converted academic programs to online education and remote teaching and adapted everybody to remote work.”

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus on Jan. 31, 2020.

The outlook, which Ghosh stressed should only serve as an initial estimate, offers the first glimpse of the pandemic’s financial toll on higher education in Illinois. One area school, MacMurray College in Jacksonville, has already announced it will close for good, in part because of economic strain from the crisis.

Nearly all of the 89,000 students enrolled at U. of I. campuses in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield have moved home to finish their semesters online since the COVID-19 crisis escalated last month. Those who lived in campus dorms or university-owned apartments were urged to leave and can have portions of their fees for housing and meal reimbursed.

About 600 students have remained in residence halls in Chicago and 500 in Urbana-Champaign, according to school chancellors.

Chancellors also indicated that more relief could be provided to students in the near future.

Susan Koch, chancellor of the Springfield campus, said she is “anticipating some additional refund decisions.” She did not elaborate on what the refunds would cover.

""We have provided prorated refunds for housing and dining where appropriate and are examining other refunds,"" she told trustees.

University of Illinois at Chicago Chancellor Michael Amiridis said he was also reviewing whether to offer more refunds for service fees. A school spokeswoman said that could include costs for recreation, student centers, student programming and athletics.




Though unanticipated costs will continue to mount throughout the pandemic, U. of I. stands to gain a portion of the $14 billion set aside for struggling colleges and universities in the recently passed CARES Act.

Ghosh said some reports suggested U. of I. would receive $60 million of the federal stimulus money, which is being allocated by the U.S. Department of Education based on total enrollment and the percentage of low-income students.

But it’s not clear when that money will be distributed, and estimates could change.

“We hope Congress will provide adequate support to universities to overcome the unique challenges we are facing,” Ghosh said. “The $14 billion provided to higher education, the CARES Act, is a start, but not adequate to support universities across the nation.”

Also on Thursday, U. of I. at Urbana-Champaign announced that courses would continue as online only for the summer session. Study abroad programs for the summer had already been canceled."

For us here in the US, we're getting buttfucked by this thing in a lot of different ways:

* Late start to preventive action since we don't got to worry about no dumb hoax flu.
* Wholly inadequate test supplies so we can't even accurately measure the scope of the virus.  A friend of mine just passed away ostensibly from this, and they're not going test him because in the words of the medical examiner, ""we don't even have enough tests for living people"".
* Inconsistent response.  About 20 states still haven't issued stay-at-home orders.  Which ensures that this shit is going to ping-pong around the country for months as different locations are going to be peaking at different times and subsequently sharing the love back with other states.
* Team Fake News.  Between mistrust in the media, an undercurrent of anti-intellectualism, and the fact that a pandemic has been made a political issue, our culture is custom made towards dragging this shit out far longer than we should.

I think that as we roll tests out, it's going to quickly become clear that we ain't even started peaking yet, prompting a new wave of layoffs, and the market is going to act accordingly and go up 500 points because why not."

Clearly making profits off of an organization like Nestle that has no respect for basic human rights is scummy but it was a decision made by their higher ups that the cashier has no control over and probably shouldn't speak about.

Similarly i feel like the response given by the WHO representative is warranted. You wouldn't want the health organization to get themselves involved in politics and for the most part they do what they can to ensure that that notion holds true. The United Nations is meant to be a platform for all countries to as transparently as possible have a platform for solving conflict through negotiation rather than through war. Expecting individual UN bodies to have stances on political issues goes against such a notion. 

Taiwan not being a member of the UN is sadly one of the inefficiencies of the UN and should be discussed at large but the WHO isn't the right place for it."

However, most of those people will probably come from elsewhere in Boeing (as opposed to new-hires) such as the recently-cancelled [XSP](https://spacenews.com/boeing-drops-out-of-darpa-experimental-spaceplane-program/) and [NMA](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-737max-nma/boeings-new-ceo-orders-rethink-on-key-jetliner-project-idUSKBN1ZL2RM) programs.

>« Le confinement est complexe dans les territoires défavorisés comme le nôtre, où il y a beaucoup de familles nombreuses dans des petits logements, des foyers de travailleurs migrants, des bidonvilles », explique l’urgentiste. « On sait que les maladies infectieuses touchent plus durement les plus précaires, car la transmission est plus facile, et qu’ils sont plus difficiles à suivre », poursuit-il.

>Même constat du côté des médecins de «Place santé », un centre de santé associatif situé au cœur de la cité des Francs-Moisins à Saint-Denis. « L’impression que l’on a, c’est que l’épidémie va être exacerbée dans les quartiers populaires où des inégalités de santé existent déjà », dit la coordinatrice du centre, Gwenaëlle Ferré, qui dénombre « plusieurs foyers avec plusieurs cas » de coronavirus.

>Elle observe aussi que, dans les quartiers, beaucoup d’habitants doivent continuer à aller travailler, du fait de leur profession ou de leur statut précaire. « Dans notre patientèle, il y a beaucoup d’aides-soignantes, d’aides à domicile et de travailleuses en Ehpad », qui vont être « très exposées », explique la coordinatrice.

2020-04-03,njrebecca,NCT,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCT/comments/fuhsod/about_nct_2020yearbook/fmczksc/,"Hi! Interesting perspective here. I understand why people are scared of NCT 2020 and having their faves being relegated to ""backup dancers,"" as I've seen a lot of people mentioning/being worried about. 

I'm not super involved in the fandom, I only really participate through this subreddit and sometimes on twitter. But I was under the impression that the NCT 2020 rumors were only started bc of a combination of hints from all three units (and in fact the rumors started with a comment from Jaehyun, who is a 127 member). When Jaehyun mentioned that NCT was preparing for a comeback (3/29), some people said repackage album, some said NCT 2020. When Jisung (3/30) and Jeno (3/31) did audio only VLives, many people suspected perhaps a special Dreamies project and some suspected NCT 2020. It wasn't until Lucas's instalive (3/31) that people started really considering that something like NCT 2020 could be in the works–not because people don't want to believe that WayV can do their own thing, but because it's strange that all three units would be preparing comebacks at the same time. Logistically (and in a business sense too) it would be RIDICULOUS for SM to attempt to handle NCT 127, NCT Dream, and WayV promotions alongside the coronavirus situation AND when also considering that Neozone has been one of 127's biggest comeback projects to date. 

As an OT21 fan, the reason why I'm really excited for the possibility of NCT 2020 is because I want to see some acknowledgement from SM that WayV is part of NCT. I LOVE WayV. They're my favorite unit out of the three, if I had to choose one unit to listen to the rest of my life it would be WayV (sorry Jaehyun). I've been following them ever since debut and I would cry for a full album. But the biggest issue I have personally is that people don't acknowledge WayV as part of NCT. Having an OT21 comeback as NCT 2020 would 100% quell those concerns, and would really shut down those 127/Dream purists who refuse to see WayV as part of NCT. And WayV has plenty of time to release more albums. They've only been debuted for only a little over a year, it's not like there's a time limit for this stuff.

Also let people like what they like. Some people like kpop for the music. And some people like it for the hot guys. Some people like it for the memes. Don't judge! If people wanna see OT21 happen for the interactions, then just let them? You act like the members would have to be forced to sit together for some business-relationship stuff. Don't forget that a lot of the WayV, Dream, and 127 members trained for a long time together and some of them promoted for some time together before being separated. I don't know them personally or anything, but I bet they'd be pretty happy to spend some time with the other members, even if it were for promotions."

A claim that's actually impossible to verify because instead of proposing progressive bills and then compromising with something closer to the center she invariably brings a centrist proposal in order to capitulate and compromise with a much more right leaning final product.

The fact that their best idea to bring up to the republicans was only [going to cover ~20% of private sector workers is telling](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/coronavirus-pelosi-sick-leave.amp.html%3f0p19G=0038)"

https://web.archive.org/web/20200402045528/https://www.phe.gov/about/sns/Pages/default.aspx

That snapshot was from yesterday. It states:

>Strategic National Stockpile is the nation’s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out.

>When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency. Organized for scalable response to a variety of public health threats, this repository contains enough supplies to respond to multiple large-scale emergencies simultaneously.

Now, after editing to conform to Kushner's remarks, it states:

>The Strategic National Stockpile's role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies. Many states have products stockpiled, as well. The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.

EDIT: [This is what Kushner said yesterday](https://www.businessinsider.com/jared-kushner-coronavirus-briefing-federal-stockpiles-blames-states-ventilator-shortages-2020-4):

>When asked about his work with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure states can obtain vital equipment, Kushner said that state officials should not assume that federal stockpiles of equipment are for states' use.

>""You also have a situation where in some states FEMA allocated ventilators to the states, and you have instances where in cities they're running out but the state still has a stockpile. ***And the notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile — it's not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use,"" Kushner said.***

>""So we're encouraging the states to make sure that they're assessing the needs, they're getting the data from their local situations, and then trying to fill it with the supplies that we've given them,"" he said."

The name originated because, well, the virus came from China.  For a pretty long time, the virus was concentrated in Wuhan - and was often called the ""Wuhan Virus"" or the ""Chinese Virus"" by the media (the latter the more common name).  The name was pretty much universal (outside of China) because it pretty clearly reflected the reality that the virus was ravaging China.  By the time serious outbreaks started occurring outside of China, the name was sticking before anyone believed it was a racist term.  Once a name sticks, it takes time for it to disappear.

China has been quite embarrassed by this outbreak, given that they [tried to violently cover it up](https://www.axios.com/timeline-the-early-days-of-chinas-coronavirus-outbreak-and-cover-up-ee65211a-afb6-4641-97b8-353718a5faab.html), [lied to WHO about it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fworld%2Fworld-health-organization-january-tweet-china-human-transmission-coronavirus), and [allowed a massive Lunar New Year migration to remain unhindered](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/chunyun-2020-lunar-new-year-travel-rush-china/index.html)that led the localized outbreak to spread across the nation, all [in violation of the (unenforceable) IHR](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/10/21124881/coronavirus-outbreak-china-li-wenliang-world-health-organization).  They certainly don't want the people there to know that - imagine how America would react if that were our government.  That's where [nonsense like this thing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html) comes from.  Discrimination against Asian-Americans (and Asians in other Western countries) flared because of the coronavirus, which some alleged was related to the name ""Chinese Virus"".  So [China jumped onto the opportunity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates) to minimize its connection to the virus.  The last thing China needs is to have the populace of its democratic trade partners who finance its economy (and thus its stability) start pushing for reparations or an end to the relationship, or to have its own populace see the government's mistakes and resist.  

Hence, many people purposely call it the ""Chinese Virus"" as a way of making a statement against the CCP's wishes.  Some may consider that a success for China - it's far better to have people yelling ""Chinese Virus"" on Reddit than to have people yelling at the government to respond to China's behavior.  But still, that is a large part of the reason the name persists, either directly from people's anger at the CCP or from people who continue to pick up on it because of those people and spread it further without seeing any issue.  It's hard to say whether the allegations of racism reduced the usage of the term enough to cancel out the increases from the people who wanted to use the term to taunt the CCP and hold them accountable.  But there's certainly a lot of political weight behind the term now.

**Coronavirus:**

Coronavirus (which accurately describes what the virus is - a type of coronavirus) is a completely uncontroversial name.  It's an actual word (unlike COVID-19), so it's informally conversational, and it's another name that was used very commonly early and just stuck.

The virus *is* a coronavirus, so it makes sense.  There's no political weight attached to it, so it's safe for anyone to use who doesn't want to attract controversy (maybe *we* don't think about that, but the media does and people hear these things from the media and repeat their term).  The term ""Chinese Virus"" could refer to *any* virus that originated in China, and while there's one of those that's spreading rapidly throughout the world and that's likely what is being spoken about, the term ""coronavirus"" is much more clear.  So all of those things contributed to the term ""coronavirus"" becoming the most widespread name.

""Corona"" is a shorter term (and in informal conversations we pretty much never want to use more characters than we absolutely have to) that still keeps the same clarity.  Although I would imagine the beer company is having a little bit of a PR struggle right now.

**COVID-19:**

That is a more formal sounding name.  In theory, it's the best name (if you're not trying to implicitly complain about China).  The ""19"" comes from ""2019"", meaning it's the strand of coronavirus whose spread begun in 2019.  There are other coronaviruses.

The reason that ""coronavirus"" is used more commonly than ""COVID-19"" despite the fact that ""COVID-19"" is a more clear term is mostly that ""coronavirus"" is easier to say and gained more traction early.

China = Evil, totalitarian regime that murders dissenters, commits genocide and harvests organs, attempts to control and manipulate independent regions (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet), and starts pandemics then tries to cover them up.

Chinese people = blameless, and do not deserve racism. The last time they tried to stand up to the government was the Tiannamen Square massacre where dissenters got ground into paste by tanks and washed down drains.

Yet despite the majority of people in that thread recognizing these obvious facts, you still see people outright supporting the CCP and anyone saying anything anti-CCP getting downvoted into oblivion or their posts removed.

It's too late for the lockdowns to be successful at preventing the spread because we started implementing them too late.

Asymptomatic carriers have been known about for months and it's the reason masks were required in China to go anywhere before and during the lockdown they put us under.

If I tried entering my hotel and they saw me without a mask they'd deny entry. 

This is just our country backtracking and not owning up for their mistake they made saying we don't need masks.

In an Unprecedented move, locked down the entire public transport (trains, intercity buses, metro) network across India on 22nd March. This is Big - none of the western countries (Italy, Canada, US, UK, Germany, )have dared to take this approach so far.

Over 85 districts will all major cities placed under curfew like situation.

The scale of effort and resources that government has poured in merely 2 months against a virus about which no one knew anything is staggering. It has not only earned praise by WHO and US administration but more critically so far it also ensured that despite its 1.3 billion population there are less than 400 cases and less than 10 deaths in India.

But government can't do anything if people continue to behave like selfish, entitled, egotist and ideology driven idiots. In Italy, out of 12500 cases with an outcome the MORTALITY RATE IS 48 %. Corona Virus is THAT dangerous.

ORINDA, Calif. — 
Twenty-seven people at a skilled [nursing facility ](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-01/coronavirus-nursing-home-outbreak-family-fears)in the East Bay city of Orinda have tested positive for coronavirus, in the latest sign of the [dangers such facilities face.](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-03/coronavirus-cases-rise-in-l-a-county)
Contra Costa County health officials said the facility, the 47-bed Orinda Care Center, notified public health officials on Tuesday that two residents were sent to the hospital with symptoms.
Of those who tested positive, 24 are residents and three are staff member. The county has tested all the residents and is testing all staff. Most of the residents are older than 65 and about half are older than 80. Fourteen people at the facility tested negative, and results for others are still pending.
“We are very very concerned,” said Dr. Chris Farnitano, the county’s health officer. “This is a virus without a vaccine. This is a virus without a medical treatment.”
He said the the residents who have tested negative have been separated from those who are infected, and the staff also has separated. Staff who have tested positive have been told to isolate at home, but if they have no symptoms, they may, with protective gear, continue to serve the residents who are also positive.
Orinda is an upscale community bordering the Oakland-Berkeley hills. Franitano said the virus is now in every community in the county.
Nursing homes have been the focus of major concern as the virus spreads, with [outbreaks at facilities across the state.](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-31/more-than-50-infected-with-virus-at-california-nursing-home)
Hospitals are desperately trying to discharge patients to clear space for an expected wave of people infected with COVID-19. But nursing homes are reluctant to accept any new patients — or even returning residents — until it is proved that they are virus-free.

ADVERTISEMENT

On Monday, the California Department of Public Health sided squarely with the hospitals, ordering skilled nursing facilities to accept residents even if they have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. After an outcry from elder advocates, one of whom called the directive “nothing less than a death sentence” for nursing home residents, state officials issued new guidance late Wednesday.
“The final determination lies with the local health department,” the state Department of Public Health said in an email to The Times. “Local public health officers have this authority in an emergency.”
Elder advocates, [who say most nursing homes lack the](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-02/california-coronavirus-cases-deaths) equipment and training to properly quarantine patients with the virus, are not satisfied. Many want the state to set up entirely separate living spaces — such as empty hotels, dormitories or cruise ships — for nursing home residents with the virus.
“The state’s constantly shifting positions are confusing and will lead to bad outcomes,” said Michael Connors, a spokesman for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. “Which guidance are facilities expected to pay attention to?”
The confusing signals come as the number of suspected coronavirus infections at communal living institutions, including nursing homes, is skyrocketing. On Thursday, Los Angeles County officials announced the health department was investigating potential outbreaks at 54 institutions, dozens more than the day before.
Eleven of the 78 people who have died of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County have been nursing home residents, officials said."

Pertinent text:
> Possible origins of the virus

> Based on their genomic sequencing analysis, Andersen and his collaborators concluded that the most likely origins for SARS-CoV-2 followed one of two possible scenarios.

> In one scenario, the virus evolved to its current pathogenic state through natural selection in a non-human host and then jumped to humans. This is how previous coronavirus outbreaks have emerged, with humans contracting the virus after direct exposure to civets (SARS) and camels (MERS). The researchers proposed bats as the most likely reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 as it is very similar to a bat coronavirus. There are no documented cases of direct bat-human transmission, however, suggesting that an intermediate host was likely involved between bats and humans.

> In this scenario, both of the distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2's spike protein -- the RBD portion that binds to cells and the cleavage site that opens the virus up -- would have evolved to their current state prior to entering humans. In this case, the current epidemic would probably have emerged rapidly as soon as humans were infected, as the virus would have already evolved the features that make it pathogenic and able to spread between people.

> In the other proposed scenario, a non-pathogenic version of the virus jumped from an animal host into humans and then evolved to its current pathogenic state within the human population. For instance, some coronaviruses from pangolins, armadillo-like mammals found in Asia and Africa, have an RBD structure very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2. A coronavirus from a pangolin could possibly have been transmitted to a human, either directly or through an intermediary host such as civets or ferrets.

> Then the other distinct spike protein characteristic of SARS-CoV-2, the cleavage site, could have evolved within a human host, possibly via limited undetected circulation in the human population prior to the beginning of the epidemic. The researchers found that the SARS-CoV-2 cleavage site, appears similar to the cleavage sites of strains of bird flu that has been shown to transmit easily between people. SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved such a virulent cleavage site in human cells and soon kicked off the current epidemic, as the coronavirus would possibly have become far more capable of spreading between people.

> Study co-author Andrew Rambaut cautioned that it is difficult if not impossible to know at this point which of the scenarios is most likely. If the SARS-CoV-2 entered humans in its current pathogenic form from an animal source, it raises the probability of future outbreaks, as the illness-causing strain of the virus could still be circulating in the animal population and might once again jump into humans. The chances are lower of a non-pathogenic coronavirus entering the human population and then evolving properties similar to SARS-CoV-2."

Don't get me wrong, I *am* worried about government overreach.  If not here but elsewhere in the country.  People old enough to remember what it was like before 9/11 can attest to there being a very distinct difference between What we put up with before and after.  The Johnstown Flood Tax was a ""temporary, emergency"" tax that was levied upon alcohol sales in the state of Pennsylvania to help rebuild the city of Johnstown after a flood leveled it.  Oddly enough it is believed that the dam that burst 20mi upstream was partially owned by Andrew Carnegie, but that's besides the point.  It never went away and now goes directly into the general fund.  It is not a good idea to give up your rights for the sake of security even if the claim is that it will only be for a little while.  Temporary orders become permanent really quick.  (The Congress under Barack Obama removed the sunset clause in The Patriot Act which required the law be voted on every 4 years to keep it as a temporary law, removal of the clause made it permanent)

>Lets get one thing clear. It is in the main stream media's charter, as a commercial entity, they do not have to tell the truth. The Translation to that stipulation is that they function as nothing more than a propaganda machine. The pharmaceutical companies reported record profit loss with a visible trend into the future due to people no longer getting vaccines because they are unproven and unsafe. This happened 2-3 months before this coronavirus nonsense. This shit has genererated so much fear that the virus doesn't even have to actually exist for people to jump back on the vaccine bandwagon. if shit were actually going down, no one would get any warning until they witnessed people dropping dead in the street.  Now CNN trying to blame trump for the stocks dropping and basically blaming him for the alleged virus spread... it's such a fuckin joke... i know how these entities and people operate, i studied them for 15 years. Odds are unusually high that this whole thing is a fabricated hoax... Wouldn't be the first time they've done something like this to gain more centralized power.

Reads like it came right off of Facebook, but no.  In all reality it comes from a very politically left/neutral/doesn't vote kind of group.  Politics don't matter on the topic really as there are absolute total IDIOTS on all sides of this.

But, I don't know how many days these urns account for, and I dont know if these urns are all treated at the same place or scattered around several businesses around the City. But if we say from January 23rd (when Hubei went on lockdown) to Match 26th (when the interview of the truck driver was published in Caixin Magazine) we are looking at 8122 deaths unrelated to the Coronavirus.

But still, I suspect the number is much lower, because the lockdown would cause there to be less activity and traffic in the city compared to a normal day in 2018. The crime rate dropped in New York during their current outbreak, and this certainly happened in Wuhan. I also suspect there would be way less deaths related to accidents or murders.
So the number is very far from accurate.

Personally, I think the Chinese government is covering up their death number. They tried to cover up the spread of the disease when it was just starting and they have tried to cover up death numbers before throughout history to cover their asses. So it wouldn't surprise me if they did this time too."

No alcohol !  The inventor of the N95 material, Dr. Tsai,  discusses what works to disinfect and retain **function** of the n95 material [HERE.](https://utrf.tennessee.edu/information-faqs-performance-protection-sterilization-of-face-mask-materials/)

There is a layer sandwiched in both N95 and surgical/procedure masks that has an electrostatic property that is easily but invisibly destroyed by alcohol, soap, or bleach.

Repeat: **NO alcohol, NO soap**: it disrupts the electrostatic property of the mask, dramatically reducing the EF (effective filtration) against airborne particles.

There are a BUNCH of YouTube videos describing soap and alcohol to disinfect masks. Yeah, it disinfects them like a countertop or drapes, but destroys their ability to filter particles like airborne droplets, leaving a false sense of safety.

Acceptable methods home users likely have access to:

* Dry heat: 70C/160F for 30 minutes. Home oven on lowest setting may get this low. My oven only goes to 170F, but that's fine, I tried it multiple times. (NOT ""proof"" setting, that's how you grow yeast, definitely not hot enough to kill virus.) I used a known-calibrated set of thermometers and IR thermometers to test various in-oven methods.
* Oven Note: Keep mask 6"" away from walls, floor, top of oven to avoid overheating. Dr.Tsai recommends keeping from touching all metal. I used a silicone mat, bamboo steamer rack, and a glass pie dish to slow heat conduction in an experiment with no deformation.
* Microwave Generated Steam: used by some hospitals now as the N95 mask usually makes it through multiple disinfections before de-laminating or the foam nose piece comes off. I tried it, the aluminum did NOT spark in my 1,250 W microwave and I used a baby bottle sanitizing chamber. I was also able to get similar results with a microwave lidded vegetable steamer.
* Steam: eg:Steamer basket, 5 minutes. I used this, too, with no deformation. Must be let dry. I bet a steam basket in a rice cooker for 5 minutes works, too.
* Boil: IF the mask does NOT have a paper layer, Dr.Tsai said it could be boiled for 5 minutes without stirring. I have not tried this. Must be let dry.
* Surgery / Procedure masks have a **steel** wire: it WILL spark and melt and catch fire in a microwave, so you're left with a dry oven or steam for these.
* Temporal disinfection. Needs 4+ masks / person, rotated so the virus inactivates. On the other hand, they found virus on the cruise ship 17 days later.

Impractical methods for most home users:

* UV-C. This is not just a black light, Wood's lamp, nail polish hardener, but UV-C. Dr. Tsai said that 3 months of UV broke down the masks, and it is also unknown how far UV-C penetrates the fibers to sanitize. This is being used in hospitals, but a home oven is far easier.
* Hydrogen Peroxide vapor: $$$, hospital equipment.
* Gamma radiation: big hospitals, may destroy electrostatic property.
* Electrolyzed water: aka Vetericyn. $$$. Hospitals may have this equipment.
* Unknown: CPAP ozone disinfectants. It's about the electrostatic layer, I don't know if it's been studied.
* Pressure cooker / autoclaves deform the masks, making them not fit.

It's pretty important if people are getting a false sense of security and walking around with a mask no better than a napkin. No alcohol. No soap.

Cloth masks, while less effective, can be laundered with soap and run in a dryer cycle over 160F to completely disinfect.

(I'm trying to stretch the supply of masks and keep people safe. I have tried for days to get this on the r/coronavirus thread and bots/mods keep pulling it. r/madisonwi bot auto-yanks it, too. I am just trying to help, and am about to give up.)"

Hear me out. 

The presumption is that the Coronavirus was a deliberate (but subtle) attack or, at the very least, ""test the defenses."" This view then basically demands that Trump retaliate in some way. IF this view is true, there is no other option. Trump must retaliate. So,  . . . how? And, perhaps more important, what would happen afterwards?

My question has been that IF this was deliberate and IF Trump would retaliate, how would he do so? I think it would be as silent and stealthy as possible. I do not think Trump wants to provoke a shooting war but he cannot let an attack, if this was one, pass without response

So, what would things look like if a response was underway or being prepared in the very near future?

Hang on:

First: Get Americans largely home and stocked up on necessities, water, meds. 

DONE

Second: Begin a transition of business from serving peacetime consumer needs to war-related production.

DONE or in process

Third: Recall Americans from abroad.

DONE


Fourth: Pre-position hospital ships/meds/beds near anticipated high casualty areas.

DONE

Fifth: Aggressively enforce military chain of command/reporting procedures. Punish anyone who violates said chain immediately (carrier captain who was sacked).

Sixth: Surge military forces away from homeland. 

DONE with the Venezuelan ""drug interdiction.""

14) Seventh: Make sure Russkies are neutral and informed. No accidental war.

DONE. Could be what Trump & Pootie poot were really discussing.

Eighth: Call out corporate traitors (3M).

The last person infected probably has had  contact with other employees , because usually they make sure to mention if they have had no contact with other employees and the days. 

On the positive side , my agency has disclosed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the  new Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act.  It will be available from April to the end of December.

You get 80 hours of Paid Sick Leave at your regular rate  if you are quarantined and unable to work or have the symptoms of covid 19.

 80 hours at 2/3 of your rate to take care of an individual who has been quarantined or to care for minor children whose school are closed.

This will not affect any of your regular sick leave or vacation leave balance.

If you are intermittent or temporary , under the FFCRA.

You get up to 10 days workdays of unpaid leave , (they can use the Emergency Paid Sick Leave or Annual leave to cover those days)

Up to 10 weeks of paid extended family and medical leave at 2/3 of the employees regular rate,

Interesting that people who are not permanent appoint  can get up to 10 weeks of paid extended family leave.  I guess since they don't have as much security and most employees don't meet the criteria they can afford to be generous .

I am happy , I don't have any kids but I think is a nice alternative for parents who may need to take a small break from working to focus on their kids for a couple of weeks."

The amount of blind vitriol is crazy on this topic. The issue is that students are going to be learning at home for a while and so students aren't going to be able to meet the goals laid out in their Individual Education Program (IEP). An IEP is a legally binding document and failing to adequately educate students in accordance with the plan (or making insufficient effort) can lead to lawsuits and districts could lose a lot of money because of a pandemic. The reason that students are in special education is that general education has failed them already, so they need more specialized and intense services. These are basically impossible during a shelter in place order. I'm not sure what school districts can do besides send some work home, offer telelearning, and hope for the best. And apparently, to some people, allowing districts to not meet IEP goals during a pandemic makes De Vos history's greatest monster. Now some districts will no doubt abuse this, but we don't design an emergency systems to read the minds of districts that will misuse this. Yes, advocacy groups are going to complain because that's their job. But from my perspective as a special educator, this is reasonable and makes good policy.

***From the story, from local government reporters*** [***Joey Flechas***](https://twitter.com/joeflech#storylink=authorcard) ***and*** [***Doug Hanks***](https://twitter.com/doug_hanks)***:***

After Miami Mayor Francis Suarez called on President Donald Trump to [halt flights into the Miami area](https://twitter.com/AndySlater/status/1245873551594393600) from coronavirus “hot spots,” the county mayor with authority over local airports said he told the White House to “disregard” the Suarez letter.

“It’s not his purview,” said Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, who has authority over Miami International Airport, a county agency. Gimenez noted passenger flights are also important parts of the supply chain, hauling cargo in and out of Miami, which is a global hub for pharmaceutical shipments.

“I’ve already spoken to the White House about it and said disregard the letter,” Gimenez said during an online press conference Friday. “It’s Miami-Dade County that controls MIA.”

On Thursday night, Suarez sent a letter to Trump urging him to immediately halt flights into Miami from “COVID-19 hotspots” in the United States and around the world. After Gimenez’s rebuke at a Friday press conference, Suarez said the county mayor should be calling for aggressive action at MIA.

“It’s unfortunate that at a time when unity is needed, Mayor Gimenez has refused to join me in asking the President to suspend flights from COVID hotspots,” Suarez said in a statement.

The dueling statements show the coronavirus has only amplified a longstanding rift between Miami-Dade’s two leading elected leaders. Gimenez and Suarez were divided early on coronavirus, when [Miami canceled the Ultra music festival ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andreabossi/2020/03/07/coronavirus-concerns-cancel-miami-music-festival-ultra-music-festival/#3fa60a21577b)and Calle Ocho street parties in early March. Miami-Dade had no discovered cases then, and Gimenez cited a [low risk to the public](https://www.miamiherald.com/article240927291.html) at that time. “We would not have canceled it,” Gimenez, a Republican candidate for Congress, told WIOD on March 6."

There’s several theories about potential mechanisms of the various treatments under study - and I don’t think any other them are really conducive to an ELI5. 

As simply as I can explain, it’s hypothesized that the coronavirus creates a lot of cellular/protein trash when it’s infecting cells, that trash interferes with red blood cells carrying oxygen, and the antimalarials help clean up the trash. That helps the immune system focus on the virus instead of the by-products, and keeps the patient stronger by preserving oxygen flow."

You have yet to give me any evidence that it is true. I am open to hearing your evidence, You claimed that I ""Haven't bothered to investigate the evidence"". I already pointed out that that was false, but that does not mean that I am unwilling to give it another look. 

So rather than just asserting that it is true, convince me! give me your best evidence!

> The economy is real, but you can’t see how it works or predict what will happen. How is that different?

You absolutely can make *some* predictions about the economy. Depending on the specific prediction, they often have a high margin of error, but to give one example, one investor made $26 billion dollars by anticipating how the stock market would react to the coronavirus outbreak. 

The difference is that the economy is driven by *real* forces that have actual cause and effect relationship. The economy is hard to predict because of the sheer number of variables, but you can still make broad predictions with a certain degree of confidence. 

That isn't the case with astrology. [Your doctor had a larger gravitational effect on you as a baby than the planets did.](http://www.smarterthanthat.com/astronomy/astrology-a-practical-test-objects-that-affect-you-at-birth/) So did many, many other things in your hospital room. There is no cause and effect relation ship that we can explore in astrology, because there is no proposed causal relationship that even makes sense."

Jag har nästan tvångsmässigt följt utvecklingen sedan februari eftersom det eventuellt kunde påverka en arbetsresa, det började med ett genuint intresse för det nya coronaviruset och har övergått till en oro för mina medmänniskor. Kanske ni tänker ""ja, inte vill han smitta någon annan"" eller ""vilken hypokondriker!"".

Jag har tänkt så tidigare men efter allt jag läst och alla de kommentarer som kommer in till SVT, Aftonbladet eller här på reddit så är min största oro andra människor.

Jag struntar i om du är ung, gammal, utbildad eller inte, det jag ser på min arbetsplats i samhället och online skrämmer mig.
Jag har ett stort förtroende för vad folkhälsomyndigheten rekommenderar. Ja jag har till och med förtroende för samtliga partier i riksdagen som sluter upp bakom regeringen i denna tid av kris.

Många frågor som ställs online eller spekulationer om att det finns botemedel hit och dit, om viruset är skapat av människor, eller om vilken strategi som är rätt eller fel, gör mig illamående.

Jag respekterar folks åsikter men jag hade aldrig trott att vi här i Sverige skulle vara så lättpåverkade av desinformation och ryktesspridning.

Det finns ingen konspiration. Viruset är inte ""levande"" utan sprider som virus i allmänhet gör. Det är inte ett nytt virus utan en variant av tidigare coronavirus. Det är sinneslöst smittande och du ska undvika sociala kontakter samt hålla god handhygien. Mer än så är det inte. Det finns ingen ""högre makt"" som satt igång det här, alla länder drabbas och drabbas olika beroende på vilka förutsättningar som finns.

Folkhälsomyndigheten har hundratals experter som ägnat sina liv till att lära sig om hur man bäst skyddar samhället från olika smittor och sjukdomar. Bara för att du tycker att skolorna ska stänga så betyder inte det att det är det bästa alternativet. Jag kanske låter hård men Sverige har en så sjukt stor transparens när det kommer till politik och myndigheter att gissningar om läget från myndighetshåll skulle leda till tvingad tjänsteledighet eller uppsägning om det avslöjades. Om du tycker att du vet bättre än MSB, Folkhälsomyndigheten och Socialstyrelsen kan jag sätta pengar på att du inte har en aning om vad du snackar om.

Det finns heller inget som tyder på att Sverige mörkar hur illa situationen är.
har man lyssnat på Folkhälsomyndigheten med Tegnell i spetsen så säger man att vi kommer att få fler fall, fler kommer att dö och vi är troligtvis bara i början av utbrottet.

Statsministern säger att vi kommer att räkna de döda i tusentals.

Utöver det är folk så otroligt fixerade vid gränsstängingar och ökad testning samtidigt som att det är uppenbart att gränsstängningar inte hjälper när smittan redan finns i stora delar av varje angränsande land. Folk verkar inte vilja fatta att smittan finns i hela landet redan. Testkapaciteten håller på att byggas upp och långsiktigt är det bra, framförallt ekonomiskt. 
Samtidigt finns det folk som tänker att de bekräftade fallen speglar hur många som är smittade i landet vilket är helt felaktigt.

Man ställer sig frågan "" hur kommer det sig att Sverige har så många döda när vi bara har 6000 bekräftade fall!?""

Einstein, vi har inte testat tillräckligt och den slutsatsen du kan dra är att det just nu är betydligt fler med smittan i samhället som inte diagnostiserats. Så som det låter kan siffran vara mellan fem och tio gånger fler än vad vi har bekräftade fall, ni ser jag kan inte låta bli att spekulera.

Gång på gång har man varnat att detta är allvarligt och att varje medborgare ska ta sitt ansvar genom att undvika folkmassor, gamla speciellt och hålla god handhygien. Vad mer behöver dessa människor höra?

Är du frisk och har möjlighet då går du till jobbet, annars stannar du hemma. Du kan till och med frivilligt sätta dig i karantän och samhället kommer tacka dig med slopad karensdag och annat stöd.

Om man verkligen lyssnar på de presskonferenser som sänds på TV så upplever jag att man får en träffsäker bild av läget. Är man riktigt uppmärksam förstår man att läget är allvarligt. Säger man det inte rakt ut så finns det där ändå.

  * Ekonomin är fucked för några år framöver.
  * Tusentals kommer att dö.
  * Sjukvården har ingen uthållighet, ""allt som kommer in skickas ut"".
  * MSB flaggar för desinformation.
  * Är du i riskgrupp, sätt dig i karantän.
  * Har du det minsta symptom, stanna i ditt hem!

Behöver du en lag för att följa ovanstående så har du inte fattat någonting."

So I followed up and read the update to the initial publication as linked by this video. The problems with the initial study persist in this update as well. Obviously there are promising things in there, but these reports should not be taken as confirmation of efficacy. The data that was covered in the youtube video, for example, does not include a comparison to untreated individuals in the publication. That is just the percent of PCR-positive patients in only the treated group; that data on its own is meaningless. The original publication by this group did include untreated individuals as controls (still not a blinded study but better), so I'm confused as to why they didn't include the comparison in this update. Additionally, the only piece of data that they have is that PCR test. That assay is obviously the workhorse assay for clinical detection of the disease, but it alone does not offer too much information. At this point we only have preliminary reports on a small number of patients, with a single assay readout, seemingly without adequate controls. It's just too soon to accept this as an efficacious treatment and prescribe it widely.    


 As for the supply, I hadn't seen that Israel was helping. Obviously that's great, but I still think Doctors should exercise restraint in prescription of these drugs for coronavirus. At this point, it seems more appropriate to treat patients with it in controlled, expanded studies rather than to have every individual Doctor prescribing it off-label to their personal patients at large scale."

But she asked families to make sure to contact her office in cases of death from illness, if no coronavirus test had already been done. Her office has performed 10 post-mortem COVID-19 tests, she said.

However many deaths are missed, the number of confirmed deaths has been rising sharply and is expected to continue to go up.

Florida's death count exceeds projections by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which produces closely watched forecasts of death tolls at the state and national levels. That model, which is being used by the White House, projected there would be 121 deaths in Florida by Thursday. As of 11 a.m. that day, Florida had reported 128 deaths.

The latest projection shows about 175 Floridians will die a day at the epidemic’s peak on May 5, reaching a total of 6,897 deaths by August. The Washington model is considered conservative because it assumes people will slow the spread of the virus by fully complying with social-distancing measures."

>	That’s where the rapid test differs from the others in use right now; with the traditional technology, that amplification process requires repeatedly cycling the temperature of the chemical reactions from low to medium to high and back down again. The ID NOW device can perform the genetic expansion at a constant temperature, which means it can spit out results more quickly.

>	So why aren’t all COVID-19 tests run using the faster technology? One reason has to do with volume; traditional genetic tests can process hundreds or even thousands of tests a day; the ID NOW system can only run about four samples an hour. And while traditional tests may take longer to produce results, researchers don’t need to spend as much time developing the test itself so it can start testing people sooner. The rapid test “takes quite a bit of optimization and refining,” says John Frels, vice president of research and development at Abbott Diagnostics. That means it requires more up front development time and takes longer to get up and running.

El aparato es como una impresora. Hay que comprar cartuchos especiales para el virus SARS-CoV-2. Cada aparato da el resultado en 15 minutos, sí, pero es uno cada quince minutos. Las pruebas tradicionales tardan varias horas pero podemos hacer 100-1000 por “tanda”.

Coronavirus is transmitted, among other ways, through droplet infection. Secretions from the mouth (consisting of saliva and mucus) and nose can contain the virus. Even if you don't kiss the person you are having sex with, you are likely to be breathing closely together. You are likely to be touching the same surfaces, which someone could have touched with soiled fingers. Therefore, it doesn't much matter if coronavirus can be transmitted through sex.

So far we've had 273,000 cases of SARS Coronavirus in the US with 7,000 deaths. 

The swine flu infected 63,000,000 and under 20,000 died. This disease is just as, if not more infectious than the flu and is far more deadly. 

That math is absolutely staggering. Doctors think we would be lucky to hold the death toll to under 200,000. Up until part way through March, Trump called the virus a fucking hoax and claimed that it was something the Democrats were using to get him voted out of office. 

He knew the dangers and he was told how to handle the dangers of a pandemic. Instead of heeding the warning by the CDC, he dismantled the pandemic response team because it was an Obama era force specifically designed to curb mass outbreaks.

Now that his supporters largely think that this is all very silly, he is partly responsible for a lackluster response to a serious issue.

China claims sovereignty over the island, although Taiwan has its own government and refers to itself as the Republic of China.

In the meantime Taiwan has handled the Pandemic really well without WHO's help and has been calling out China's cover up's and lies since the begining of the outbreak.

2020-04-03,Saberleaf,Parahumans,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/fufr8b/thoughts_on_victorias_plan/fmcnfe1/,"I absolutely love this. You put a lot of my feelings on this into words really well. I admire your writing talent.

That being said, I want to chip in as someone who ""been there almost done that"". I think that this story arc is awfully timed. With the coronavirus and future/present being more uncertain than ever a lot of people are overcome with their depression/anxiety or even developing them. Worries how they will feed their family, themselves, if they will have a job, etc. are a great feeding ground for suicidal thoughts which makes a story that treats suicide as a positive thing even more sensitive than it would be a month ago or maybe even 2 months from now.

But let's not forget, Parahumans have a subjective narrator. Taylor made us believe that infanticide is the right choice (I'm not making a judgement on that, just putting it into perspective). Victoria's view isn't absolute, isn't objective, isn't ""true"". She sees the world through her lense. She believes this to be the right choice but it's been established that others don't. They sort of give in under pressure but they're not on-board so to speak. 

I'm pretty sure WB doesn't want us to think it's the right choice by showing us the Damsel scene. It's beyond messed up and it further shows how much have the heroes sunk.

However, as another show stated, being in your lowest point opens your mind to greatest change. I believe the intention is to show that the heroes CAN climb from this. They can improve even from suicidal ideation, even from attempted suicide.

I believe that the final message won't be suicide = good but that even the best of us can be suicidal but it's not the end. You can get better, you can improve even from that kind of low and enjoy life again.

That being said, I think a lot of stories wrongly don't show this aspect. A lot of stories brush this kind of mindspace off completely and go from ""she is sad"" to ""she attempted suicide"" to ""she is better now"" but that doesn't happen in real life. Real people go through stages, they go through being convinced it's the right thing into learning the value of their lives with a lot in-between.

Real people go through what Victoria is feeling. Yes, she's adoring the idea of mass suicide and manipulating people towards that. She's doing the right thing yet no one knows if it even will work out, she has support yet a lot of people who have joined have doubts or were forced, she's convincing people she's right yet these people really don't absolutely believe her but can't stop her.

In Victoria's eyes, she's doing the only thing she can. In everyone else's eyes, this is really messed up.

And that's an important message to deliver. The conviction, the manipulation, the twisted view on ethics and heroism.

Hopefully, there will come a very necessary awakening.

And, honestly, if it goes the way I expect, it will be the first time that I will say I love Ward. Because this message needs to be said. The message about twisted perception and healing from it. It really doesn't get said in conventional stories.

What bothers me a lot is not the text but how fast are real people praising this as heroic sacrifice. That sends chills down my spine tbh."

Lots of relevant information to be found displayed in a useful manner. [Here's Michigan's counterpart to it.](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163-520743--,00.html) One of the few states receiving a ""B"" for data grade by the Covid Traking Project. Sorry for referencing Michigan so much by the way; I'm a Michigander so those specific abysmal numbers hit a bit close to home.

I agree and disagree with you about population, but firstly I want to appreciate the effort you put into that comment. Stuff like that keeps the sub a place I continue to want to be.

>In other words, to the extent factors are modifying the number of patient zeros, or the R0 of a virus within a country, it's those factors, and not the population size, that matters.

You're right. In the presence of perfect data it would absolutely make the most sense to judge the responses of different states/countries based on the number of patient zeros that had entered the state/country. If we had that information we could much more accurately judge which responses were the best or worst. In the absence of that information however population has been used as a stand-in. A state with greater population is more likely to have more major airports, interstate commerce, and general travel from foreign countries. These factors would contribute to having a likely greater number of patient zeros. As demonstrated in your post, citing Hong Kong, there is absolutely not a perfect correlation between population size and this number, in fact I would wager the correlation is very loose because of the tremendous number of variables at play, but there *is* some correlation. I would conclude that in the absence of perfect data both absolute and per-capita charts are largely imperfect depictions of the epidemic and that both should be viewed knowing their context and with the above considerations in mind.

The data for those Politico graphs are actually sourced from the Tracking Project I linked. I've been watching them as well. Personally I prefer looking at the graphs towards the bottom rather than playing with the slider to get a feel for the growth of cases/testing."

Certainly the coronavirus has shocked everyone. Certainly countries will be looking to secure their medical supplies in the future. And certainly there will be anger towards China. 

But the underlying math that drove everyone to to China in the first place has not changed. Companies offshored production because it was cheaper, more efficient, and more profitable. In other words, moving production back is going to be expensive, inefficient, and not profitable. And remember that the coronavirus is also wreaking incredible economic damage alongside all the health–is there really going to be a lot of appetite for companies and governments to pile on more damage on top of that? 

No, what I expect is an acceleration of the existing trend towards moving supply chains partially out of China to SE Asia and Africa. China itself has been leading this movement as domestic labor costs have risen, and is looking for a ""China"" of its own."

Most criticism stemmed from it being too little too late. And the fact that other countries were effected but weren't banned as well so focusing only on china is xenophobic since he didn't do the same for Italy and other countries which were as bad or worse.

>while leading Democrats have been outspoken in their criticism of the president’s overall response to the epidemic, very few have criticized his decision to impose limited travel restrictions.

>In a Feb. 4 letter to Trump, Democratic Reps. Nita Lowey, chair of the Appropriations Committee, and Rose DeLauro, chair of one of the subcommittees, wrote that they “strongly support” the president’s decision to declare a public health emergency in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak, and they specifically cited the administration’s actions to impose “significant travel restrictions.”

>On the day Trump imposed the travel restrictions, Biden did criticize Trump for his “record of hysteria and xenophobia,” but it is unclear whether Biden was referring to Trump’s travel restrictions, or Trump’s overall qualifications to deal with the epidemic. 

Which to be fair is valid criticism

Hope that helps!

The premise of the case is that Fox News endangered the lives of people by downplaying the severity of Covid-19.  “Defendants acted in bad faith to willfully and maliciously disseminate false information denying and minimizing the danger posed by the spread of the novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19, which is now recognized as an international pandemic,” the suit says. The group argues that speech that endangers the community is not protected by The First Amendment.

The article does not contain a comment from The Fox Network but does quote Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law and an expert on so-called SLAPP lawsuits. SLAPP is an acronym for strategic lawsuit against public participation, which is a lawsuit brought only with the intention of intimidating, not winning.

I could easily be wrong, and forgive me if I am and you've thoroughly researched this already, but in order to kill coronavirus you need A very specific and intense range of UV light, and not just any uv.

Your best bet is to leave things quarantined in the garage for 5 days or so. If you use disinfectant, make sure you read the directions for how long it needs to be left on and wet to work.  Be sure to really get things wetted down as well. Soap and water also works if it's something sealed.

But yeah, frequently handled objects, that does present a challenge. I considered buying a UV light myself for things I can't disinfect, but want quicker access to and I just didn't see anything that seemed legit and trustworthy with my life and the lives of those I care for.

At least nothing that wouldn't be cost prohibitive.

If you have more info that direction though I'd be interested in hearing it.

I'm staying the fuck at home and only going out as needed every few weeks so what I do is just put my phone in a Ziploc if I need to use it when at the grocery store. Same thing with credit cards or cash. 

 When I get home I leave the cash and cards in the bag for like 5 days, because I don't need it anyway for another week. That'll take care of any virus I transferred to cards or cash. My phone was in a Ziploc unhandled so that's fine. Clothes, shoes, I remove those in the garage as well.

> Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa, they can’t even count. No they can’t. They can’t count their votes.

>One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. **And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We’re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.**

He pretended like democrats were exaggerating the risk of the virus. And he downplayed the threat himself:


> “You may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country. We have very few people with it, and the people that have it are … getting better. They’re all getting better. … As far as what we’re doing with the new virus, I think that we’re doing a great job.”

One even made a joke that she probably infected the whole office. Unsurprisingly, my office does have confirmed cases which is why our building is basically condemned for the next 2 weeks. So there’s really no way to enforce or police this type thing you’re suggesting. It would have to be on the honor system and assuming that most people would be honorable is not a good assumption. 


Then there are other people who are very mildly symptomatic but then brush it off as “something else that isn’t coronavirus” who chalk it up to temporary allergies or whatever else. They believe they are essentially asymptomatic and aren’t meaning to be superspreaders like the ones above but nonetheless do indeed have the virus. 


And finally there are people who might truly have no symptoms that they are aware of and could still be spreading it anyway (although probably less so than the two groups mentioned above).  


So while I get where you’re coming from, I don’t think this would be a viable plan. And it would probably cause even more public panic to have called plagued and non-plagued hours so to speak."

J'ai été contrôlé et verbalisé par des gendarmes à moto lundi 23 mars à 12h15 (juste avant l'entrée en vigueur du décret du Premier Ministre du 23 mars publié au journal officiel le 24 mars).

Lors d'une sortie de marche à pied.

Voici ce qui est indiqué sur le pdf :

> Prévue par Art. 1 du décret 2020-260 du 16-03-2020.

> Réprimée par Art. 1 du décret 2020-264 du 17-03-2020.

J'était à 1,3km de mon domicile à pied (le gendarme a vérifié sur son smartphone), je suppose qu'à vol d'oiseau j'étsis + près.

Il m'a parlé d'une distance maxi de 500m du domicile à l'époque (après le 24 mars c'est 1km). Etait-ce vrai ? Je ne trouve pas cette distance maxi de 500m dans le décret du 16 mars.

D'après [cet article de Capital.fr](https://www.capital.fr/economie-politique/controle-du-confinement-il-est-possible-de-contester-les-amendes-1366470) et [celui là peu clair du Parisien](http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/coronavirus-comment-contester-une-amende-pour-non-respect-du-confinement-01-04-2020-8291907.php) ""Vous devez envoyer un courrier recommandé avec des justificatifs pour appuyer votre demande à un officier du ministère du public dans les 45 jours qui suivent la verbalisation""

(a priori on peut contester sur www.antai.gouv.fr ou envoyer un courrier à Rennes.

Or les Postes sont fermées autour de chez moi :(

People avoided me on the train to work. and if I cough for no reason other than my throat is dry, people look at me for no other reason than I'm asian (because they certainly didnt look or move away when a white person did the same)

In that article a Manchester University student said,

That is how we perceive it. The racism and isolation we experience on an increasing basis day to day is rooted in the perception of a virus as associated with ""chinese"" people. There's no numbers for this, because asians, due to their low statistical prevalence, are left out of opinion polls. In fact [look here](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/03/27/racism-covid-poll) asian americans are left out a poll on asian american racism. it's brilliant. there's no racism if you never study it.

And what is common to all of this: ""coronavirus"". Not one of these assaults do you have someone going out and calling out ""COVID19!"" it's because they have engrafted in their mind a wrong perception of this as ""the chinese virus."" The fact is asian communities are hurt by the constant naming of ""chinese virus"" or ""chinese coronavirus"" instead of COVID19 doesn't matter if its here or canada, or the UK

also you're flat out wrong about there not being stigma from ebola. maybe not from you but it did happen, [even in europe](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/10/30/berlin-immigrants-ebola-racism-africa/18187819/) ""In Germany, soccer fans chanted ""Ebola, Ebola"" when Charles Atsina, a black player from Ghana, came onto the field to play.""  and that is certainly racist. If you were to come here and I were to go ""FRANCE FRANCE FRANCE"" every time i saw you, that would certainly be discriminatory, and not even properly descriptive. 

the christian response is best outlined here: https://www.chinapartnership.org/blog/2020/4/my-chinese-and-asian-american-friends-are-afraid-of-rising-xenophobia-how-will-the-church-respond

>Many of my friends expressed, not surprise, but concern over the president persistently referring to COVID-19 as “The Chinese Virus.” They understand the geopolitical struggle between the U.S. and China. They also understand that this rhetoric is part of the propaganda war between our nations. But they - along with many other Asians in their social networks - are deeply concerned about how Americans will begin to perceive Chinese (and other Asians they meet) because of this and that this renaming might also fuel the nationalism and xenophobia that was already growing around the world.

We are worried because we see these cases viewed by political rhetoric, especially the assoication of a virus with ethnicity through its name and therefore, most professionals argue against naming viruses after places now, and because COVID19 has a non-place name, to use a place name in describing nCOV2019 is perceived by the people it most impacts as racist.

again maybe you dont perceive it as racist, but the fact is people of asian ethnicity living in western countries do"

I disagree that contacting the city commissioner is going to help you in the immediate, but a housing/tenant's attorney. They can communicate to the property management that they will be on the hook for the cost and hopefully back down in the immediate.

I suggest you go to China and make some Chinese friends after the coronavirus travel ban. Go talk to us and try to understand our way of thinking. Before I come to the US, I can't understand why a drug addict even has fans ( drug addicts should never show on public), and why people do not listen to the government and take the mask. Now I know. The first thing some of you guys pop out is human rights, not health. ""Government banned people hang out! Where's my fucking human rights! ""

&#x200B;

Same as your topic talks about.

CCP: ""In order to show our respect to those people who fight for coronavirus, we decide to ban any online entertainment activities.""

Some of you guys: ""The fucking Chinese government is raping human rights! They are violating the rights to watch funny videos!""

Us: ""Salute to doctors, salute to nurses, salute to those who died in coronavirus.""

By the way, in traditions, we are not allowed to do anything about entertainment at the Qingming Festival. It should be a very serious ""holiday.""

Remember last year Brunei [temporarily stopped](http://www.newagebd.net/article/87196/brunei-sultan-unhappy-over-syndicates-involvement) work visa to Bangladeshi workers due to syndicate visa scams? Syndicates bribed Bruneian officials and bringing in Bangladeshi workers telling them there is job but actually none. These workers came to Brunei and got stuck, they paid huge money to these syndicates for jobs in Brunei  but ended up scammed.

The amount is numerous, [31 companies](https://www.newagebd.net/article/91484/9-bangladeshi-human-traffickers-deported-from-brunei) got blacklisted for involving in Bangladeshi visa scam. Nobody knows the exact amount of workers they brought in.

Some Bangladeshi workers decided there is nothing left for them going back Bangladesh since they have sold off assets to raise money paying syndicates to come Brunei for jobs, and it is better trying out their luck in Brunei. So they become illegals.

Now the problem comes. 7 Bangladeshis have been tested positive in Brunei so far, but Bangladeshi officials said [the real figures might be higher](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/brunei/viewtopic.php?p=158#p158), because illegals are hiding and refused to come out to be tested for fear of arrest.

Worse is... according to Bangladesh High Comm, about **25,000 Bangladeshis are staying in Brunei. Of them, 90 per cent  were cheated by human traffickers.** So, they have no legal documents like  visas and passports. If COVID-19 is spreading among these people, it would be disastrous.

Their living condition is not good. At least 20-25 workers are living in a room. So, if any worker is infected with coronavirus, then all of them will be at high risk of contamination, and it will spread fast."

She was 33.

Her husband, Levon Aronian, a grandmaster ranked No. 7 in the world, announced her death on Twitter. Ms. Caoili died two weeks after being seriously injured in a car crash.

In the insular world of chess, Ms. Caoili (pronounced kay-OH-lee), who had done some modeling when she young, stood out — not only for her talents as a player but also for the glamour she brought to what is often thought of as an unglamorous game.

After her death, condolences poured in from every top chess player in the world, including Magnus Carlsen, the world champion, and Garry Kasparov, the former world champion.

Nikol Pashinyan, Armenia’s prime minister, also offered condolences on his website. “Her memory,” he wrote, “will remain bright in the hearts of the Armenian people.”

Ms. Caoili’s first major international victory was in 2000, when she won the Asian Girls Under-16 Championship tournament in Bagac, the Philippines, on her 14th birthday. She went on to win the London Chess Classic Women’s Invitational in 2009 and, that same year, the Oceania Women’s Zonal, a qualifier for the world championship.

She played seven times in the Chess Olympiad, the game’s pre-eminent international team event. She represented her native Philippines in 1998 and 2000 and, after moving, represented Australia in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012. She was awarded the title women’s international master by the World Chess Federation, the game’s governing body.

She had done some modeling while living in Australia, and, in 2006 she was a contestant on the Australian version of “Dancing With the Stars.” She and her partner, the dancer and choreographer Carmelo Pizzino, finished second.

She was fluent in several languages and had studied for a Ph.D. in economics.

In recent years, she had concentrated on business more than on competing. When she was 29 she started Champord, a free weekly newspaper for commuters in Yerevan; the same year, she founded a consultancy firm called Akron, which focused on public policy, economics and sovereign wealth funds.

Ms. Caoili was also known for her charity work. In 2018, she raised $6,100 for children’s education by riding a bicycle nearly 1,900 kilometers (about 1,180 miles) over a period of two weeks from Ayas, Turkey, to Agarak, a village on the Armenian-Iranian border.

Arianne Bo Caoili was born on Dec. 22, 1986, in Manila, the second daughter of a Dutch mother and a Filipino father who was a minister. In 1989 the family moved to Australia, where she learned to play chess at age 6.

She and Mr. Aronian first met in 1996 at the World Youth Chess Championship in Las Palmas, Spain; they married in 2017 in Armenia, where she had moved in 2013. Among the 300 guests at their wedding was Serzh Sargsyan, then the president of Armenia.

The graph shows that:

• in normal circumstances approx. less than half a person per day dies in Nembro (blue line)

• about in March 2020 up to 8 people per day were dying in Nembro (brown/orange line)

• out of these people who died, up to 2 per day tested positive for coronavirus (green line)

This would imply that the rest simply has not been tested (e.g. people dying at home and care homes).

It's just not possible that on top of coronavirus (confirmed two deaths per day), the town has experienced some other mysterious disease that's killing up to 6 more per day, which is going unnoticed.

I had a quick look online, and an Italian website confirms just that - coronavirus deaths in this town and all over Italy are being unreported due to shortage of resources. By a factor of 4 in Nembro and even up to 10 in Bergamo.

It goes on to say that the working assumption is that virtually everyone in Nembro has been infected and 1% died (population of 11,518 and 158 dead).

[The online article](https://www.blitzquotidiano.it/cronaca-italia/nembro-morti-coronavirus-quattro-3166656/amp/) 

Google Translate:

""What if there were many, but many more deaths in Italy attributable, directly or indirectly, to coronavirus?  The suspicion is that too many deaths of these painful weeks - lonely at home, in the homes for the elderly in the absence of hospitalizations or tests - have not been counted in the official health reports.  An empirical and distressing confirmation comes from the case of Nembro, a town in the Bergamo area that has been killed by the virus (the most affected in relation to the population).  31 official deaths from viruses, for an average death of 35: how do the total deaths be 158?  The number of deaths from covid seems four times lower than its real impact. Two physicists, the mayor and a health entrepreneur, statistically examined the case in relation to the dizzying increase in deaths these days compared to the corresponding period of last year.  .  The official deaths from Covid-19 to Nembro do not in any way justify the surge in deaths.

 158 total deaths, 31 from covid.  But the average death toll is 35

 ""We looked at the average of the deaths in the municipality of previous years, in the January-March period - write Claudio Cancelli and Luca Foresti in a letter to Corriere della Sera -.  According to it, Nembro should have had - under normal conditions - about 35 deaths.  158 people registered this year by the municipal offices. That is 123 more than the average.  Not 31 more.  The difference is enormous and cannot be a simple statistical deviation.  The number of abnormal deaths compared to the average is 4 times those officially attributed to Covid-19.  If you look at when these deaths occurred, the anomaly is even more evident: there is a spike in ""other"" deaths corresponding to that of the official deaths from Covid-19 "".

(...)

 The investigation model followed for Nembro has also been applied by the two physicists to two other municipalities, in support of the theory that the underestimation of the deaths attributable to the virus is valid in all the most affected territories.

 “We made exactly the same calculation for the municipalities of Cernusco sul Naviglio (Mi) and Pesaro.  In Cernusco the number of anomalous deaths is 6.1 times those officially attributed to Covid-19, also in Pesaro 6.1 times.  Bergamo's figures are impressive, where the ratio reaches 10.4 "".

 The study by the two physicists makes the hypothesis, far from remote, that all have been infected in Nembro: the mortality rate from covid-19, which is 1%, coincides with the total of 158 deaths.  And the rest of the municipality would have achieved flock immunity."""

China has blundered terribly in it's handling of many issues, that's for certain. But so has the US, as well as many other countries involved in the issues you listed above (where applicable).

To say that China's terrible handling of the initial coronavirus outbreak is the *only* reason it's progressed as far as it has is an extremely shallow interpretation, and neglects the failures in our own healthcare system, as well as the international community's rapid-response to a pandemic and preparedness.

Should they be reprimanded? Yes, of course. Not only for COVID-19, but also for many of the other issues you listed. But if we're to start holding states accountable for their failures, you'll find that China won't be the only one on that stage.

\--------------

Also, your language gives away the shallowness of your understanding of the CCP. I don't mean that to insult you, quite frankly China doesn't want to be understood by the West, and the West certainly isn't pushing for informing it's citizens of the CCP's motivations and structures. 

The CCP may be communist by name, but not truly in ideology. Also, as it's commonly perceived as a one-party state (also not really true), there is a misconception that the Chinese government is a clusterfuck of nepotism and bribery, and it's leaders are poorly elected and undeserving of their positions. It's actual internal structure is much more complicated than that, with democratic structures and elections, and testing systems for politicians (both for corruption and promotion) that many academics agree is more thorough than the US's. Is it corruption free? No way. But neither is *any* government.

Anyways, when you step away from looking at China from a soley American standpoint as a big scary we're gonna nuke democracy and make China the dictator of the world standpoint, you may realize that it, like many other governments, specifically the US's, fucks up, and (though I'm gonna regret boiling it down to this) is no better or no worse in the grand scheme of things.

Guantanamo? Agent Orange? AIDS crisis? Travel Ban? Our shitty healthcare system? Trump's separation and border policy?

Point is, the US is not a beacon of virtue and bringer of democracy and human rights, and China is not the demon it needs to slay."

**COVID-19 HEALTH ALERT**

Issued: April 3, 2020
By: Commissioner Adam Crum, Alaska Department of Health and Social Services 
Dr. Anne Zink, Chief Medical Officer, State of Alaska
Health Alert 010 – Recommendations Regarding the Use of Cloth Face Coverings
Scientific evidence available to date indicates that asymptomatic and presymptomatic shedding of the virus that causes COVID-19 is occurring.  This means that people who have no symptoms whatsoever may be infected with the virus and capable of transmitting the virus to others when interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing.  This heightens the need for community-wide implementation of control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among people who are not experiencing symptoms of illness.  
The primary ways to do this are through social distancing, frequent hand-washing, and disinfecting high-touch surfaces. Another tool that may help to minimize transmission while people are around others outside of their household is the use of face coverings. Because we are experiencing a nationwide shortage of medical supplies, including facemasks, we recommend that Alaskans make their own face coverings and wear them in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) -- especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.  This recommendation aligns with current national guidance: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html 
The following measures are highly recommended for all Alaskans:

Wear a cloth face covering in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies). 

Make sure the face covering covers both the nose and mouth.

Do not remove the face covering until you return home. 

When removing the face covering, avoid touching the front of the face covering (because it may be contaminated). Remove it by grasping the ear loops, ties, or bands and immediately discard or place in a designated container for laundering.  

Wash your hands immediately after removing the face covering and before touching anything else.

Wash face coverings in hot, soapy water between uses.

Do not wear N-95 or surgical masks; these are needed by health care workers and first responders.

Do not rely on face coverings as the primary way to prevent COVID-19 transmission, and be careful to avoid developing a false sense of security through the use of face coverings. Continue to follow social distancing measures, including maintaining at least six feet between yourself and others, staying at home, avoiding touching your face, and washing your hands frequently.

What is a cloth face covering? A cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.
How do I make a homemade face coverings? Cloth face coverings can be fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost. There are a number of instructional websites and videos that people can refer to for making face coverings; two such videos are available at https://youtu.be/VgHrnS6n4iA and https://youtu.be/1r2C1zGUHbU 
How well do cloth face coverings work to prevent spread of COVID-19? There is limited evidence available on how well cloth face coverings help reduce COVID-19 transmission. Their primary role is to reduce the release of respiratory droplets into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes, including people who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms. Cloth face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing and washing hands and staying home when ill, but they may be helpful when combined with these primary interventions.
How should I care for a cloth face covering? Wash your cloth face covering frequently, ideally after each use, or at least daily. Have a bag or bin to keep cloth face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your cloth face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard cloth face coverings that:

No longer cover the nose and mouth 

Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps

Cannot stay on the face

Have holes or tears in the fabric
