(led HK's efforts vs H1N1 in 2009)

> ""Wuhan is extensively connected to the North, South, East and West of China. The number of cases exported from Wuhan to the rest of mainland China, in our [epidemiological] model as of Jan25, range from 18 in Qingdao to a high of 318 in Chongqing. The numbers will be higher by now. But that's not the most important point. There have been quarantines since Jan23 [referring to the Hubei Quarantine]. We ran the model with and without the quarantines accounted for, and the forecasts are very similar. The quarantines may not be able to substantially change the course of the epidemic curves in other major Chinese city clusters.

> [We modeled epidemic curves out to August 2020 for all the major city clusters in China: Chongqing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing.](https://www.med.hku.hk/f/news/3549/7418/Wuhan-coronavirus-outbreak_AN-UPDATE_20200127.pdf) Chongqing is predicted to have the largest epidemic due to its large population and  intense traffic volume coupled to Wuhan. The timing of the peak is sometime in April to May 2020, one to two weeks in Chonqing before the other major city clusters (except Wuhan which will peak even earlier).

The modeled daily incidence peaks at over 150,000 for Chongqing in late April and over 50,000 in early May for Beijing and Shanghai, this is not the total number of people who will get sick but rather how many people are sick on the worst day of the epidemic before things start returning to normal."

APA’s lawsuit notes that American Airlines currently operates approximately 56 monthly flights between Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and airports in China. The airline has announced a suspension of flights between Los Angeles International Airport and China but not until Feb. 9. Each American Airlines crewmember working a trip to China is required to be on the ground for approximately 32 hours between flights to comply with federal rest regulations. In its filing, APA cites warnings issued by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health organizations discouraging all “nonessential travel” to China.

“The safety and well-being of our crews and passengers must always be our highest priority — first, last, and always,” said APA President Capt. Eric Ferguson. “Numerous other major carriers that serve China, including British Airways, Air Canada, and Lufthansa, have chosen to suspend service to that country out of an abundance of caution. The APA leadership has asked American Airlines management to follow suit, but to date they have not canceled any U.S.-China flights. We are therefore compelled to seek injunctive relief.

“We estimate that as many as 300 passengers and crew travel to DFW alone from Chinese cities on each American Airlines flight,” he said. “To us, that level of risk is unacceptable."

Two reasons:

1) Wuhan is ground zero and the virus has been there weeks before anywhere else. Deaths take time.

2) The law of viral outbreaks. People with mild cases continue about their lives, move between cities and countries etc, infecting people with their milder, less serious coronavirus strains. People with severe cases stop their lives, go home or to a hospital and contact fewer people. 

We may end up with a situation where coronavirus spreads across the globe, but overhwelmingly as a less severe strain with a low mortality trate.

Also:

> Either CCP is exaggerating numbers for some reason

Day after day on here 'maybe China are covering up the number of deaths'...sigh. They are reporting a significant number. You can ascribe whatever motive or modifier to that number as you please, but they are clearly not pretending this isnt a serious outbreak. Hundreds of dead announced and rising, thats not a very good cover up statement. Maybe, just maybe... the number is actually their best estimate/as time goes by, the estimate gets better.

We've literally reached Schroedinger's China n-Cov. The government are either exaggerating or minimising the number of deaths, depending on which Redditor's think is the government's conspiracy of the day."

The situation is horrible. There is only one clinic that can handle infections diseases like coronavirus. They only have a few hundred beds and that's it, and even those beds are mostly occupied by existing patients (late stages of AIDS etc). There is simply no way to they can contain the virus on their own. The hospital where my brother works is regular hospital, they don't even have hazmat suits and testing kits. Number of masks is limited. Number of beds is also limited.

I am afraid that once this virus comes to my country, people will behave like they behaved during the Black Death - blocking the roads with logs, witchhunting potential carriers, assaulting hospital staff for not having test kits etc.

 the coronavirus can also be passed on through touch. The incubation period is typically 3-7 days and 14 at most. Most people who get it are fine, and children are especially lightly affected.

The death rate from [official statistics](https://voice.baidu.com/act/newpneumonia/newpneumonia) is currently 2%.

At least how I see it."

https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3048295/men-may-be-more-prone-coronavirus-women-chinese-study-finds

In a study published Wednesday in the Lancet the mortality rate of the 99 cases was 11 per cent. That compares to an earlier study by doctors from the same hospital and other Chinese scientists based on 41 patients, which put the mortality rate at 15 per cent.

The researchers based the study on 99 patients – 67 men and 32 women – admitted to the Wuhan hospital from January 1 to 20.

One-third of the patients in the study developed complications and organ failure. Some 17 per cent developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, a serious lung condition, while 8 per cent experienced an acute lung injury and 3 per cent had kidney failure or damage.

The finding was in line with earlier observations that men with underlying health problems were more prone to the virus, but the latest study was based on a bigger sample size.

So probability of mortality by group

deaths <40 0%  vs  >40 100%

men 67% vs women 33%

Men and women over 40 = 22%

men over 40 = 32.8%

women over 40 = 7.26%"

The sale of McDonald's restaurant chain, which provided for the sale of bigmack and other dishes at a price of 1990, is canceled, a fast food chain representative told RBC.

As explained in the company, this is due to measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in Moscow. On the eve of the government of the capital recommended to abstain from public events in crowded places in the near future in order to minimize the risks of the spread of infection.

The action, timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the company in Russia, was to take place on Friday, January 31, at the first McDonald's institution, opened in Moscow in 1990 at the address: ul. Bolshaya Bronnaya, 29.

As it follows from the document published on the company's website with the rules of the action (. Pdf ), hamburgers, cheeseburgers and chikenburgers for the period of its holding would cost 3 rubles, and for 30 rubles. one could buy standard french fries and a number of other goods - a cherry pie, two Happy Mil toys, soft drinks, tea or cappuccino (from 0.2 to 0.25 liters).

According to the CEO of the network, Mark Karen, the company is sympathetic to the actions of the Moscow authorities and share concerns about the spread of infection. He promised that McDonald's would find another time and way to celebrate “30 Years of Our Friendship.”

The outbreak of the new type of coronavirus 2019-nCoV was first recorded in China in late December. According to the WHO, 6065 people are infected (5997 of them in China). Chinese authorities claim 7,711 confirmed cases of the disease in the country. The virus has spread to all regions of China and beyond. Certain cases of the disease were recorded in the USA, Canada, France, Finland, Australia, Japan, South Africa and other countries.

There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus 2019-nCoV in Russia. In order to reduce the risks of the spread of infection in the country, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin ordered the borders to be closed in five regions of the Far Eastern District, and the country's Foreign Ministry temporarily suspended the processing of electronic visas for Chinese citizens."

They don't have many cases of Coronavirus yet but there has been one fatality. She is in her 60s already and has pre-existing health conditions so she's definitely in that 'at risk' group. 

She told us that the doctors in her ward are rotating to do the 'fever clinics'. (Sorry, I don't know what the proper term is for this, but I guess it's like the walk-in clinic but for patients with fever symptoms). The head of her department isn't letting people who are in her age group do it, she wants to volunteer, but the family told her to listen to her department head. My uncle (retired) has to drive her to work each day because taxis apparently refuse to carry passengers to the hospital.

I think it's pretty cool that doctors regardless of age are willing to risk their own health to serve patients who they don't know while the rest of the public do all they can to avoid the sick.  As the number of confirmed cases increases, so does the risk to all the health professionals treating the ill - both in China and across the world."

Ebola is bad but it is so lethal that it is hard for it to spread except in countries with terrible infrastructure and poverty. Ebola use to be even more lethal and annihilate whole villages before it could spread to others. Ebola epidemics are lasting longer now because it has evolved to be slightly less lethal to us.

This new coronavirus is the real threat. The CDC has not verified reports of asymptomatic transmission so there might be a little hope. I also want to know the number of people who get cold like symptoms and go on to infect others. The seriously ill get quarantined in hospitals but people with a mild cold go on with their lives.

We will really not know if it is contained for a few more weeks. I cannot imagine that China can keep up that level of quarantine much longer. They probably should not either especially if it is too late to stop. 

What’s interesting about bats is they have high levels of interferon A and a suppressed inflammatory response to infection. This helps the bats survive because inflammation, like pneumonia, would mean they cannot fly and feed. Other mammals do not have a hyperactive immune system. When they do it is usually an autoimmune disorder. Instead of overzealous white blood cells we have an inflammatory response.

Bat viruses are well adapted to a bat’s high levels of interferon A and low levels of immune inflammatory response. There are approved drugs that can boost interferon A and suppress the inflammatory response in people. I want to know if a drug cocktail that mimics a bats immune system is more effective at fighting this virus. Unsurprisingly, patients with underlying health issues (probably low levels of interferon A and too few white blood cells) are more likely to die of the inflammation of cells in the lungs, the pneumonia, as the virus spreads to the lungs after several weeks of infection. Stopping the virus before it can colonize the lungs weeks after the initial infection would likely save lives and lower the rate of transmission. Anyway that is my hypothesis until we turn into zombies."

> Landon agrees that we don’t yet know how the coronavirus transmits, but believes the results of this study are applicable. All previous coronaviruses have transmitted through droplets, she notes, so it would be unusual if this new pathogen was different. And indeed, the new coronavirus is behaving much like SARS in many respects. Both are zoonotic, meaning they started in animals before jumping to humans, and both appear to have started in bats. The pair also transmit from human to human and have a long incubation period—up to 14 days for the Wuhan coronavirus, compared to about two for influenza—which means that people might be sick and transmitting the disease before symptoms show up.

> With all that in mind, Landon suggests following the CDC guidance for infectious diseases when you’re on an airplane.

> That includes washing your hands with regular soap or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after touching any surface—especially since there’s evidence that coronaviruses last longer on surfaces than other illnesses, around three to 12 hours.

HSF: 1/3 of the partnership are confirmed lizard people. 

Allens: Also lizard people but some are also half human, half fly. Partnership meetings are really weird because like some of the lizards are trying to eat some of the flies. And so their partnership deed effectively has to be really flexible.

Clayton Utz: Secretly planning to merge with HSF and Allens once the fly-people gain ascendancy. I understand that a condition precedent to the merger is a royal commission into the bush fires. Unconfirmed reports indicate that CU partners were starting fires in Bermagui. 

KWM: Attempting to stop the merger by any means. Unconfirmed sources indicate that the novel coronavirus was smuggled into the country by KWM partners returning from Wuhan.

Ashurst: The top tier label seems a little contrived when you apply it to them and like no one really cares what they do and they seem to even underpay their own employees despite being a supposed top tier law firm?

Minters: Same as Ashurst, without the confirmed wage-theft. Anonymous sources indicate that there are plans to co-partner with McDonald's to launch a new McMinters Burger. You'll be able to buy the McMinters whenever you visit one of their offices (soon to have Maccas outlets). Just like their legal advice, the quality is questionable but the McMinters is relatively cheap for a global brand and you can get it almost anywhere. 

HWLE: Juan is secretly Elon Musk and they've collaborated with the lizard and fly-people and are able to shape shift. Unconfirmed reports also indicate that the HWLE partnership application process involves Juan sitting on your face and twisting your nipples gently."

>The investigators found that approximately 245,000 deaths in the United States in the year 2000 were attributable to low levels of education, 176,000 to racial segregation, 162,000 to low social support, 133,000 to individual-level poverty, 119,000 to income inequality, and 39,000 to area-level poverty. Overall, 4.5% of U.S. deaths were found to be attributable to poverty—midway between previous estimates of 6% and 2.3%. However the risks associated with both poverty and low education were higher for individuals aged 25 to 64 than for those 65 or older.

There is a NEED for concern. Not only has WHO declared this as a global health emergency, its is also wayyyyy more deadly and infectious than SARs (which alot of people are comparing it to). SARs couldn’t transmit between people before symptoms show and coronavirus has already infected more people than SARs ever did. And dont bring up that it has a 2% mortality rate cuz that number is bs, it only looks at the current ratio between infected people and dead people. The real value that people are looking for is the survivability chance, which is estimated to be 65% chance (of living). Lets add on top of these facts that viruses mutate like crazy (hence why it was able to spread to humans from animals), which means once its out there it has a good chance of becoming deadlier the more it infects. Also YOU CANNOT CURE viruses, you can only vaccinate against them. I could carry on, however here is some good news:

Good news!
1) Australia has replicated the coronavirus and is developing a way to detect infected individuals before they show symptoms. 
2) Many countries are working super hard to quarantine,

> Receptors for coronavirus are deep in a person’s lungs – **a person must inhale enough of the virus that it can actually bind to those receptors deep in the lungs**.

> **Coronavirus is transmitted via larger droplets that fall quickly out of the air (for example, after a sneeze). This virus is not airborne**.

> Coronavirus is **not something that people can get from casual contact. A person must be in close contact (within 2 metres) with somebody** to be able to inhale those droplets if a person coughs or sneezes without cover, in front of them.

> **The droplets can fall to the ground after a sneeze and a person can touch them with their hands. The risk of transmission is low in this case**, as those droplets must be of significant enough quantity to make it to the receptors in a person’s lungs.

> If a person has touched something that has droplets on it with coronavirus in it, **as long as they clean their hands before touching their face or your mouth, they are not at risk of getting that virus in their body**.

> **Coronavirus is not something that comes in through the skin**. This virus is remitted through large droplets that are breathed deep into a person’s lungs.

> Regarding wearing masks – **masks should be used by sick people to prevent transmission to other people. A mask will help keep a person’s droplets in**.

> It may be less effective to wear a mask in the community when a person is not sick themselves. Masks may give a person a false sense of security & are likely to increase the number of times a person will touch their own face – to adjust the mask, etc.

> **The most important thing that a person can do to prevent themselves from getting #coronavirus is to wash their hands regularly and avoid touching their face**.

> Cover your mouth when you cough so you're not exposing other people. If you are sick yourself, stay away from others. Contact your health care provider ahead of time so you can be safely assessed."

On the 22nd of January, Hubei reported  69 new cases and 8 deaths. 

I point this out since it suggests that there should be higher mortality figures coming from outside Hubei.

I don't pin this on any one cause though, rather I think its a combination of:

- Hubei being initially overwhelmed and the panic around the infection having resulted in higher mortalities.

- Other provinces having had more time to prepare.

- Other provinces being earlier along in disease progression.

- An under reporting of mortalities in China but outside Hubei due to political reasons."

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an exopeptidase that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to the nonapeptide angiotensin[1-9], or the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. ACE2 has direct effects on cardiac function,a and is expressed predominantly in vascular endothelial cells of the heart and the kidneys.ACE2 receptors have been shown to be the entry point into human cells for some coronaviruses, including the SARS virus, and the Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

All the while it is people that are similar to antivaxers that propagate fear. They think they know everything yet they don’t understand science.

On another note, in the very beginning, when only china was infected and they were speculating on how it spreads.

The general idea was that it spread trough some sort of animal contact, mainly from eating food from those wet markets.

Some even speculated a bat infected a snake and then someone eat a snake and got sick.

But soon after that people were talking about people not being anywhere near the wet market, or using such food (there are plenty of ""proper"" grocery shops and super markets around).

Eventually other countries starter reporting infected people, and then others started to show up who were ""nearby"" the area of the reported infected person- confirming the virus spreads from human to human."

So far we have been lucky. No cases reported here. However, that can change at any minute... So I wandered over at r/coronavirus and got kinda scared. And now I'm here. 

I'll be looking through the posts and files here to see what I can use.

I work at a place that sells among other things PPE equipment and masks and have seen an influx of people pricing and buying everything from alcohol to wipes to masks to respirators and tychem coveralls  and the like. 

It's crazy. Too bad I waited this long since we are no longer allowed to buy stuff 


The main question I have before  I start my research is :  if I have money on the bank, should I retire some /most of it to have cash if needed? I'm guessing banks are going to be useless if this thing blows up.

For the time being, the wife and I agree will start shipping for additional water and non perishable stuff that we can stash just in case, and if not used for the emergency, we can still use anyway.

As they say, the first step is the hardest to do eh?

2020-01-30,Virgil_F,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewhhhr/harvard_university_professor_arrested_for/fg2fkpp/,"My theory is that a world renown chinese biology researcher had the idea to research bats in wuhan and how they are able to be infected with tons of viruses but never show any symptoms.

How it ties with america and canada and things that happened before this point i don't know.

Then at one point, somehow ,some infected bats escaped ,went into the wild, infected other things like snakes and somehow got in contact with the wuhan people.

[source](https://www.zerohedge.com/health/man-behind-global-coronavirus-pandemic) that i base my theory on.

TLDR:

1. One of China's top virology and immunology experts was and still **works at China's top-rated biohazard lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which some have affectionately called** [**the real Umbrella Corp**](https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/real-umbrella-corp-wuhan-ultra-biohazard-lab-was-studying-worlds-most-dangerous-pathogens)**.**
2. Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world.
3. His primary field of study is researching **how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick.**
4. He was genetically engineering various immune pathways ([such as the STING pathway in bats](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323347216_Dampened_STING-Dependent_Interferon_Activation_in_Bats)) to make the bats more or less susceptible to infection, **in the process potentially creating a highly resistant mutant superbug.**
5. As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; **these are ""superbug"" Coronavirus strains, which are not resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild.**
6. As of mid-November, his lab was actively hiring inexperienced post-docs to help conduct his research into super-Coronaviruses and bat infections.
7. Peng's work on virology and bat immunology **has received support from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology.**

Edit: At this point its just a theory that seems interesting, and has some nice documentation and ""timing"" that kinda fits with the theory.   
To be honest i don't think there is time to witch hunt right now and people should focus on other things"

Although cold viruses have been shown to survive on surfaces for several days, their ability to cause an infection reduces rapidly and they don't often survive longer than 24 hours.

Common cold virus (which is also a coronavirus) can last “a couple hours to maybe a couple days,” depending on temperature, humidity, and other factors. The viruses can sometimes survive on indoor surfaces for more than 7 days. In general, viruses survive for longer on non-porous (water resistant) surfaces, such as stainless steel and plastics, than porous surfaces, such as fabrics and tissues.

Packets and goods from China usually take several weeks to arrive, so even if infected person was handling it and some viruses ended up on the surface, chances of the virus surviving is extremely small, practically zero."

Both Presidents [took their oath on January 20th as per the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.](https://www.history.com/news/why-does-inauguration-day-fall-on-january-20)

The first three links have their data in tables. Each successive day is a day of trading, so it's easy for a computer to count the number of rows to determine the number of days of trading.

The math is elementary school stuff. Dividing the closing number for any day's trading by the closing number on the day of inauguration gives a number. If a market was at 10,000 at the start and on a particular day it was at 12,309, that's 12309 / 10000 which is 1.2309. That's 123.09%, or a 23.09% increase. Computers are pretty good at this type of thing.

Then it's plotted on a graph using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML version 5 in this case) and JavaScript (JS), which [computers are also good at and templates are readily available to work with](https://www.chartjs.org/). 

Lots of sites [use the numbers to make interactive charts for any traded commodity.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/chart?p=AAPL) Anyone can choose a period, look at the historical data, look at news articles from those days that explains why the markets acted like they did (the coronavirus in China seems to be affecting markets today, for example). 

#And there's the beauty of it. It's numbers. Cold. Hard. Numbers. It's as solid a fact as the Sun and the Moon and the Stars.

The numbers don't give a shit what color tie or lapel pin your favorite presidents put on. Numbers don't give a fuck about people's feelings. Anyone claiming this is ""fake news"" is so incredibly butt-hurt the only thing you could do that's not a complete waste of time is mock them for getting butt-hurt about numbers, because they've tipped their hand on how they truly feel about the world.

As far as numbers go: statistics from stock markets is one of the most readily available, well documented, easiest things to find online. Constantly updating. Stored in multiple places. They're fucking weak if that triggers them, as is their philosophy, and everyone knows it."

>“In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for Disease Control’s Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Monday morning press briefing.

					 				

>Even in the worse case scenario — say, a sneezing person packaged your $700 used Apple iPhone 11, bought on Amazon and shipped to your home by air via United Parcel Service or FedEx — isn’t dangerous.
To be sure, there isn’t research about the specific resiliency of this virus, because it is so new. But studies show that its cousin viruses, SARS and MERS, only live for few hours on the surface of an object. They are spread most often by respiratory droplets from one person to another.
It typically takes at least three days for a package to get from China to California, according to UPS and FedEx.  So the virus wouldn’t be able to survive long enough to get you sick.

Medical tests aren’t crystal balls—there’s false positives and negatives—so the test alone doesn’t tell you much if you don’t already have a certain threshold level of suspicion. 

There’s a reason we don’t just start testing everyone for coronavirus (and it’s not just expense). Even if the test had 5% false positive rate (which is really good and on par with the rapid influenza test) all it takes is to test 100 random people sick with upper respiratory infections (say in Kansas or somewhere without likely exposure to coronavirus) and we already have 5 false positives! Odds are those people have the flu or some other more common respiratory infection from their community. Now on the other hand, if we had a positive test for someone who is in Wuhan or who was within the past two week who also has symptoms of a respiratory infection? Odds are that person has the virus because our pretest suspicion was already much higher. Germany has 4 confirmed coronavirus cases right now. It’s a lot more like Kansas than Wuhan when it comes to pretest suspicion.

I think the statistics behind all this are really interesting. The statistical values are called sensitivity and specificity and you can look them up for any medical test. It’s the reason we don’t do colonoscopies on everyone. This Wikipedia page does a pretty good job of explaining the basics. 

[Sensitivity and specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) 

Also, this specific test isn’t currently something you can just send to the lab at the hospital. I don’t know about Germany but in the US to test for coronavirus you have to mail samples to the CDC and wait for days. They’re literally the only ones in the whole country that can run the test for now. You’re not going to do that for everyone unless they have confirmed contact with someone from Wuhan."

First, 2019-nCoV is likely spread by respiratory droplets, not by air. Although the transmission pathway hasn't been confirmed yet, both other pandemic coronaviruses, SARS and MERS-CoV, were not airborne, rather they were transmitted by droplet spread. 

Second, out of an abundance of caution, 2019-nCoV cases are recommended to be under airborne precautions but the disease is more likely to be transmitted by respiratory droplets. Therefore, the overcautious quarantine procedures may be contributing to limiting spread in some places since they're higher standards than just respiratory droplet precautions. But, keep in mind that this outbreak recently surpassed both SARS and MERS-CoV in transmission and it shows no signs of slowing down. This amount of spread should be concerning and is likely tied to the lower mortality rate of the novel coronavirus. People are not as sick and can travel and infect others more readily."

Mathematically if the majority of the population gets infected let's say 50% is 3.7 billion.  Then at a lethality rate of 2% 74,000,000 will die.  To put into perspective, the US would have roughly 3,272,000 die. 

50 isn't ""old"" but there are 108,000,000 people over 50 in the US.  The normal flu has a lethality rate of 1 in every 1000. Coronavirus currently has a lethality rate of 1 in 50.  

Here's the thing, unless the Coronavirus infects like the swine flu did, it's not going to be that big of a deal.  If it does infect at the same rate swine flu did, it'll be a very big deal, but still half of the entire globes population is so improbable.  Swine flu and Spanish flu were insanely infections and it never went over 33% of the population.  

Don't be worried yet, just but some masks and gloves and don't get too close to strangers in highly populated areas.  You'll be fine!"

People with exactly that attitude have been spreading the virus around. They are doing it because they themselves are not the old and the weak.

The one we are presented with today. If proper isolation/quarantine procedures were not followed, who knows where the specific orientation of this virus is. 


Will be tough to ever factually prove. 'Patient 0', may have been initially infected months ago, allowing the virus to adapt to the current contagion level we see today. It likely did not develop its capability to infect humans, within the bats. Rather 'patient 0' ""bred"" this virus into what we see today. 

This is why rapid, detailed medical analysis should always take place. Dont discredit any upper respiratory illness, even if minor/long term, as a common cold/flu. 

If you contract a 'cold', and you commonly handle exotic animals (near their breeding/living quarters), most breeding facilities MANDATE URGENT medical analysis for novel disease development."

Viruses, etc. mutate, that's what they do. It's not any more of a threat than any other respiratory illness that goes untreated. 

If you look at the CDC website, the critical criteria to determine if there is even the potential for someone to have the coronavirus, they would have to have the symptoms of a lower respiratory infection and a fever...and also have to have been to Wuhan City, China or been in contact with someone in the last 14 days that has been to Wuhan City. 

To my understanding, all of the cases currently being tested in the US are people who were literally in Wuhan City. Several of them tested negative for it after the fact, too. It's cold & flu season, so naturally people are being extra cautious.

You do you, but again, this isn't anything to have a concern over. Jesus, even the damn H1N1 scare back in 2008 or 2009 was substantially worse than this."

They use something called the R0 to kind of classify how easy it is for an infection to spread and the higher the R0 is, the more easily spread it can be.  

With that in mind, these are the R0s for seasonal influenza and the suspected Wuhan coronavirus:

Seasonal flu: 1.3

2019-nCoV:  est. 2.1

Influenza A (H1N1): 1.4-1.6  


So, the 2019-nCoV is, on the surface, twice as infectious as the seasonal flu and unlike the seasonal flu, it doesn't have an available vaccine yet.  It's also likely more infectious than H1N1. It's already outstripped the number of SARS infections.  In fact, the R0 of 2019-nCoV makes the increase in the number of infections exponential which is why the graphs of confirmed infections has that dramatic upswing like it does (see the graphs that are lovingly posted every day to see what that looks like compared to SARS and H1N1).  

Then, there is the issue of mortality rate.  They don't have that calculated yet in any definitive sense as the virus is still at the beginning and that kind of figure is calculated afterwards.  However, they do know that in prior coronavirus infections (SARS and MERS), the mortality rates were **much higher** than seasonal flu and H1N1.  This one seems to be less fatal than SARS but still, a very infectious coronavirus is not a good thing.

There is a NEED for concern. Not only has WHO declared this as a global health emergency, its is also wayyyyy more deadly and infectious than SARs (which alot of people are comparing it to). SARs couldn’t transmit between people before symptoms show and coronavirus has already infected more people than SARs ever did. And dont bring up that it has a 2% mortality rate cuz that number is bs, it only looks at the current ratio between infected people and dead people. The real value that people are looking for is the survivability chance, which is estimated to be 65% chance (of living). Lets add on top of these facts that viruses mutate like crazy (hence why it was able to spread to humans from animals), which means once its out there it has a good chance of becoming deadlier the more it infects. Also YOU CANNOT CURE viruses, you can only vaccinate against them. I could carry on, however here is some good news:

Furthermore, coronavirus is much harder to detect, due to it taking up to two weeks to show symptoms. Also there's a chance that the coronavirus could mutate with the flu, should it find itself in the body of someone with both, since they are fairly similar in nature. That would make the coronavirus much worse. 

Whether the coronavirus will kill more people, that remains to be seen, but in truth SARS has a higher mortality percentage than coronavirus."

**Cases**

[As of Jan 30, 2020 11am EST](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) we have total 8235 confirmed cases:

* 171 deaths
* 143 recovered
* 7921 unresolved 

From this we can calculate, that *out of the resolved cases*:

    (171 deaths) / (314 total resolved) = 54% died and 46% recovered

We have to keep in mind that it takes longer for person to recover than to die from the illness, so the above calculation isn't a good representation of the actual chances of dying of this flu. In addition, the reported numbers only include those who have been tested positive for the virus. A lot of the actual infections will go undiagnosed because Chinese hospitals don't have enough test kits to test everyone. Finally, majority of people with symptoms will choose to stay at home instead of going to the overcrowded hospitals where infected are gathered and spreading the virus around. Many people will recover at home, and some will also die at home.

There's also the very likely possibility that China's officials are reporting much lower numbers (of both infected and dead) for various politial and economic reasons.

**World Health Organization**

The only number given out by World Health Organization (WHO) so far has been a case fatality rate (CFR), which is the number of deaths divided by total confirmed cases. 

    (171 deaths) / (8235 confirmed cases) = 2% case fatality rate

While this is the correct way to calculate case fatality rate, this number doesn't give accurate estimation of the actual mortality rate of the flu, because it is an ongoing situation where majority of the confirmed cases are still unresolved. We don't have the information of whether the unresolved cases end up recovering or dying.

WHO themselves mentioned in the same [press conference](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings#): ""*The only number currently known is how many people have died out of those who have been reported to the WHO...it is therefore very early to make any conclusive statements about what the overall mortality rate will be*"".

**The Lancet Study** 

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext

A study published in The Lancet tracked 99 confirmed cases from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Death rate in that study was **11%**. While it's true that this study has small sample size and only includes hospitalized cases, it is most likely the closest we have of the actual mortality rate of this virus.



**Comparison**

For comparison, the case fatality rate of similar viruses: 

* SARS (**11%**)
* MERS (**35%**)

Seasonal flu is less than 0.01%."

I'm thinking is the stock will slowly meander up and down until battery investor day. If the Wuhan Coronavirus is really bad, it will probably be meandering more downward. Bad macro will attract more irrational shorts to pile on, causing downward swings in macro to have disproportionately larger swings in TSLA.

I think Musk is holding off on saying FSD is feature complete until 2020Q1 in order to boost profitability in the historically weak Q1. I think he said on the 2019 Q4 earnings call that its a few months out. This will help shore up the balance sheet in the weak quarter to allow for 4 quarters of profitability to allow inclusion into the S&P 500.

Battery investor day, Q1 profitability and soon thereafter inclusion in the S&P 500 will be a 1, 2 punch to start the stock on its next epic climb. If Wuhan Coronavirus is really bad, it will make the Q1 numbers possibly not great which will moderate the mania that the numbers coming out of battery day will precipitate.

Battery day will reveal some numbers that the shorts will claim ""are lies"" due to their revelation of just how far ahead Tesla really is."

Not sure how you define casual interaction, but there were 2 cases:

1. Japanese tour bus driver who drove 2 groups of tourists from Wuhan got infected.

2. German guy went for same training session with someone from Wuhan who got infected.

Thus far it seems like it spreads when there is prolonged exposure, although 2 is really too small of a number to make any conclusions."

What about China track record with SARS? While yes all that stuff you cited happened, a majority of it happened in the last 1 to 2 weeks. Covering up damaging situation to a communist party image is a standard SOP in a communist playbook. 

It's very hard to know what the difference is between actual numbers and Chinas numbers. The best we can do is hope the discrepancy is small. I hope it doesn't spread anywhere else but with stories like a Japanese bus driver, it seems that probability is low. If it does spread, we could potentially compare those data sets to what China official numbers.

eg: 61,000 flu deaths in the United States 2017-2018, that translates to 5,490,000 potential deaths to coronavirus per year in the United States.

2020-01-30,100feettall,AskReddit,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ew5dbe/is_this_ocd/ffztk80/," i'm 17, and i think i'm suffering from OCD, but i don't really know much about it so i'm asking reddit. 

 it started when i was like 6. my mum had to go outside to throw out the garbage and i got really anxious and called her 6 times in 2 mins until she picked up. and i couldn't stay in my room for more than 10 mins till i was 12 because of my big window right beside my desk. i always got the feeling that someone is staring at me through the window and i just couldn't stand it. 

 last year, i think i was stressing out bc of school, grades etc i kept on reminding myself that i had to be successful in life and so i have to ace all the exams. i studied after school for 5-6 hours a day and 11-12 hours on the weekends. i go to this room thing where people study in blocked rooms with a chair and a desk in it it's really small and cramped and you can't make a sound. anyway that's when my thoughts went crazy. violent thoughts like stabbing my mum and my closest friend with a knife, tearing someone's body in pieces, pushing someone into the road etc consistently popped inside my head and it just wouldn't stop so i had to yell(in my head) to stop the thoughts.

 and Wuhan coronavirus went viral and first saw the news 4 days ago. this time i couldn't stop thinking about the virus spreading all over the world and the chaos it would make. i stayed up till 4am googling about the virus and how to protect myself from it.

 the constant fear of death also haunts me occasionally. like i won't be able to sleep after getting in bed 2 hrs ago bc of the thoughts of me dying, the things that would happen after that and how my parents would react etc.. 

 and i hate wasting time on doing something else than studying i check the time when im just googling stuff and watching yt so i can use my time to do 'better' things and when i lose the track of time resting(on my phone, doing things i like except studying), i feel extremely guilty and the intensity of the hatred toward myself is more than you could imagine. 

 i have no one to talk to about this matter, i feel like it's a taboo to tell someone i have some kind of a mental disorder so i have kept this to myself for a long time.  i'll appreciate if you leave a comment to help me out."

You might be right, but whatever data you are basing your assessment on I can almost guarantee is invalid.

I find it outrageous that media parrot the ""death toll"" released by China given what we know of the [testing protocol](https://www.thailandmedical.news/news/reasons-for-china’s-unreliable-death-and-infected-statistics--finally-revealed-insufficient-test-kits,-also-cambodia-reports-first-case):

>Wuhan city alone had only received 6,000 such test kits since the 22 of January and were told that another 30,000 test kits would arrive but these have yet to materialize. Doctors were then ordered to only administer the test to those who were only showing severe conditions of the disease. Also in cases of deaths that occurred, if a test was not done prior to the patient dying to confirm that they had the virus, they were officially asked to list the cause of death as due to other reasons such as organ failure, kidney failure or cardiac failure etc. In addition for those that were exhibiting symptoms but had no test yet, they were to be classed as being under observations according to the officials who wanted to remain anonymous out of fear. The same protocols had been adhered to all over China apparently, hence accounting for low death rates and infected rates due to the coronavirus.

There is another report by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-testing-insight-idUSKBN1ZQ21K) which says staff have been ordered not to use tests on people unlikely to recover. Which makes sense if using tests to maximize patient care is the goal, but which makes the data totally useful for tracking overall fatalities.

Notice also that what you and I would call ""suspected,"" are being counted as ""under observation"".

There have been strong smells coming out of official reports right from the beginning, starting from early Jan, you know, when they were arresting those 8 people for speaking publicly on the subject. 

As I said in an earlier comment, if you have specific examples where media exaggerated the threat, backed by some reliable data, lets hear it."

In my opinion it’s stupid to:
1. Express blatant racism towards all Chinese individuals (stemming from your very own ignorance) 

2. Let the coronavirus be a reason you stop living your life. We still go grocery shopping. We still go out for a light walk. We still enjoy family life at home. Just because we live in China doesn’t mean we don’t deserve to enjoy our own life and live like it’s a zombie apocalypse

3. Panic when there isn’t even a single confirmed case in your own city. This isn’t some superpower virus that can jump from person to person just because you share the same space. As long as you take the proper precautions, the chances are very low. Most especially if you live in a city miles from a single confirmed case, like middle of Kansas. 

Even during a zombie apocalypse, it’s probably best to be worried and cautionary but not absolutely panicked blind"

Chinese authorities are cracking down on negative media coverage and social media commentary about the coronavirus outbreak, threatening anyone who breaches their rules with up to seven years in jail.

On Wednesday the government authorities issued an order for an article that looked at the possible negative impact of the outbreak on China’s economy to be scrubbed from the internet.

The article, published by state-owned weekly news magazine Sanlian Life Week, considered what might happen to the Chinese economy if the Word Health Organization declares the Wuhan coronavirus to be a “global health emergency.”
The alert, leaked to California-based monitoring group China Digital Times, is just the latest effort by Beijing to censor criticism of the outbreak.

Beijing is eager to avoid a repeat of what happened during its 2003 SARS crisis, when it was heavily criticized for its delayed reaction to the outbreak and its effort to hide its true scale.
Globally, its efforts seem to be working.

On Wednesday, the World Health Organization was effusive in its praise of the Chinese government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, but inside the country, the government is working overtime to make sure any shortcomings in its response don’t come to light.

These efforts include arresting dozens of social media users who spread “false information without verification.” One of those arrested turned out to be a doctor on the front line of the fights to contain the virus, who shared information about the unknown illness with a private WeChat group. The doctor, who was forced to sign a document saying he would abide by the law, has since been infected with the coronavirus and remains in a critical condition.

READ: Scientists have already developed a coronavirus vaccine
This week, police in the port city of Tianjin detained a man for 10 days for “maliciously publishing aggressive, insulting speech against medical personnel” after he criticized the response to the outbreak in a WeChat group he shared with his friends.

Bats can carry viruses to others without getting sick themselves, which makes them particularly dangerous for people and for carrying other species of animal ails. Once a human is sick, they pass it on to other humans that don’t engage in eating dangerous meats. Salmonella, on the other hand, only sickens the individual eating it- it won’t infect other people.

* He thinks hospitals can facilitate the spread of the virus as the influx of patients overwhelm their capacity and quarantine zones
* Taxis and Ubers have had known through group messaging that some unknown flu since mid-December, which they thought was SARS.

He's peeved by the government's lack of response. 
* He thinks the current system to treat coronavirus patients have the following issues
   * Information access amongst hospitals for detection and treatment is not integrated for patient
   * There's a lack of medical supplies in hospitals and the population
   * Hospitals are not highly accessible, increasing delays in transit and diagnosis
   * doctors are using devices in non-quarantine sections to communicate with patients in quarantine sectors of the hospital
   * Medical staff are overwhelmed in all facilities
* He suspects the infectivity rate for coronavirus is higher than reported
   * he claims that hospitals only have little over 100 tests for the virus
   * he talked to a patient who has been deferred from one hospital to another saw many family members when he had symptoms, not knowing it may be coronavirus.

Of course it’s not helpful or healthy to run around saying that this is the next Black Plague or anything, but my concern if’s that if we see China fail to keep this from spreading, we not only can see a tremendous amount of unnecessary death from the disease, but the strain on resources and services will lead to a terrible price paid on those who never even come in contact with the virus.

Far from being a ""prophylactic medicine"", as the ministry suggests, this miracle concoction is, in reality, a super-diluted form of arsenic trioxide.

I actually asked a doctor to verify my thoughts on this paper after listing a few observations about the data.  First, the age group of the group is 21-82 with a median of 55.5--that's an older group and it's very obviously not including infection cases of children and young adults who have, so far, been reported as either being asymptomatic or mild cases and only including cases of viral pneumonia that require hospitalization.  So two factors there to bring that mortality figure up to 11% for hospitalized cases (so far) and probably lower when including the total number of infections.  

Now here's where it gets less pretty.  Only 31 patients were discharged and 58% were still in hospital at the time of publishing.  So while 11% died, there are still 58% sitting on the fence of whether they are going to be discharged or die so that 11% can either stay the same or get worse for those hospitalized.  Based on data from the WHO's page,  seasonal flu severely affects 3-5 million annually, resulting in 350-690,000 deaths, which is the closest I could find to what you were wondering--that'd be a cheater's way of figuring that the mortality rate for those severely ill with the flu is 10-14% globally.   However, that's a global figure, which would include all those countries that are not industrialized like China or the US so it's better to look at those two countries.   


The mortality rates for the seasonal flu are 1.6- 2.6 in China vs. 0.1% in the US with the majority of deaths being in older patients (in the US, the mortality rate for seasonal flu for patients over 65 is 1%).  In both countries, (US--74.8% as per CDC, China--90% as per a WHO paper) these severe cases/mortalities tend to be older individuals.  One of the reasons why the flu hits China harder is because they don't have big pushes to use flu vaccines like we do.  Less flu vaccines --> more flu --> more flu related deaths --> higher mortality.  I couldn't find numbers expressly for people hospitalized and deaths out of those for either country.  I imagine that that would be higher as it would likely, again, be older people (or the very young) dying from the flu so the numbers would, in theory be comparable.  I think, haha.  I wish I could find that information expressly.  

What I do know, however, is that doctors are distressed by the mortality rates shown so far for the Wuhan coronavirus.  The first batch of patients (47 with a median age of 49 ) had a mortality rate of around 3%.  The disease takes 2-3 weeks to run its course so the mortality rate for hospitalizations could go up.  

In fact, I just checked with the same doctor who posted this paper and he had someone calculate the range of that paper and it puts the mortality of coronavirus pneumonia hospitalization between 5.7 and 19%.   So, could be lower, could be higher.  Needs more data."

But from what I dug up, the seemingly fast speed of the virus spreading is because of how it is reported in the media. We have real-time dashboards tracking counts and sensationalist articles claiming end-of-the-world pandemics. When you're monitoring these things daily, it can seem quite bleak.


Now consider SARS back in 2003, when coronavirus outbreaks weren't even a thing, and reporting technologies were just in infancy. Compared to today, we were in the dark. And still, with technologies from 2003, we managed to effectively curb the outbreak within 2 months, and eradicate within 6 months.


I'm not saying that it isn't dangerous. But from data we have then and data we have now, it doesn't look like we should be panicking. Cautious optimism (and good hygiene!) seems to be the way to go. Healthcare workers and scientists are moving very fast, and I have full faith that this will be resolved by the end of February."

Nearly all sources I've seen said that the plane could carry 240~ passengers. With roughly 1,000 US citizens in Wuhan it is hard to believe that they wouldn't carry max capacity.

I had assumed the plane was full bringing people with children, elderly, etc when I wasn't granted a seat but that doesn't seem to be the case since there was a report of a Wuhan University student who got a seat. Although he declined in the end. This report says 195 people boarded the plane.

BUT 
I can tell you for a fact that per the CDC in order to be tested for coronavirus a person must have a:1)fever 2) cough 3) travel history to Wuhan. 

There was an article posted today about someone at an American airport who had a fever and cough at screening, but because he was from Beijing he was let go. 

The CDC also seems highly skeptical of H2H transmission and transmission during incubation. By the time they announce an epidemic here it will probably already be bad, if they ever announce one. It is flu season, they may just chalk it up to a bad flu year who knows."

What are the cruise lines and CBJ doing to prepare for the upcoming season and the possibility of the coronavirus arriving on a cruise ship.  I saw this headline today ""Italian cruise ship quarantined with thousands aboard due to possible coronavirus"".  Does the CBJ or SOA have the ability to quarantine a whole cruise ship before any of its passengers disembark.  Are we prepared to do that?  What are the factors that will cause a quarantine?  Are we getting good up to date information from the cruise lines as to infections and will we have a heads up in case of outbreak?"

-

Intro:

In the wake of the coronavirus it has become apparent that people are willing to become xenophobic. This is a concerning trend, one that almost appears socially acceptable. While some level of contagion fear may be reasonable, there is also a pattern of increasing xenophobic rhetoric that is not helpful and very much unreasonable. 

-

There may be an evolutionary reason for xenophobia to emerge during pandemic fears. It may serve as a cultural quarantine mechanism. We should be much smarter than this and stop before it turns into something dangerous. 

-

This article explains how the evolution of extreme altruism leads to the evolution of xenophobia due to the selection pressure provided by pandemic threats. Also eusocial species such as the naked mole rats seem to be Nazis."

Stocks fell and gold prices rose as economists revised their outlooks on the impact and as companies announce closures and financial hits.

￼


Fears that a mysterious and fast-moving virus in China could impact the global economy drove investors to dump stocks on Thursday.

At least 170 people have died, and close to 8,000 are infected by the coronavirus. The vast majority of those cases are in China, but governments around the world are taking steps to contain the virus. Russia on Thursday partially closed its 2,600-mile border with China, and a number of countries have discouraged their citizens from traveling there.
The concern among investors is that efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus will dampen economic activity inside China and possibly elsewhere.

Airlines are suspending flights to the country, and global businesses are temporarily shuttering stores and factories there and warning of the possible financial impact. On Wednesday, Microsoft’s head of investor relations cautioned that a slowdown in computer manufacturing — because of a longer-than-expected shutdown of factories — could affect sales of its Windows software in the United States.
“There will clearly be implications, at least in the near-term, for Chinese output,” said the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, on Wednesday. “We just have to see what the effect is globally.”

On Thursday, investors fled riskier assets like stocks and oil and turned instead into investments that are considered safe havens like gold. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent at the start of trading in the United States; major benchmarks in Europe and Asia were down more than 1 percent.
Early on, economists had speculated that China’s economy would not likely be as badly hit as it was during the 2002-3 SARS epidemic. Some have begun to revise their outlooks as more details emerge about the number of cases and speed of transmission of the coronavirus.

“The risk of contagion is affecting economic activity and financial markets,” analysts at Moody’s Analytics wrote in an email to clients. “The immediate and most significant economic impact is in China but will reverberate globally, given the importance of China in global growth as well as in global company revenue.”

A growing number of companies have also warned that they will have to close or shift operations and could take a financial hit from widespread business disruptions in China.

Though they are cautious, policymakers are also noting that it is too soon to predict the virus’s overall impact.
“It’s very early days and we are, like others, monitoring this quite closely, as you would expect, and, like Chair Powell, I don’t want to speculate in terms of orders of magnitude,” Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said at a news conference on Thursday. “It’s a fast-moving issue,” he added.

Stocks in Tokyo and Seoul closed down 1.7 percent, while in Hong Kong they fell 2.6 percent. China’s markets remain closed for an extended holiday until Feb. 3 but investors punished the stocks of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong.

Traders in Taipei, returning from the Lunar New Year holiday, pushed the market down by 5.8 percent.
Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, hit its lowest price this year before paring some of its losses. It was trading at about $58.75 a barrel.

From Paris to London exchanges in Europe opened in the red, many trading down more than 1 percent.

IOC and WHO talk about fighting new pneumonia.

January 29, 2020 20:08

Dark clouds have begun to rise again at the Tokyo Olympics. Details are as below.

According to German media reports, the DPA has reported that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is in contact with the World Health Organization (WHO).
This is part of measures against new types of pneumonia caused by the new type of coronavirus. Regarding the Tokyo Olympics, which is almost half a year from now, it is said that ""control of infectious diseases is an important factor for safely holding the Games"".
Due to the outbreak of new pneumonia, soccer and basketball Olympic qualifying tournaments have been relocated from China.
Given that the end of SARS that occurred in November 2002 until July 2003 and that new types of pneumonia are spreading more rapidly than SARS, the Tokyo Olympics could be seriously affected. .

> The new coronavirus seems to be less aggressive than SARS and MERS. By Tuesday morning, more than 100 of about 4500 infected people had died - that would correspond to a death rate of about 2 percent. However, this figure is likely to be deceptive, because it is precisely at the beginning of an outbreak that the more severe cases are more likely to become known. Drostens believes that a mortality rate of three percent would be very high. The expert assumes that the ten percent usually given for SARS is also far too high a figure. ""Probably there were much more than the known 8000 SARS cases at that time,"" he explains.

So being conservative with the Spanish Flu death numbers that's a 10% mortality rate, and being liberal with the Swine flu death numbers, that's a 0.03% mortality rate.

You're right, we need more information. I just can't possibly believe that a pandemic as widespread and deadly as the Spanish Flu or the Bubonic Plague could happen in modern times unless there's a new disease which is DRASTICALLY different than anything we've ever seen before, which isn't the case with Coronavirus."

A near 7% dip just based on operating expenses going up last quarter despite over 20% margins last quarter. I personally think the market way over reacted. I thought about buying more contracts but I want an option win before I YOLO (neither of my first two attempts at options closed at strike). 

I know coronavirus has an impact on the market as a whole but the death count is not remaining constant with the infection rate. The USMCA is a win for North American trade for the orange man. If the impeachment hearing ends before SOTU, should have a positive impact on the market. 

Long story, I think it's a solid risk/reward that FB will get back to at least $215. It was just at $223 and revenue grew!!"

Xi himself is pretty shitty, but the CCP in general is doing great work towards alleviating poverty in china. the stats speak for themselves, socialism with chinese characteristics is the best economic model. They've built hospitals with thousands of beds in a matter of weeks in order to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

You've been seeing a wave of anti-china propaganda because china seems ready to take america's spot as the biggest world power, and the US government is shitting their pants trying to hold off the inevitable."
