> SHANGHAI - An outbreak of coronavirus in China is spreading to more cities, Chinese authorities reported on Monday, with 139 new cases found over the weekend, including a third death.

> The new cases, the first inside China outside the central city of Wuhan where the virus was first reported, come as the country gears up for the Lunar New Year holidays later this week, when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel domestically and abroad. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement that 136 new cases of coronavirus had been discovered in the city on Saturday and Sunday.

> Beijing said on Sunday it will increase efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, while health authorities around the world are working to prevent its spread. The new virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.

However, if there are so many cases that the hospitals are overwhelmed, then ""proper medical treatment"" may be nonexistent.

If this thing spreads via aerosol droplets like a cold or flu, and is contagious enough that every victim spreads it to more than 1 person, we could be looking at a scenario similar to the 1918 flu pandemic. The big question right now are (A) how contagious is it, and (B) what's the transmission rate? Also, (C) how does it spread? With it being a coronavirus it could be aerosol droplets or it could be fecal/oral.

The latter scenario -- it spreads in unsanitary conditions but you have to ingest it-- could explain why so many people are linked to a seafood market. Maybe some vendor had dirty hands? Then a few more people spread it to family members, because people are are gross and don't always wash their hands. We could be dealing with a ""typhoid mary"" scenario rather than a an airborne bug. (With it causing pneumonia, it's likely to be spread by aerosol droplets ... but not guaranteed.)

I'm paying close attention to this one, but not overly worried yet.

Even a worst case scenario with this one is not a civilization ending pandemic but it could be a Very Big Deal and kill a lot of people. The world would go on, much as it did after the 1918 Flu, but it would be a very bad time for a lot of people, in ways the modern western world hasn't seen in about a century.

I'm asthmatic, so I would be at high risk. My job, fortunately, would let me work from home in a pandemic scenario, so I'd probably just bug in for the duration, or until they came up with an effect vaccine and I could get a dose. Google Meetings FTW.

> A surge of newly confirmed novel coronavirus cases since Friday in Wuhan has pushed the outbreak total to 198 cases, some of them with no apparent links to the outbreak market, and health officials today announced a case in Shenzhen, China&#039;s first outside of Wuhan.

> The case marks the first in China outside of Wuhan, though three exported illnesses have been reported in other countries-all with ties to Wuhan.

> Michael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH, said the new developments in the outbreak fit with a recent prediction from Imperial College London that Wuhan probably has many more cases than previously reported and that sustained transmission shouldn&#039;t be ruled out.

> The number of cases of a novel virus in China has escalated sharply, with authorities in the city of Wuhan now reporting nearly 200 people infected, an increase of 136 over the weekend.

> The mushrooming in the number of cases, along with confirmation of a case in the Chinese city of Shenzhen and unconfirmed reports of cases in Beijing and Shanghai, adds to evidence that the virus - a coronavirus, from the family that also includes SARS and MERS - can be transmitted from person to person.

> &quot;If three cases have been exported internationally there are bound to be cases in other cities in China. It&#039;s really just a matter of time until cases are detected,&quot; he said.

2020-01-19,DontDoAHit,HealthAnxiety,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/er6xos/is_anyone_else_panicking_about_this_coronavirus/ff27wmn/,"Sorry I keep coming back to comment -- I've just been thinking on this a lot tonight! As I tend to do, LOL. A few other things to consider:

* The mortality rate for the flu is MUCH higher than this is at the moment, every single day. I only say this to put things in perspective. In all likelihood, YOU are NOT going to die of the flu.
* This novel coronavirus is causing pneumonia-like symptoms, sometimes mild and yes sometimes severe -- but with prompt medical treatment, just like SARS, the vast majority of people are surviving. The confirmed deaths are very elderly people and/or people who already had a host of other medical conditions. I know this may not be a huge comfort to immunosuppressed people like me, but that brings me to my next point.
* The WHO, CDC, and medical community are moving very quickly to contain and identify this virus. They've got people working around the clock on it, whose lives are dedicated to these sorts of events. They've already identified the genome of the virus, and have used the data to develop a test for it, so it can be diagnosed, thus expediting its containment. This DNA data of the virus will also give us much more information to arm ourselves with, thereby accelerating our protections against it.
* Also, please consider much of Asia is not new to these kinds of outbreaks. They're very familiar with the protocol involved here and take appropriate measures where necessary.

The limited discussion I've seen on this across the internet has been very fear-mongering, pessimistic, nihilistic, and ill informed, so I hope while I'm not an epidemiologist or anything, that I've been able to help plant some logic in the midst of any anxieties. I know viruses and outbreaks of any kind can be terrifying. I was in high school when the SARS outbreak happened around 2002 and the fear dominated my life for the better part of a year (thanks anxiety!!). 

It is good to remain vigilant to some extent, but we can't and shouldn't give ourselves crippling anxiety over this outbreak. I know this is often something we cannot control, but please, I implore you to look for the voices of reason in the midst of all the sensationalism. I hope this helps someone!!  I figured if I wasn't seeing anyone being the kind of support I needed, then I could be that support for someone else."
