During the House Oversight Committee discussion on the novel coronavirus response, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said some deaths from coronavirus have been discovered posthumously.  

Rep. Harley Rouda asked CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield if it’s possible that some flu patients may have been misdiagnosed and actually had coronavirus.

""The standard practice is the first thing you do is test for influenza, so if they had influenza they would be positive,"" Redfield said.

Rouda then asked Redfield if they are doing posthumous testing.

Redfield said there has been ""a surveillance system of deaths from pneumonia, that the CDC has; it’s not in every city, every state, every hospital.”

Rouda followed up and asked, “So we could have some people in the United States dying for what appears to be influenza when in fact it could be the coronavirus?”

The doctor replied that “some cases have actually been diagnosed that way in the United States today.”"

The worst part is she’s being super defensive about it.

I was in LAX before Christmas for 15 hours due a flight delay.
After flying back, I had “the flu” about a week later, but tested negative. My symptoms were I fet very weak. Chills. Sore throat and a 100-102 ish fever.
I laid in the bed and slept with no phone and no tv anything for 3 days. Waking only to take Tylenol.
After being well for two days, I went to visit my grandmother and I kept my distance but did give her a hug before I left.

6 days later she was admitted to the hospital with a fever and found to have double pneumonia and was having significant trouble breathing.
After 4 days in the hospital, she was sent home with oxygen and has been doing breathing treatments. I am going to take her tomorrow and see if it is worth being tested at this point as she is still not breathing well at all.

Weirdest part is I really didn’t put 2+2 together until about 30 minutes ago talking to my aunt.

Edit: I don’t think I would doxx myself so I will give exact dates and locations.

I flew to LAX on 12/6 and then connected to SFO later that day. I stayed two weeks in Dublin/Pleasanton area and then flew back on the 20th. My flight out of LAX back to home was delayed for over 12 hours and I just roamed the airport.

When I got back, I finally got sick on the 26th and was in the bed with flu like symptoms for 3 days, but tested negative for the flu. I took Tylenol for the pain and fever and slept until the 29th basically. I went and visited her on the 30th and on the 4th of January, she was admitted with severe pneumonia and fluid buildup. She was released on the 8th, but has felt terrible ever since.

Idk if she would still be positive or maybe it did long term damage. :("

1. How many days does it take for the lake to be half full? 

2. How many days does it take for the lake to be over 1% full? 

The answer to question 1 is surprising, but fairly obvious, if you think about it for a moment: 47 days.

The answer to question 2 is even more shocking: the lake only crosses 1% on day 42.

1. In 1988 Italian government helped China pro bono to establish Sichuan's largest emergency medical service centre. Over the next 30 years that medical service centre was of great help to medical services in Sichuan

2. In the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake the Italian Red Cross sent 14 emergency rescue specialist to Mianyang Sichuan and they stayed there for a long time, helping to save 900 people.

Sichuan people remembered these and that's why when the call came up to establish a team to go to Rome three experts from Sichuan immediately put their hands up to return the gratitude."

Trump 2/24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

Trump 2/26: I don’t think it’s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down, not up. But, yeah, I think schools should be preparing and, you know, get ready just in case.” He added: “We have it so well under control. I mean, we really have done a very good job.”

Trump 3/2: “We had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies, and they’re going to have vaccines, I think, relatively soon. And they’re going to have something that makes you better, and that’s going to actually take place we think even sooner.”

Also Trump .3/2: “The United States is right now ranked by far No. 1 in the world for preparedness.”

Trump 3/4: “Well, I think the 3.4 percent is really a false number. Now, this is just my hunch, and — but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it’s very mild. … So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

Trump Two days ago: The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American.”

Also Trump Two Days Ago: So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!

Trump Yesterday: Going up fast. We need the Wall more than ever!

Trump today: The Media should view this as a time of unity and strength. We have a common enemy, actually, an enemy of the World, the CoronaVirus. We must beat it as quickly and safely as possible. There is nothing more important to me than the life & safety of the United States!

Trump Now:  On January 31, 2020, I issued Proclamation 9984 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus and Other Appropriate Measures To Address This Risk).  I found that the potential for widespread transmission of a novel (new) coronavirus (which has since been renamed “SARS-CoV-2” and causes the disease COVID-19) (“SARS-CoV-2” or “the virus”) by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. "

He is currently hospitalized at Mercy Health St. Joseph Warren Hospital. He is one of five people in the state that tested positive with the coronavirus.
“I feel like I am dying,” the man told us during a telephone interview Thursday.  “It’s bad. I knew it had to be more than a flu.”
He said he started feeling sick last week and went to the hospital Sunday.
“They said you have pneumonia and asked if I had been to China,” the man said. “I told them no.  They asked if I knew someone who went to China and I said no.” He said he isn’t sure how he got it.
The father of four said he is now in isolation and is concerned for the hospital staff.
“I don’t want to get anyone else sick,” the man said.
He also urges anyone who does not feel well to get checked out.
“This was worse than the flu I had before and I knew it had to be something else,” the man said. “I am just hoping now I didn’t give it to anyone else.”"

Your immune system does not respond until the cells start turning into little factories.

So by the time you start fighting it you are already infected.

If your body has never seen the virus before it does not know how to fight it. It takes time for your body to develop antibodies specific to the virus.

So if you have never been exposed to a particular virus and have no antibodies the virus gets a huge head start and will likely have infected a significant number of cells each producing more of the virus before your immune system starts creating the right antibodies with the right “key” to bind to the virus and stop it.

Once you have been exposed and recover your body maintains antibodies in your system. So future exposures are quickly stopped as antibodies quickly  bind to the virus before it has a chance to infect cells and start reproducing. So you have “immunity” at least from that strain of the virus."

These medical equipments are the medical equipments that are used in hospital (or distributed to people), including medical mask, medicine, ventilators, plasma from normal people and recovered patient.

The one mentioned in the post is from Zhejiang Province, hometown for the majority of  Chinese in Italy. It's an extra amount of stuff and has nothing related to the first plane.

It’s a trite but true saying most often applied to comparisons drawn from the distant past.

>Today we have a choice. We can learn from the recent past – from the experience of Wuhan, China’s fight against the coronavirus – or we can repeat the distant past, ending up with a pandemic reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish flu.

>Though Wuhan has had the most cases of the coronavirus so far, if we continue much further along our national path of purposeful unpreparedness, specious comparisons, politicking ,
hesitation and ineptitude in our response to the pandemic, only our most lucky cities will be comparable to Wuhan. Learning from Wuhan’s
recent past – and rapidly acting on those lessons – is the only way we can prevent our nation from driving itself into a historic catastrophe.

>In a city of nearly 11 million, Wuhan’s approximately 67,000 cases amount to just 0.6% of its population. And despite the difficulty of obtaining accurate data amid the crisis, the World Health Organization (WHO) ground reports verify the numbers coming out of the city as credible. Given the (relatively high) estimated rates of transmissibility of this virus, how did Chinese officials in Wuhan keep it from spreading more rapidly?
Wuhan’s initial approach to the virus was to deny its existence, downplay its severity, and delay action. That errant approach is arguably responsible for the early-stage massive growth in infections caused by the new virus, infections that quickly overwhelmed the highly modern hospital system in the city.

>According to a top WHO official returning from Wuhan, the coronavirus is the “ Wayne Gretzky of viruses”. Initially the virus is unassuming and seems unthreatening – spreading to others even before symptoms appear – yet it’s ruthlessly effective, as it can cause a slow, prolonged death, maximizing its spread.

>As soon as it was clear that the virus was swamping healthcare in Wuhan and threatening to engulf China more broadly, the Chinese government implemented radical social distancing measures, coupled with abundant free testing, attempting to slow the virus’s spread.

>Yet, even these social distancing measures – stopping outbound transportation, stalling public transit and driving, implementing mandatory mask-wearing, cancelling social gatherings, and requiring home quarantines – proved insufficient to halt the expansion of the virus.

>Then, on 1 February, Wuhan switched to centralized quarantine, a decision that research has shown was essential in containing the spread of the virus to such a small portion of the city’s population. By delaying the implementation of the more radical measures, Wuhan let their problem metastasize. Their governmental hesitation produced more deaths.

>Still, it could have been much, much worse. Chinese officials saved tens of thousands of lives by acting as decisively as they did, when they did. And the city’s path to containment has provided invaluable information and time for the rest of the world to get ahead of the virus.

>In the US, we’re following Wuhan’s initial strategy of deny, downplay and delay without substantial indication that we’ll be willing to take the radical measures necessary to slow the spread of the virus. US officials are employing part of the Chinese playbook: the bad part. Unfortunately, this strategy is putting us solidly on course for a replay of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

>While we’re probably past containment, we can still mitigate. Each day of inaction increases the probability our healthcare systems become overwhelmed by the long-lasting sickness. If we don’t act now, we’ll soon be asking: whose life is worth more? With the majority of the nation at risk, we have no time to waste.

>Now isn’t the time for piecemeal efforts and calm, counterproductive comparisons . Now is the time for unified dramatic social, civic and governmental action – including immediate and mandatory social distancing in all areas with demonstrated community spread coupled with mass-scale quarantines. It’s time to follow the good part of the Wuhan playbook.

>China used the analogy to war to mobilize its people’s response to the virus. It’s apt. The cost of further avoidance will be measured in the
hundreds of thousands of ugly deaths of our loved ones.

>Very few of us were alive to see the devastation of 1918, and we can only imagine the horrors of what could have happened had Wuhan not acted as they did. As we both watched this crisis start to unfold months ago, we worried that we might be on course for many of US cities to be as bad as Wuhan. Today we realize: we would be lucky to be Wuhan."

As a matter of fact, many Chinese people know the average salary for doctors in Italy is much higher than China, and they hope Italy may pay Chinese doctors well, maybe equally.

How would this be accomplished? Nationwide martial law? The closure of all public roads and highways? Mandatory fines or imprisonment? 

Where would college students or boarding school students go? 

What would families who depend on another family member currently in another part of the country do?

What kind of economic stimuli would be required to prevent people from starving or not being able to pay for their homes and apartments?

How will we ensure continuity of education for school children?

How do we account for the large percentage of homes without internet access when considering basically anything that has to do with remote or online transitions?

How would we mobilize the military and national guards without contributing further to the nationwide spread?

How would we deal with nationwide protests that might turn violent in a country where people are guaranteed freedom of movement between all members of the union?

How would we transport food and medical supplies in an underemployed, understaffed, and locked down country?

How would we take care of the people in our prison systems who often face the most neglect and antipathy during times of crisis?

These questions seem easy to answer but they are not. The United States is not a homogenous country where solutions can be applied nationwide. There will inevitably be failures, and those failures will be catastrophic.
