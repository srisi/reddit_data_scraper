-Chinese who smoke were more likely to succumb to covid-19,  America will likely have similar numbers due to obesity working similarly. 

-this is not just an ‚Äúold person‚Äôs‚Äù disease, there are high numbers in their 40s as well

-cruelest human experiment in modern history is keeping people on cruise ships. We need to let them dock and quarantine

-masks don‚Äôt work (EDIT: thank you u/cerebrist for letting me know that he does say ‚Äúsurgical masks don't work but N95s are ""very effective."" He says this later in the podcast when Rogan asked him more specifically about masks.‚Äù) 

-we should carefully consider closing schools. Due to kids not getting sick (similar with hepatitis a) the fact that 38% of nurses rely on school and childcare for their kids so they can work, we shouldn‚Äôt really jump to closing schools

-received an email from a nurse in Milan. They are choosing who to save and the situation is dire. They stopped testing healthcare staff for covid-19 because at this point they need all hands on deck

-he saw this coming and wrote a book about it back in 2017 (Deadliest Enemy). Even projected it coming out of China and interrupting supply chains. Businesses need to wise up and diversify

Ok, you got the virus, you'll go to the hospital and you'll very likely be fine in few days, but what happens when thousands of people need to be hospitalized in the same structure? Some of them will be left behind and won't be treated, the oldest ones. Now, what happens if a wave of children will be infected? oldest ones (like 30-40yo) left behind.  


What happens if you have a serious car crash nearby and need medication? You'll have to be moved to another hospital, maybe far, hoping to reach that in time.  


This scenario is not fruit of my imagination: in few hospitals in Italy they **started to not treat** some of the oldest people. Very few cases of this, but happened, this is why we are under lockdown.  


I just hope my english is good enough for this to be understood.

Please don't alarm yourself, but when your government will get why this virus is serious (I'm confident very soon), follow the basic guidelines we all already know (washing hands often and so on).

https://twitter.com/jasonvanschoor/status/1237142891077697538

From twitter feed talking about northern Italy March 9

From a well respected friend and intensivist/A&E consultant who is currently in northern Italy: 1/ ‚ÄòI feel the pressure to give you a quick personal update about what is happening in Italy, and also give some quick direct advice about what you should do.  

2/ First, Lumbardy is the most developed region in Italy and it has a extraordinary good healthcare, I have worked in Italy, UK and Aus and don‚Äôt make the mistake to think that what is happening is happening in a 3rd world country.  

3/ The current situation is difficult to imagine and numbers do not explain things at all. Our hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid-19, they are running 200% capacity  

4/ We‚Äôve stopped all routine, all ORs have been converted to ITUs and they are now diverting or not treating all other emergencies like trauma or strokes. There are hundreds of pts with severe resp failure and many of them do not have access to anything above a reservoir mask.  

5/ Patients above 65 or younger with comorbidities are not even assessed by ITU, I am not saying not tubed, I‚Äôm saying not assessed and no ITU staff attends when they arrest. Staff are working as much as they can but they are starting to get sick and are emotionally overwhelmed.  

6/ My friends call me in tears because they see people dying in front of them and they con only offer some oxygen. Ortho and pathologists are being given a leaflet and sent to see patients on NIV. PLEASE STOP, READ THIS AGAIN AND THINK.  

7/ We have seen the same pattern in different areas a week apart, and there is no reason that in a few weeks it won‚Äôt be the same everywhere, this is the pattern:  

8/ 1)A few positive cases, first mild measures, people are told to avoid ED but still hang out in groups, everyone says not to panick 2)Some moderate resp failures and a few severe ones that need tube, but regular access to ED is significantly reduced so everything looks great  

9/ 3)Tons of patients with moderate resp failure, that overtime deteriorate to saturate ICUs first, then NIVs, then CPAP hoods, then even O2. 4)Staff gets sick so it gets difficult to cover for shifts, mortality spikes also from all other causes that can‚Äôt be treated properly.  

10/ Everything about how to treat them is online but the only things that will make a difference are: do not be afraid of massively strict measures to keep people safe,

11/ if governments won‚Äôt do this at least keep your family safe, your loved ones with history of cancer or diabetes or any transplant will not be tubed if they need it even if they are young. By safe I mean YOU do not attend them and YOU decide who does and YOU teach them how to.  

12/ Another typical attitude is read and listen to people saying things like this and think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs bad dude‚Äù and then go out for dinner because you think you‚Äôll be safe.  

13/ We have seen it, you won‚Äôt be if you don‚Äôt take it seriously. I really hope it won‚Äôt be as bad as here but prepare."

Also I'm so tired of these articles using the Korea argument when there are 7500 cases in South Korea and 58 of them are dead, which means they have a case fatality rate of ~0.8%, but the problem is you can't calculate a fatality rate based on the total number of cases when almost all of those cases still haven't recovered.

Out of the 7500 cases in South Korea, only 250 individuals have recovered and ~7200 are still infected.

We don't know how many of the 7200 infected will recover and how many will die. This estimate of 0.8% is assuming that all of the 7200 people will recover and that the mortality rate will stay constant.

It's ridiculous to do the math with the assumption that every one of them will recover and then marvel at how much lower their fatality rate rate is."

For those in countries who deal with health care in a humane fashion: 

In the US you usually have a copay, or a portion of a particular expense you're responsible for. So, for example, if you have a 20% copay on a $4,000 Coronavirus test, you owe $800. 

The problem is, you also have something called a deductible, which is an amount of money you must pay out of pocket in a given year before -any- insurance benefits kick in.

Homemade masks absolutely work and they're a scalable and low cost solution to protecting yourself! [A cotton t-shirt or tea towel fashioned into an improvised mask](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic) has been shown to be ~60% as effective as a surgical mask. It's not ideal but it's far better than nothing and something most people can make with material on hand. [There are videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJaVBt8q6g8) on how to make masks from everyday materials (I just picked the first one I could find, I can't vouch for it's quality. Please suggest better resources and I will update this post).

If you don't have access to commercial masks, make sure every time you go out in public, you have at least something covering your nose and mouth (if only to prevent you from touching them). 

Avoid eating out as much as you can as it's the one time where it's impractical to be masked. If you must eat out, sit at the table so nobody is directly facing each other and find the table the furthest away from other tables if possible. Otherwise, takeout (better), delivery (even better) and cooking at home (best) should be your preferred strategies for nutrition.

Also, if you wear both glasses and contacts, go outside with your glasses on, they've been shown to help you avoid touching your eyes. If you don't wear glasses, a simple pair of drugstore ""fashion"" glasses (with lenses in them) is a cheap form of insurance. Goggles like you see in a science lab are better if they're still available where you are.

When you arrive home, wash your hands, take off any PPE and then wash your hands again. If your PPE is made from cloth only, then boil/steam your PPE and let it completely dry before using again. Otherwise, figure out the best way to sterilize with materials you have on hand but always allow to air dry until completely dry and then wait a few more hours before reusing. If absolutely necessary and for fragile materials such as N95 masks, you can hang in a well ventilated place and allow to air dry for 5 days before using again if this is your best option (although the science is still unclear on whether the virus can last for 5 days on a dry, fabric surface). 

All of this is simple, basic stuff that can reduce your chances of getting sick, not to zero, but to a substantial enough margin that it's a no-brainer not to do it.

In the medical profession, our highest priority is the well-being of our patients. To us, the situation in Italy seems likely to happen here, a situation that is intolerable from an ethical point of view when it could be preventable.

Our government seems to take a view that they are happy to take the risk that it doesn't happen, or accept the mortality costs if it does happen, in order to make (relative) economic gains in the shorter term. I believe our prime minister specifically suggested allowing the virus to work its way through the population and for us to 'take it on the chin'.

At this late stage, it is not about preventing spread. It is about delaying spread to allow our healthcare system not to be overwhelmed. 

In terms of re-spread, one would hope that quarantine measures and restrictions on international travel or screening of travellers will take that into account."

>**The horror of corona on the plane - passengers released with zero checks**  
>  
>THE SPREAD OF THE CORONAVIRUS Published March 10, 2020 at 8:19 pm  
>  
>A special flight, chartered by STS Alpresor, this weekend gathered Swedish travelers who were in different parts of the Italian Alps and flew them to Stockholm. The flight, which took off from Lyon in France as SAS stopped flying from the affected regions in Italy at the time, landed on Sunday night at Arlanda in Stockholm.   
>  
>Expressen has been in contact with a traveler who, along with his friends, was on the plane.   
>  
>\- It was the most surreal flight of my life, says the person.   
>  
>**""Woman lay on a whole row and coughed straight out""**  
>  
>On the flight, there were at least five people who coughed a lot and who ""seemed generally ill,"" according to the traveler.   
>  
>\- At one point a woman lay on her back on a whole row and coughed straight out in the cabin, later she stood in the middle of the crowd in the arrivals hall and continued to cough regardless of the elderly and children who were nearby. She and the many others should never have come along or alternatively been placed separated from us without symptoms.  
>  
>Another passenger initially sat in the same part of the plane as the woman and says that the coughing became more and more intense, but that no action was taken.   
>  
>\- After a few hours she seems to be getting worse and lying down on the seat with her head facing the aisle and coughing up in the air. At this point, me and my fellow travelers are moving to the front of the plane.   
>  
>According to the passengers, the flight attendants wore gloves and repeated several times that it was a special flight because of the coronavirus.   
>  
>\- The flight attendants and the pilot announced in the loudspeakers that all in-flight service was canceled, even water, and that the front toilets were locked for the crew, which was perfectly understandable. They were also told that they would wear masks that never went on, says one of the travelers.   
>  
>\- Despite the situation, there were several people around us who complained about the lack of service, at the same time as the coughing intensified in the cabin.  
>  
>**No restrictions when the plane landed**  
>  
>When the plane landed at Arlanda, everyone got off. The coughing woman and the others walked around the crowd and coughed in their hands or straight out, says one of the travelers. It seemed like everyone went home on their own, without any restrictions.   
>  
>\- There was a sign at the exit from the baggage claim where there was something small about the virus. Completely different from France and especially Italy. The people should never have been allowed to board or alternatively had their face mask and been placed as secluded as possible from the seemingly healthy passengers, says one of the travelers.   
>  
>The travelers are not critical of STS Alpresor or SAS per se, but rather to the authorities in Sweden who - based on what they saw that day - let a possible infection spread further.   
>  
>**One passenger has now been tested for coronavirus**  
>  
>On Tuesday, it became clear that someone in the company had become ill and was now awaiting test results as to whether it was Corona.   
>  
>Lovisa Ernestam is the Deputy Head of Press at the state-owned company Swedavia, which operates, among other things, Arlanda Airport. She says that the restrictions that apply, apply to airlines from specific countries and that only IranAir from Iran has not been granted permission to fly to Sweden.  
>  
>\- As far as infection spreads and coronavirus are concerned, we are in constant contact with responsible authorities in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãinfection protection, who are constantly assessing the situation. They completely control what we do and don't do at the airports. We have many travel days with lots of ski charter from the Alps during the sports holiday weeks.   
>  
>\- During several major travel days, the health care was also present in the arrivals hall when the flights landed. The Public Health Authority has signage in place that tells what travelers should think about if they have traveled to affected areas.  
>  
>At several international airports in other countries, temperature controls on travelers arriving from infected areas have been introduced, but not in Sweden. The reason is that it has not been possible to show that it is effective.   
>  
>State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said in an interview with SvD on Saturday that it is easier to have control over the situation if the population acts as usual, even those who have been in northern Italy.   
>  
>\- The risk is that if a person who is healthy needs to stay home from work, that person does other things instead, and may meet other people who may be more difficult to track.  
>  
>Expressen has reached out to STS Alpresor, SAS and the Public Health Authority for comments."

A series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing came during the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier.
By Sheri Fink and Mike Baker

Updated 10:06 p.m. ET

A research project in Seattle tried to conduct early tests for the new coronavirus but ran into red tape before circumventing federal officials and confirming a case.Grant Hindsley for The New York Times
Dr. Helen Y. Chu, an infectious disease expert in Seattle, knew that the United States did not have much time.
In late January, the first confirmed American case of the coronavirus had landed in her area. Critical questions needed answers: Had the man infected anyone else? Was the deadly virus already lurking in other communities and spreading?
As luck would have it, Dr. Chu had a way to monitor the region. For months, as part of a research project into the flu, she and a team of researchers had been collecting nasal swabs from residents experiencing symptoms throughout the Puget Sound region.
To repurpose the tests for monitoring the coronavirus, they would need the support of state and federal officials. But nearly everywhere Dr. Chu turned, officials repeatedly rejected the idea, interviews and emails show, even as weeks crawled by and outbreaks emerged in countries outside of China, where the infection began.
By Feb. 25, Dr. Chu and her colleagues could not bear to wait any longer. They began performing coronavirus tests, without government approval.
What came back confirmed their worst fear. They quickly had a positive test from a local teenager with no recent travel history. The coronavirus had already established itself on American soil without anybody realizing it.
‚ÄúIt must have been here this entire time,‚Äù Dr. Chu recalled thinking with dread. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just everywhere already.‚Äù
In fact, officials would later discover through testing, the virus had already contributed to the deaths of two people, and it would go on to kill 20 more in the Seattle region over the following days.
Federal and state officials said the flu study could not be repurposed because it did not have explicit permission from research subjects; the labs were also not certified for clinical work. While acknowledging the ethical questions, Dr. Chu and others argued there should be more flexibility in an emergency during which so many lives could be lost. On Monday night, state regulators told them to stop testing altogether.
The failure to tap into the flu study, detailed here for the first time, was just one in a series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing during the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier. Instead, local officials across the country were left to work blindly as the crisis grew undetected and exponentially.
Even now, after weeks of mounting frustration toward federal agencies over flawed test kits and burdensome rules, states with growing cases such as New York and California are struggling to test widely for the coronavirus. The continued delays have made it impossible for officials to get a true picture of the scale of the growing outbreak, which has now spread to at least 36 states and Washington, D.C.
Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview on Friday that acting quickly was critical for combating an outbreak. ‚ÄúTime matters,‚Äù he said.
He insisted that despite the rocky start, there was still time to beat back the coronavirus in the United States. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take rigorous, aggressive public health ‚Äî what I like to say, block and tackle, block and tackle, block and tackle, block and tackle,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat means if you find a new case, you isolate it.‚Äù
But the Seattle Flu Study illustrates how existing regulations and red tape ‚Äî sometimes designed to protect privacy and health ‚Äî have impeded the rapid rollout of testing nationally, while other countries ramped up much earlier and faster. Faced with a public health emergency on a scale potentially not seen in a century, the United States has not responded nimbly.
The C.D.C.‚Äôs own effort to create a system for monitoring the virus around the country, using established government surveillance networks for the flu, has not yet built steam. And as late as last week, after expanding authorizations for commercial and academic institutions to make tests, administration officials provided conflicting accounts of when a significant increase in tests would be available.
In states like Maine, Missouri and Michigan, where there are few or no known infections, state public health officials say they have more than enough tests to meet demand.
But it remains unclear how many Americans have been tested for the coronavirus. The C.D.C. says approximately 8,500 specimens or nose swabs have been taken since the beginning of the outbreak ‚Äî a figure that is almost certainly larger than the number of people tested since one person can have multiple swabs. By comparison, South Korea, which discovered its first case around the same time as the United States, has reported having the capacity to test roughly 10,000 people a day since late February.
A prime mission
As soon as the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was published in January, the C.D.C.‚Äôs first job was to develop a diagnostic test. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our prime mission,‚Äù Dr. Redfield said, ‚Äúto get eyes on this thing.‚Äù
The agency also released criteria for deciding which individuals should be tested for the virus ‚Äî at first only those who had a fever and respiratory issues and had traveled from the outbreak‚Äôs origin in Wuhan, China.
The criteria were so strict that the sick man in the Seattle area who had visited Wuhan did not meet it. Still, worried state health officials pushed to get him checked, and the C.D.C. agreed. Local officials sent a sample to Atlanta and the results came back positive.
Officials monitored 70 people who were in contact with the man, including 50 who consented to getting nose swabs, and none tested positive for the coronavirus. But there was still the possibility that someone had been missed, said Dr. Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for communicable diseases.
Around this time, the Washington State Department of Health began discussions with the Seattle Flu Study already going on in the state.
But there was a hitch: The flu project primarily used research laboratories, not clinical ones, and its coronavirus test was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And so the group was not certified to provide test results to anyone outside of their own investigators. They began discussions with state, C.D.C. and F.D.A. officials to figure out a solution, according to emails and interviews.
Dr. Scott F. Dowell, a former high-ranking C.D.C. official and a current deputy director at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which funds the Seattle Flu Study, asked for help from the leaders of the C.D.C.‚Äôs coronavirus response. ‚ÄúHoping there is a solution,‚Äù he wrote on Feb. 10.
Later, Dr. Lindquist, the state epidemiologist in Washington, wrote an email to Dr. Alicia Fry, the chief of the C.D.C.‚Äôs epidemiology and prevention branch, requesting the study be used to test for the coronavirus.
C.D.C. officials repeatedly said it would not be possible. ‚ÄúIf you want to use your test as a screening tool, you would have to check with F.D.A.,‚Äù Gayle Langley, an officer at the C.D.C.‚Äôs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, wrote back in an email on Feb. 16. But the F.D.A. could not offer the approval because the lab was not certified as a clinical laboratory under regulations established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a process that could take months.
Dr. Chu and Dr. Lindquist tried repeatedly to wrangle approval to use the Seattle Flu Study. The answers were always no.
‚ÄúWe felt like we were sitting, waiting for the pandemic to emerge,‚Äù Dr. Chu said. ‚ÄúWe could help. We couldn‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù"

So this weekend was actually really interesting because despite the fact that there was a big blockbuster family movie released (Pixar's Onward) it actually underperformed expectations by alot. There's probably reasons beyond Coronavirus for that - the movie's trailers haven't been getting big buzz and it has one of the lowest audience ratings ""Cinemascores"" for a Pixar movie since Cars 2 - but another factor was that there were far fewer ""walkups"" than normal, basically business from people that didn't buy tickets in advance. In fact, Sunday had unusually low business, resulting in the film's gross going almost a million below estimates. It implies that at least some families started getting hesitant to go to the theatre as the weekend got nearer, which is notable considering the fact that official case numbers only really started to grow  during and after the weekend. 

That having been said, a couple of movies thats relatively big with older audiences - The Way Back and Invisible Man - did pretty good/okay-for-the-kind-of-movie-it-is business over the weekend, so that's also something to look out for."

In the case that ventilators are hard to come by and hospitals are oversaturated, I thought it would be helpful to the world to be able to 3D print a reliable Arduino-driven ventilator. There are a few examples online. I linked to one that looks relatively easy to build.

I am fairly new to 3d printing and design and would like help to replicate the device in the paper I linked and publish it on [thingiverse.com](https://thingiverse.com).

Let me know your thoughts.

edit:

The paper states that 1.5 Nm was required for maximum volume delivery. I was thinking a Nema 17 or 23 with 5:1 reducer would work well.

Bag Valve Masks are relatively cheap as well:

Or if there's no proven therapeutic benefit they may not cover it.

Sure, they'll pay for ecmo or a vent (minus your deductible) because that's a proven treatment for ARDS but they may balk at unproven outpatient meds, in particular. I bet some of the less scrupulous insurers are looking at making hydroxychloroquine a prior auth drug (if it isn't already) because it's not a proven treatment for coronavirus ... that's the sort of thing you'll run into."

Sounds like a great idea.  I've plenty of 3D print experience and would like to help.  There is an army of 3D printer hobbyist that I'm sure would support and print components and help assembly.   So it would be easy to promote and get more people involved, but  they need more concrete designs and instructions.  

I've some questions to help get the conversation started:

I've read the paper but it's from 2010, do you have more up-to-date information?  
Is there a specific design that you have in mind? If so, send link
What are the costs of the non-3D components? Do you have a list of these components?  Are they easily bought by the public?
Is this device realistically a viable treatment for patients needing ventilators?

I'm interested, just need more information.  I've ICU doctors that can give feedback and hopefully trial a prototype.  The problem for them is assurances that the device provides the advertised oxygen levels and that it won't break down.  They may have issues with certification in some countries, but that's a hurdle for later."

My sister is in a small nursing home. Today the governor closed off visitation access to nursing homes, and I'm not disagreeing with it. That's not what this post is about. I understand why he didn't oh, I understand that it protect my sister, I understand that it protects the health care workers in the home. I support all of that. 

My sister is on a feeding tube and severely mentally and physically handicapped. She cannot speak for herself. I am pretty much her voice, because I understand her best. And with the exception of my husband she is the only direct family member I have left. so this is very personally frightening to me right now. I miss her and I love her and there is no way to really tell her why I have to stay away but what we all fear.

On Sunday I felt a little scratchy in my throat and did not go to the nursing home, even though I doubted very seriously I had been exposed. I appreciate the governor, honestly, for taking this step and relieving me of the guilt of choosing whether or not to visit everyday and the fear of every person I see and my interaction with them.

Even so, to not have daily access to her is frightening and it breaks my heart a little

I'm just posting here because I needed to talk about it. Thanks for reading."
