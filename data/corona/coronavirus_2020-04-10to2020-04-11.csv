Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

Maybe it felt like it flew by or maybe every day was a slow crawl for you, but the destination was the same - another week closer to better days.

It's worth a reminder that every single day is another day full of data that helps us narrow down the most effective treatments and really get a better understanding of the virus itself. We have so many questions still and likely will for a while to come, but we've answered some questions too.

Does social distancing work? **YES**. This has been the resounding answer from medical and scientific experts around the world as we've seen cases plateauing and even best case predictions being remodeled to show vast improvements in the number of people who will avoid infection or beat the virus. The current estimation for COVID-19 deaths in the United States is roughly **40% lower** than the _best_ case scenario originally modeled by experts. These models are being updated daily and show that the hardest time to come up with these kinds of figures is on the fly in the middle of a pandemic. So if you see something that scares you, know that it's constantly in flux and in almost every case likely to be lower when all is said and done.

Can we tell who already had it and recovered? Yes, thanks to **antibody tests**! We've come far in the last week here, as there are already labs in the U.S. joining in on the antibody trials other countries have begun to try to gauge the true spread of the virus by finding people who might have been asymptomatic or mildly ill and recovered without going to a doctor or getting a formal test. This does at least two good things for us.

One, we're able to see who might already have immunity to the virus (we're not yet 100% sure having the antibodies makes you immune but if it follows the pattern of many, many other viruses that should be the case) and those people could take on a more active role in the healthcare industry and in the economy as a whole in a much safer way. If that cold you had in March turned out to be COVID-19 and now you have some level of immunity to the virus, it's much easier to allow you to interact with sick or at risk groups or resume a gradually more normal day to day life as restrictions are lifted. If you're a healthcare worker who asymptomatically became infected and have since recovered, you could fill more at-risk roles for people who don't have that extra immunity boost. There is still a lot of research needed here, but it's so promising to see countries placing priority on antibody testing alongside vaccine development and treatment trials.

Two, the antibody data gives us a much clearer view of how much the virus has spread and if any pockets of herd immunity already exist (multiple researchers have suggested this might be the case in California! Source: [ABC News on Stanford study](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abc7news.com/amp/coronavirus-covid-19-herd-immunity-california/6091220/)). As we find more mild and asymptomatic cases that were never reported, we start to see the real percentage of cases that become serious and need hospital care and the real fatality rates, both of which will drop as these cases are discovered.

I know a lot of this isn't new to people who frequent this thread but sometimes a reminder is nice that people with years of experience and specialized training are looking into these avenues of data gathering so we can get as complete a picture of this disease as we can. There is not a single second of a single day right now where there aren't tests being run, trails being conducted, and data being recorded and analyzed all in one single effort - to grind this virus into the ground and save lives in the process.

We're already 1/3 of the way through April, believe it or not. Some countries and states and cities are getting ready to say ""the worst is behind us"" and some are a week or two off from being able to say the same. It isn't some far off goal now. It's happening. We will still have tough days but it will not last forever.

You're going to feel better and you're going to be stronger when this is over.

Sorry I'm a little light on hard data and citations on this one. I'm worn out from moving apartments (really wish I didn't have to do that during all this but hey, at least I have an oven that works now). I hope everyone here has a wonderful weekend at home and stays safe ❤️"

The top U.S. infectious disease official says coronavirus antibody tests are just days away.

Dr. Anthony Fauci says at the last White House coronavirus task force meeting, the people responsible for developing, validating and disseminating the tests were saying “a rather large number of tests” will be available within a week.

Fauci told CNN on Friday he’s ”certain that that’s going to happen.”

An antibody test could show whether a person was recently exposed to the coronavirus. Fauci says the test would say “that you were infected and if you’re feeling well you very likely recovered.”

Fauci says medical experts could then try to determine how deeply the virus “has penetrated the society” and whether previously infected people would be vulnerable to reinfection, which is particularly “important for health care workers.

There actually has been a lot of good news coming that unsurprisingly has been hard to find on r/coronavirus.

Every day more information shows this virus is more contagious and less lethal then we think.

That’s why the lockdowns are working so well: r0 is reduced and we haven’t seen hospitals overfilled anywhere in the US, even in New York. Some states aren’t even under lockdown and haven’t been affected nearly as much as predicted.

Also, we found links to cases in the US as early as January. Suggesting this disease was spreading well before originally thought.

In Germany’s hardest hit city, antibody tests were run and it found[ 14-20% of the population had antibodies](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fxp6ux/heinsberg_covid19_caseclusterstudy_initial_results/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  vs 2% currently positive for coronavirus : **Putting their most doomsday fatality rate at .37%** Much different than reported case fatality rates of 3-10% reported around the world. 

Other serological studies are putting the IFR even lower to .1% range, [like the FEMA analysis today, which put a worst case IFR at .15%](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fykakc/fema_coronavirus_predictions_published_april_9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

No, there is no evidence that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine will provide a “miracle” treatment to stave off the infection. No, there won’t be a vaccine for at least a year.

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

This was a lot of people assuming the worst. Everyone seems to forget this happened when they are wondering why the market is going up. There were initial models for total deaths between 1 and 2 MILLION, that dropped to 100,000 quickly. Almost everyday for the past two weeks the models have shown improved numbers for total deaths and number of days until the peak cases. Total deaths projected are now down to 60,000 or roughly the same as some flu years. So yes over the past weeks the virus has spread more and killed more people BUT it has spread less and killed less than the models predicted. So investors like myself have been buying in because of the models have been improving. If you have a long term view of the market, it has been dramatically undervalued the past month. I’ve made a considerable amount of money pumping cash into the bottom of this thing. And people keep saying it’s going to tank again.... good, I have stop losses setup and I’ll pull my profits out and buy back in at lower prices, but to be honest I don’t think it’s going back down again and that’s why people are upset. They are mad they missed out on the buying opportunities that others capitalized on."

California is sitting at 13% - their testing is actually less aggressive than Texas; New Jersey is over 55%, and New York is at 40% positive- they are still playing massive catch-up. Nationwide, the US is at about 20%. 

As of right now, Texas simply has not been hit that hard yet. Despite our lax testing, we are just not seeing it spread that fast. 

Attribute it to whatever you want - low urban density, sheer luck, suburban/exurban lifestyles, a natural “prepper” mindset, etc. So far, Texas is playing this pandemic round on easy mode. 

Let’s hope it stays that way."

In the US, conservatives are better at voting in adverse conditions than liberals, so higher turnout generally favors Democrats. The Democrat governor wanted to postpone the primary election due to Coronavirus. The Republican controlled legislature sued saying the Governor did not have the right to postpone the election unilaterally without the legislature’s approval, and the state Supreme Court agreed. So the election went forward, even though not everybody got the absentee ballots they requested and heavily Democrat Milwaukee only had 5 voting stations available versus the normal couple hundred or something, so lines were absurd and some people chose not to vote rather than risk catching COVID19 in line."

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian last month floated the theory that the coronavirus may have been created by the U.S. Army.


China has been buying up ads on U.S. social-media sites and adopting online tactics reminiscent of Russian disinformation campaigns in an apparent attempt to shape the story internationally about the coronavirus response, according to researchers analyzing the activity.

The efforts include ad purchases on Facebook Inc. promoting the English-language arms of Chinese state-media outlets, as well as posts there and on Twitter Inc.’s platform that in some cases disparage U.S. efforts to fight the global pandemic, the researchers say.

From mid-February until early March, social-media sites linked to Chinese state media posted more than 3,300 times a day, triple the normal rate, according to Recorded Future, a Somerville, Mass.-based cybersecurity consulting firm. Those outlets were principally active on Facebook and Twitter, the research showed.


The Chinese tweets, researchers say, evoke Russia’s tactics, which involved spreading messages that can incite doubt and stir anger about basic facts and sometimes promote fictitious claims. Russia also leaned heavily on state media to spread its message online."

Researchers from the Nijmegen Radboudumc have made an important discovery in the course of corona disease.  This can be of great importance in the treatment of the pulmonary virus, the researchers announced in a publication on the scientific platform Preprints.

How is it that in some cases the lungs of corona patients deteriorate so rapidly? 

 

The researchers followed a number of patients closely, and concluded that the shortness of breath of the patients could not just be the result of an infection.



We are in the process of setting up our first treatments



Frank van de Veerdonk, Internist-infectiologist at the Radboudumc

Frank van de Veerdonk, internist-infectiologist at the Radboudumc: ""We had the idea that during this process the very small blood vessels in the lungs also leak.  That leakage causes problems for the lungs, because they are partly full.""



""Set up treatments now.

One possible reason is that an important enzyme - called ACE2 - is sidelined by corona.  ACE2 is important for the human body, among other things to keep the substance bradykinine under control. 

 

Feather Spark: ""Bradykinine makes blood vessels leak.  We have good reason to believe that we see exactly this effect with this Covid-19 infection.  ACE2 receptors disappear because of the virus, giving bradykinine free rein and the small blood vessels start leaking massively at the site of infection"".



This may well be crucial in the treatment of corona patients.  After all, there are ways to inhibit the action of bradykinine. 

 

The Radboudumc will now investigate this, together with, among others, the UMC in Utrecht.  We are in the process of setting up our first treatments,"" says Van de Veerdonk.  For every good idea must first of all be proven"".

I'll be fascinated to see how this ends up being implemented, it looks like they'll be using unique identifiers rather than any actual identity info but idk how you'd make that work when people are using different apps. It doesn't seem like they intend to build the apps themselves, only the underlying APIs.

They need to be very careful not to fuck this up, because governments using this for anything besides pandemics would be a fucking disaster.

I really hope they both implement rules so only apps that are explicitly built for contact tracing are able to use the new APIs. If Facebook tries to get in on this shit I'll burn it to the ground.

IFR is the infection fatality rate, which includes everyone who was infected.

CFR > IFR because CFR has a smaller denominator.

Secondly, we have a partial immunity to the flu due to vaccinations and previous infections. That dramatically reduces the infection rate.

The curve is only dipped because of social distancing. The majority of Americans will have not had the virus, and there is no herd immunity as a result.

So what's after social distancing? The reality is that there is legitimately no plan. Like no one has a plan, there are multiple thinktanks developing plans, some of the involve working for a week, then a week a social distancing, some of them call for splitting who's allowed to work for each day by your last name, etc.

In any case, there's a pretty good chance college, which *can* be done online, induces mass domestic and international migration, crams a bunch of people into dorms, dining halls, and lecture halls, will not be part of the plan after we're done. 

It's safer to just do it online until we have a vaccine, and it actually helps the rest of the workforce start up again.

2020-04-10,Famous_Variety,wallstreetbets,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyk7m6/us_lockdown_likely_to_be_extended_based_around/fn0d1ni/,"New federal projections show a spike in infections if shelter in place orders are lifted at 30 days.

Stay-at-home orders, school closures and social distancing greatly reduce infections of the coronavirus, but lifting those restrictions after just 30 days will lead to a dramatic infection spike this summer and death tolls that would rival doing nothing, government projections indicate.

The projections obtained by The New York Times come from the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. The models use three scenarios. The first has policy makers doing nothing to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. The second, labeled “steady state,” assumes schools remain closed until summer, 25 percent of Americans telework from home, and some social distancing continues. The third scenario includes a 30-day shelter in place, on top of those “steady state” restrictions.

The documents, dated April 9, contain no dates for when shelter in places orders were delivered nor do they contain specific dates for when spikes would hit. The risk they show of easing shelter-in-place orders currently in effect in most of the country undercut recent statements by President Trump that the United States could be ready to reopen “very, very soon.”

The model forsees a bump in the demand for ventilators — considered a stand-in for serious Covid-19 infection rates — 30 days after stay-at-home orders are issued, a major spike in infections about 100 days after, and peaking 150 days after the initial order. (Assuming further shelter-in-place policies are not implemented to reduce future peaks.)

For most states that implemented stay-at-home orders in late March, including New York City, Massachusetts and Illinois, that spike would come in mid to late summer.

The government’s conclusions are sobering. Without any mitigation, such as school closings, shelter-in-place orders, telework and socially distancing, the death toll from coronavirus could have reached 300,000. But if the administration lifts the 30-day stay-at-home orders, the death total is estimated to reach 200,000, even if schools remain closed until summer, 25 percent of the country continues to work from home and some social distancing continues.

If nothing was done, infection rates would top out at 195 million Americans, and 965,000 people would require hospitalization in an intensive care unit, according to the projections’ “best guess.” But with a 30-day shelter in place and other measures, infections would still reach 160 million and 740,000 would need intensive care.

The models show a higher demand for ventilators in the short term if states had never issued the stay-at-home orders. But the spike in demand 150 days after lifting such an order is expected to be more severe than if the United States had never issued such orders and instead relied on school closures, sending people home to telework and directing the public to socially distance.

The federal agencies advised in the model that the projected demand for ventilators are “a worst-case scenario” and did not factor in states sharing the life-saving devices across state lines.

Mr. Trump has teased the idea of reopening the United States to boost the economy, even as state governors, hospitals around the country and the federal government’s inspector general for Health and Human Services have warned of widespread shortages of test kits, protective gear and medical equipment.

“You see what’s happening and where we are and where we stand,” Mr. Trump said. “And hopefully we’re going to be opening up — you can call it “opening” very, very — very, very soon, I hope.”

But economists say that lifting restrictions — particularly on nonessential businesses — will restore some activity to an economy that is currently in free fall, shedding jobs and contracting rapidly.

Many experts caution that growth will be slow when it returns, because people will be wary of resuming normal activities before the country has far more extensive testing for the virus to help people assess the risk of contracting it if they leave their homes. Such a system appears nowhere close to deployment."

California has been on state-wide shelter in place since 3/19, with partial shutdowns starting at least one week prior (SF Bay Area 3/16 shutdown order). It is important to note that many schools across the state had moved online by 3/13, and many companies already had workers who were able to work from home doing so before statewide shelter in place orders came in. The governor had also closed nightclubs, bars, etc and urged vulnerable populations to stay home prior to the statewide shutdown.

Mayor De Blasio was urging a shelter in place order around the same time as CA was doing this. Article [dated 3/18 with Governor Cuomo](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ny-gov-cuomo-says-no-new-york-city-s-shelter-n1162911) being a dingus. [Two days later](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-20200320-hiya77j3w5brjbt7lbkrvcmeve-story.html) he declared shelter in place. To my understanding schools were not moved online until this 3/20 day, at least in NYC.

By the numbers.  
CA Population: 37M  
NY Population 20M

So, CA has roughly twice the number. How were cases looking, if we separate out a few weeks? All numbers are cumulative.

3/13:  
CA: 301 cases, 5 deaths  
NY:  423 cases, 0 deaths

3/20:  
CA: 1264 cases, 24 deaths  
NY: 8530 cases, 56 deaths

3/27:  
CA: 4901 cases, 102 deaths  
NY: 46124 cases, 596 deaths

4/3:  
CA: 12,567 cases, 281 deaths  
NY: 103,158 cases, 2971 deaths.

And if the reality is our natural immunity for this thing sucks (and that seems to be the case), capacity is getting strained (we saw this in other places ahead of our lockdowns).

The follow-up problem is that you start having deaths because of the existence of coronavirus but not because of it because now people are being turned away from other problems - either because the resource is now in use and would normally be available, or it is too dangerous (cancer treatments for instance.)  In the US 0.37% is 1M dead if it hypothetically infected everyone.  The hospitalization rate is much higher and then people that can be saved need to be turned away.  How many more die from it or because of it because of the increased load?

On the other side, you also can't ignore that people die because of bad economy as well.  It's extremely complicated.  Unfortunately, we cannot have these discussions honestly because it's politically awful to give these kind of messages.

Frankly, I've thought for years that our philosophy of working while sick was incredibly stupid and if we stop being stupid about stuff like that maybe we save lives, and jobs, in the long run by being smarter about how we approach infection.

They win most of the time, and they win most of the time without putting any effort in themselves. 

They could kill the CFL by putting one team in Canada but opt not too, and still get nearly 10 million Canadians watching the Superbowl while only 3 or 4 million watch their own version of it (the Grey Cup). 

They have no real competition from other American sports leagues, easily ruling broadcast ratings over all other events, sports or no sports. 

They survive scandals, presidents ranting against them, doctors proving football leads to CTE, and at times outrageous referee mistakes. 

Start up football leagues fold and die without the NFL even sweating of competition. (I saw social media for the XFL. There were plenty of people clamoring the league was better than the NFL for their refs and innovations and all that) 

They have the OTA broadcasters in their clutches and are basically keeping those networks alive, hence, will demand record breaking fees to keep it going. 

They have all the elite tech companies clamoring for a piece of the broadcasting pie, from Google, Apple, and Amazon.

They don't pay a dime to develop their players. The NCAA does it for them! 

An event where GMs sitting in their homes will call out names of future players will be the highest rated sports event this year behind the Superbowl, because no other sports can be on.

The coronavirus pandemic hurt the other sports all around the world but the NFL managed to get a Superbowl off and enter an offseason before it started, and will probably start a new season after the pandemic is over, coming out mostly unscathed. 

It really is something to marvel."

The trend of recoveries exceeding new infection continues, and therefore the amount of clinically diagnosed active cases continues to decline.  We have diagnosed 65 cases in the last 7 days, but 115 cases in the 7 days prior to that.  So not only are the new cases as a percentage of total cases declining, the number of cases per day appears to be declining.  This is good news.

What does this mean for the next few weeks?  Well, unless we get our new case numbers down to zero, we can expect that the active case graph to flatten out - but not quite get to zero.  This seems to be the case for other jurisdictions that have gotten the outbreak under control.  Due to the asymptomatic community spread of Coronavirus, it seems very difficult to get the infections to zero.

We should be proud that we are seeing declining numbers when so many other jurisdictions are not.  The measures we have taken are working.  We need to keep them up to see these trends continue.  It is the long weekend, and for many, a religious time where dinners with extended family, and large group services are the norm.

**APRIL 10, 2020**  
**|4:07 PM**

SAN FRANCISCO —  The first to get sick was a woman in the nurse staffing office, who died in mid-March after a girls’ trip to Las Vegas with some hospital colleagues.  
A nursing manager fell ill next, followed by a nurse on the night shift and then a day supervisor. A short time later, a day shift nurse went out and then a temp.  
At the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, the nurses on a second-floor medical-surgical unit kept the grim tally in furtive texts and emails: Six women who had worked on their ward or visited it in the course of their duties had developed [symptoms of the coronavirus. ](https://archive.fo/o/OSkWO/https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/%23nt=liK0promoLarge-7030col2-main)Four reported testing positive, one had yet to be tested and one was dead.  
Yet from the hospital administration, the worried employees said they heard nothing about what appeared to be an outbreak of the virus within the hospital’s walls. There was no official acknowledgment of the cases, and nurses who shared phone headsets, computer keyboards and a tiny break room were not tested, according to interviews and correspondence reviewed by The Times.  
**ADVERTISEMENT**  
The frustration boiled over this week with an anonymous whistleblower complaint to Santa Clara County, which runs the hospital.  
“Management is not communicating confirmed positive cases — information that would enable potentially-exposed/infected staff to take extra precautionary measures to not affect their loved ones at home and elsewhere,” stated a complaint signed, “employees not treated responsibly from within.”  
The hospital’s compliance office has now launched an investigation.  
A spokesman for the county health system, Maury Kendall, said in a statement that “some of our healthcare workers have tested or will test positive for COVID-19 and are out sick.” He said, though, that administrators were unaware of any deaths in the hospital ranks from the virus and declined to answer specific questions about the administration’s handling of the situation in the 2 Medical ward.  
“We cannot comment on pending investigations, or on personnel matters, except to say that we dispute the allegations presented,” Kendall said.  
Silicon Valley has been one of the [hardest-hit parts of California](https://archive.fo/o/OSkWO/https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/%23nt=liK0promoLarge-7030col2-main) with Santa Clara County reporting more than 1,440 confirmed cases and 47 deaths. Of the confirmed cases, 109 have been healthcare workers, according to state data. Valley Medical Center, the region’s flagship public hospital, has cared for a wave of COVID-19 patients.  
The 2 Medical unit was not a designated ward for coronavirus patients, but nurses were trained in infection protocols for virus patients and some with suspected or confirmed cases ended up receiving treatment there.  
The staffer who died, who was the first known widely to have symptoms, worked on another floor of the hospital, but she had frequent contact with the unit staff as part of her job, according to interviews with four employees, the whistleblower report and a written complaint to the president of the nurses’ union. The employees spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they feared retaliation.  
The 50-year-old woman was a close friend of a unit nurse on the night shift, and the pair had gone with other colleagues to Las Vegas in the middle of March, co-workers said. The trip occurred after local officials, alarmed about coronavirus cases cropping up in the community, had urged residents to stay home when they were sick and warned against nonessential travel.  
Shortly after the staffer came back from Nevada, she developed symptoms of the virus and was admitted to a Kaiser Permanente hospital.  
Her death March 19 stunned many in the hospital, including on 2 Medical.  
“I was on my shift and I got a text message and I was like, ‘Oh, my God! \[The staffer\] died,’” a nurse recalled.  
The staffer’s husband did not return messages seeking comment, but a nurse who is in contact with her family said the woman was suspected of having COVID-19 and was in an isolation unit when she died.  
Her colleagues put up fliers summoning co-workers to a short memorial service at the hospital and her friends encouraged donations to a charity she supported, but there was no official communication to the nursing staff, according to the whistleblower complaint and interviews.  
Within a few days of the staffer falling ill, the nurse manager of 2 Medical had a fever and went on sick leave. She later told her nurses in an email that she had tested positive, according to interviews and the complaints to the whistleblower and the union.  
In the same period, a night shift nurse who had cared for a patient suspected of having COVID-19 started experiencing body aches and chills and later a fever. She called in sick and went to see her primary care doctor, who tested her for the virus, according to a union representative she consulted. In late March, the results came back positive, the representative said.  
A manager told her that the suspected patient had tested negative, the union representative said. “She was told, ‘You contracted it in the community … you didn’t get it from the patient.”  
Her father, with whom she lived, also got the virus and is now in an intensive care unit, the union representative said.  
By then, nurses on 2 Medical had grown worried. There was no way to stay 6 feet from each other at the nurse’s station. At meals, the staff — sans masks — sat close to one another around a small table. The work was often communal as well.  
“If we need help putting a Foley catheter, how are we supposed to do social distancing if the other nurse is holding the patient’s leg?” one nurse said.  
The spokesman for the county hospital system said there are “robust cleaning processes” in place and that “our healthcare workers must practice social distancing at work where possible, including in the break rooms, meeting rooms, and other locations. “  
On the weekend of March 21, an assistant manager on the unit called in sick, but she opted to return to work on Monday while still feeling poorly, according to interviews and the complaints.  
As described in the whistleblower complaint, the assistant manager “made her own determination and communicated to others in management that the unit ‘needed her help’ and subsequently returned to active work...in spite of continued symptoms.”  
Over the next week, the assistant manager worked a half-dozen shifts. She continued feeling ill and ultimately tested positive earlier this month, according to whistleblower and the union complaints."

This isn't 'fear mongering' or whatever word you want to use to describe it. My community is important to me. So is the state I live in. I want to protect it and the people that live there. The fact that so many medical experts, professionals, and any other person specialized in infectious diseases would tell you that this is the reality of the situation. They are taking almost the exact measures we have been, bar some other differences. However, by ignoring the problem, it will continue to get worse."

A high LSAT alone does a less to differentiate you from other applicants, so softs/GPA are way more important.

I'm less certain of this but there are some people who say a bunch of people deferred from last year to this year which means there were fewer seats to begin with.

Deferrals may be worse next year because Coronavirus, people might be sitting out and reapplying bc they are scared of online 1L, and the LSAT-Flex may pump out some high scores that hit next cycle. I think next cycle will be worse."

De modo que sugirió que se continuara con la vida normal pese al Coronavirus. Aunque tiene razón en que el daño económico será muy grande, sus ""buenas intenciones"" y aparente preocupación por los mexicanos son bastante cuestionables.

Primero, él [menciona una preocupación por los más necesitados](https://twitter.com/RicardoBSalinas/status/1247630583351726080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1247630584291168256&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvanguardia.com.mx%2Farticulo%2Fcoronavirus-empleados-de-salinas-pliego-se-quejan-de-condiciones-laborales-nos-obligan), reconociendo que será casi imposible pasar más de un mes sin trabajo ni sustento.

Y durante esta emergencia él se ha negado a cerrar sus sucursales y a concederles a sus empleados días feriados durante la contingencia sanitaria (y él es un hombre listo. Él sabe perfectamente bien lo infeccioso que es este virus). Simplemente él ve a su personal como desechable y reemplazable, y esta falsa preocupación por la economía mexicana es solo para disfrazar su preocupación a perder ingresos.

Recientemente sugirió la brillantísima idea de [aislar a los ancianos en sus casas mientras que los jóvenes salen a trabajar como si nada](https://twitter.com/RicardoBSalinas/status/1247630584291168256).

[How Trump turned ventilators into a form of patronage](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21215578/trump-ventilators-coronavirus-cory-gardner-colorado-jared-polis-patronage)


 Trump said states need to get supplies on their own, so the governor of Colorado reached a deal with a private company for 500 ventilators.

Once FEMA got word, it stepped in to prevent that contract from going through so it could acquire the ventilators instead. No explanation given.

Then senator Gardner, **one of the most vulnerable Republican senators up for reelection** , called Trump to request 100 ventilators.

 The President tweeted that night that thanks to Gardner, Colorado would get 100 ventilators from the federal stockpile. 
 
The next day, he again gave credit to Gardner at the daily briefing.

So Colorado is still 400 ventilators short and this senator got publicity for saving the day, but it was the governor who actually secured the vents before they were taken in the first place.

Trump is framing this as a good thing when the reality is the people of Colorado would have been better off without any federal intervention at all."

I think that's pretty common; most of us who have any kind of cold-ish or flu-ish symptoms, or seasonal allergy response, worry we have it these days.

But with him it's always a little extra. He'll feel the throat tickle, take his temperature and it's like...99.3 or something. So a bit of a fever but not really a fever? And then he'll tell me he's sure he has the virus.

I can't not take it seriously because what if this time, it IS coronavirus? And if I'm living with someone who is infected I shouldn't even be going to the grocery store, mask or not. And I've got the weight of having to make sure I can get an Instacart order, turn down any chance to be physically present at our essential workplace, etc. etc. But then the next day he's totally fine.

Even during the Before Time, he was a very suggestible, high-anxiety person who kind of psyched himself into believing he had illnesses. If one of our kids was sick, for instance, he'd ALWAYS ALWAYS say a day or two later, ""I think I caught Child's cold, I can feel it coming on."" But 99 times out of 100, no symptoms would ever appear and he'd actually be fine. It's not LYING - he really does feel sore or achy or whatever - but it's not actual contagion either. So I'm tempted to view his coronavirus moments as an anxiety symptom as well. But...this IS a very contagious disease that is everywhere and it does present mildly in some people, so..."

I know it was basically a meme that idiots were saying coronavirus is just another flu, which is clearly a stupid thing to say at 2% mortality rates, but at a different mortality rate, it sort of is. 

I'm not questioning initial lockdowns, because based on our initial mortality estimates, it was clearly the right thing to do.

Loss is a webcomic (I forget the name of the artist but if you really want to know you can look that up). They usually drew comical/light-hearted comics and one day dropped a very sad comic that was four panels long. 

The first panel was a man entering a building.

The second panel was the man talking to a woman at a reception desk.

The third panel was the man talking to a doctor.

The fourth panel was the man beside the hospital bed of a woman that had passed away.

This comic was titled ""loss"" and is represented in a lot of hidden ways. Usually a 2x2 grid with 1 horizonal line in the first square to represent the man. 2 horiz lines in the second to represent the man & woman. 2 horiz lines in the third to represent the man & doctor. Finally, 1 horiz line and 1 vertical line in the fourth square to represent the man and hospitalized woman.

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

Global Oil Deal Elusive as Saudis Suffer String of Setbacks.       
        
By Grant Smith, Javier Blas, Amy Stillman, and Salma El Wardany.        

April 10, 2020, 6:33 AM MDT.      
       
A global deal to cut oil production and save the market from a coronavirus-induced breakdown proved elusive on Friday as a diplomatic initiative led by Saudi Arabia suffered repeated setbacks.      
        
After two days of talks, it remained unclear whether the kingdom had resolved the differences with Mexico that would allow its agreement for a record 10 million barrel-a-day supply reduction to proceed.      
        
And a meeting of energy ministers from the Group of 20, which the cartel had hoped could add another 5 million barrels a day of cuts, ended with a statement that supported measures to stabilize the market but didn’t commit to any specific supply reductions, according to a draft of the communique.      
       
These diplomatic obstacles cast doubt on efforts to revive the market from a debilitating slump in prices to the lowest in almost two decades, which has exposed governments and companies around the world to severe financial pressure.     
      
It was now up to Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman and U.S. President Donald Trump -- who instigated the whole deal -- to salvage something.    
       
“We are trying to get Mexico, as the expression goes, over the barrel,” Trump said in a White House news conference on Friday.      
       
If the deal can be finalized, the proposed OPEC+ cuts would dwarf any previous market interventions. They would also end the destructive price war between Riyadh and Moscow that’s flooded the market with crude just as demand collapses because of the coronavirus lockdown.        
       
“Even if poorly implemented, the agreement is substantial, and will make a difference to the market,” said Ann-Louise Hittle, vice president of macro oils at consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Partial compliance of the kind that Mexico is demanding “won’t stop this production agreement from having a big -- and swift -- impact on supply and demand fundamentals.”      
        
All but one nation among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies endorsed the production cut equivalent to about 10% of global supply. Mexico insisted that it could only cut by 100,000 barrels a day, not the 400,000 OPEC+ was asking for and blocked passage of Thursday’s deal.     
        
Trump Intervention.      
        
On Friday morning, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he had resolved the matter in a phone call with Trump. The U.S. would make an additional 250,000 barrels a day of cuts on Mexico’s behalf, Lopez Obrador said at a press conference, although it was unclear whether Saudi Arabia had accepted the proposal.       
     
Trump said he had agreed to “help Mexico along” in making a deal with Russia and Saudi Arabia. The U.S. will make up the difference between the 100,000 barrels a day Mexico is able to cut and the 400,000 requested by OPEC+, he said.      
     
Russia appeared satisfied. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that Putin considers the OPEC+ deal to be fully agreed and regards it “very positively.""      
       
OPEC+ has been put under intense pressure to do a deal by Trump and American lawmakers, who fear thousands of job losses in the U.S. shale patch. Yet the American president hasn’t promised to make deliberate production cuts. Instead, he will let market forces do their work, allowing low prices to deliver “automatic” output curbs.       
      
That sentiment was reiterated by his energy secretary Dan Brouillette in opening remarks at Group of 20 meeting on Friday. He predicted a decline of nearly 2 million barrels a day in U.S. output by the end of this year.       
      
G-20 Meeting.     
      
“The extreme volatility we are seeing in oil markets is detrimental to the global economy at a time when we can least afford it,” said Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, who’s been a key figure in the diplomatic effort to broker a global deal.     
      
If Saudi Arabia can overcome the obstacles and lead the world to a 15 million barrel-a-day production cut, it would be an historic achievement. However, it would also be just a fraction of the 20 million to 35 million barrels a day in estimated global demand losses as billions of people stay confined to their homes and businesses close to slow the spread of the coronavirus.     
      
West Texas Intermediate crude plunged more than 9% on Thursday, settling at below $23 a barrel, as traders and analysts said the cut was too small to prevent an oversupply of crude.     
       
“With demand likely down 20% this quarter, we believe the agreed cuts won’t be enough to prevent oil inventories from rising sharply over the coming weeks,” said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Group AG.

He can do whatever he wants, but the next lockdowns will be consumer-driven, not leader-driven.

Below are the relevant rationales for this mostly obvious future, organized with headers.

**Redundancy, naked and exposed.** The virus has already exposed the old economy for what it was: Flawed. Slow. Bloated. Old. Feet-draggingingly Traditional. Physical over digital even in cases where physical shopping or service was no longer necessary. ""Invest in clean coal--for the sake of the old coal economy."" ""Keep buying less-efficient, gas-powered cars even once they become more expensive than electric ones--for the sake of the old oil economy.""

Ours was an economy that seriously encouraged consumers to almost ""philanthropically spend"" at small businesses (""#smallbusinesssaturday!"") that often offer inferior products, and always inferior convenience. That's hard-earned living-month-to-month gig pay for a metric ton of Americans, spent at stores and business that will inevitably fall to the widespread product availability, convenience, and stability of an Amazon, a Target, a Google.

We would've been better off putting the money into GoFundMe's for these small business owners to safely over years and at a comfortable pace train for a more future-proof job.

Our was a weak, dying, delusional economy.

And this is the economy that leaders want to ""reopen.""

**Dead businesses plenty worthy of resurrection:** The services that will still be valuable after the crisis is over (but will never stay open during the crisis), we should rightly try to thread through the coronavirus' bottleneck, supplementing them in the interim. Think, hair salons, movie theaters, bars that predominantly make money off alcohol not food, massage therapists, sporting events of all levels, concerts. All of the relevant businesses and industries will experience a resurgence.

Others will not experience such a resurgence; they were already drowning anyway (Think, retail).

There is value to looking at a business' plan for post-coronavirus courtship of consumers before we issue what are now ""no questions asked"" loans.

For the businesses with only delusional, old-world plans for the future, we should ask them to accept the inevitable: Rather than a bailout, we can and should take that same American tax money and spend it on education and training for those individuals, give them U.B.I. for several years, and train them to embark in industries and ventures that actually have a chance in even the near-future developed-world--a genuine **i**nvestment that will yield big in the long-term.

The coronavirus has accelerated this truth.

But wait; there's more...

**Mixed messaging, continued:** So what is it again that these leaders want to say? Something like, ""We're open again! But oh yeah, totally there is still a new virus that is often asymptotic, has no strong therapeutic as of yet, even with a therapeutic will still be deadly for more of the population than is typical with illnesses, and by the way, we're about a year away from a vaccine that has yet to be proven, manufactured, shipped, distributed, and then administered. And a year *is* accelerating it; normally it would take several...

...But we're open!""

What a strange, old-world, oxymoronic oddity--a remnant of leaders who believe they can compel people to spend, travel, attend events just with some forceful or hopeful words.

***It's like the Grim Reaper trying to convince you to take a ride, but somehow even less convincing.***

They can try. It won't work. Consumers are of all ages, including the dreaded 60+. Consumers have auto-immune diseases. They have heart disease. They have diabetes. They already were underinsured. Now they're also broke, unemployed. They're now realizing they are undereducated with skill sets that will not translate into the future economy whether the coronavirus had hit us or not.

These leaders, they want to jumpstart economies? Deal with the above problems. Anything else is delaying the inevitable. These already were and certainly will have continued to be serious, exponentially growing ""viral"" problems not unlike the virus itself. They're deadly unto themselves. Just ask our black American communities right now.

There is one way that will allow old-world economies to rise temporarily (and then die again within the decade anyway): Rapid, instant testing at every storefront, providing jaded consumers with peace of mind and ""100% Coronavirus-free Shopping.""

Don't hold your breath.

**Conclusions:** This conversation about reopening is utterly moot on arrival. I hope we all stop wasting our time on it: Consumers will not leave their houses in any substantial way that looks like a re-opening until vaccines are in every upper arm around. Until then, (1) embrace the opportunity to consider the future, and in turn (2)  with evidence and foresight aim to future-proof our society consciously and intelligently.

Because we've never cared enough, for long enough, to make one.  The coronaviruses that are bad enough to spur efforts to make a vaccine, have all faded down to nearly nothing within several months.  Once it's no longer a major public concern, funding dries up and efforts to make a vaccine are abandoned.  For the coronaviruses that do stick around longer, they're always of the common cold variety and nobody cares enough to bother.

This is the first time we've had something scary enough and persistent enough to push vaccine development to its conclusion.  We'll get one this time around.  It'll take them bare minimum a year, probably closer to two, but they'll make one."

I am so sick and tired of you shameless people politicizing Dr. Li for your own nefarious ideological goals. The Dr. Li Wenliang situation is shitty, but he was punished according to the law, and it was not the kind of malevolent crack down that you believe it to be. Afterwards his reprimand was vacated, and he has been elevated to martyr status in China. 

I am about to debunk your whole life, so strap in:

------


[Chinese Human Rights Defenders](https://www.nchrd.org/2020/01/china-protect-human-rights-while-combatting-coronavirus-outbreak/), (an independent, unbiased Hong Kong based human rights group) records Dr. Li Wenliang as having been punished for saying the following:

 >“X医院已有多例SARS确诊病例”; “确诊了7例SARS”; “Y医院接收了一家三口从某洲回来的，然后就疑似非典了”

Translated, this means: X hospital already has many confirmed SARS patients; 7 SARS patients have been confirmed; Y hospital has already accepted a family of 3 patients, and suspects they have SARS” 

Notice how Dr. Li Wenliang calls the virus SARS. We know that this was not exactly right. Dr. Li called it SARS because he was actually acting upon an erroneous report from Bo’Ao Medical. Lab. Co. [See [here](https://perma.cc/H9BF-X4W5), at p.5] which falsely identified the virus as SARS. 

Why does that matter? Well China has criminalized the dissemination of false information as it relates to an epidemic (think of it similar to how America prohibits false bomb/terrorist reports). The relevant provision can be found at [Article 291-1 of China’s criminal law](https://www.66law.cn/tiaoli/9.aspx): 
>“Whoever fabricates any false dangerous situation, **epidemic situation**, disaster situation or police situation, spreads it on the information network or other media, or knowingly spreads it on the information network or other media, thus seriously disturbing the social order, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or public surveillance.” 


The punishment guidelines for this offense iare detailed in in [Article 25 of China’s Public Security Management Punishment Law](http://www.gov.cn/flfg/2005-08/29/content_27130.htm): 
>“Whoever commits one of the following acts shall be detained for not less than five days but not more than 10 days and may also be fined not more than 500 yuan; if the circumstances are relatively minor, he shall be detained for not more than five days or fined not more than 500 yuan:

>（1）**Spreading rumors, falsely reporting danger, epidemic situation,** police situation or deliberately disturbing public order by other means;


>（2）...


>（3）...

So we can see from China's law, the police officers at the time considered Dr. Li's circumstances to be minor, and they only gave him a [reprimand](https://i.imgur.com/fSSPSgb.png) instead of recommended sentence of 5-10 days. 

So, what's the real story of Dr. Li Wenliang? 

1. Dr. Li's hospital gets a false report from Bo'Ao Med. Lab. Co. saying that the patient was infected with SARS. 

2. Dr. Li, acting in good faith upon that information, notifies his colleagues about the danger. 

3. Dr. Li's words get leaked to public, and the possibility of a new SARS outbreak causes a minor public panic. 

4. The police begin investigating, and call up local authorities and hospitals and ask about SARS outbreak. Everyone tells the police there is no SARS outbreak, so police think that Dr. Li made it up. 

5. Police then reprimand Dr. Li, thinking that he willingly spread some false information. Because they only gave him reprimand, we can infer that the police were understanding of his situation and expressed leniency. 

6. Dr. Li goes back to work and continues to fight against COVID-19. He eventually succumbs to the disease, but he is a hero for putting his life before others. 

7. Subsequent investigation reveals Dr. Li was acting in good faith, because of the erroneous report from Bo'Ao Med. Lab. Co. Therefore, he fails the 'intentionality' requirement of Article 291-1 of China's criminal law, and the reprimand is found to be invalid. Therefore, his reprimand is vacated. 


This is the true story of Dr. Li Wenliang, complete with citations. Now please stop spreading misinformation about this hero. Dr. Li should not be used as a political tool."

>Probably to some extent, though the first batch of studies is far from conclusive as to how long it lasts. Provisional research from Germany has suggested that COVID-19 infectiousness – in contrast to the 2003 SARS outbreak – peaks early and that recovering patients with mild symptoms become low-risk around 10 days after they first fall ill. But another study, following four medical professionals treated at a Wuhan hospital, revealed that traces of the virus could persist in the body for up to two weeks after symptoms had vanished; as the patients were no longer coughing or sneezing, the potential means of transmission were albeit much reduced. Less optimistic was a study published last week in The Lancet medical journal that showed the virus survived in one Chinese patient’s respiratory tract for 37 days – well above the average of 24 days for those with critical disease status.

By choosing to make communism the scapegoat for the virus, and in a political climate where more and more people are becoming increasingly aggravated with the way the US is dealing with all this, this is likely to start to enlighten people that communism is not some evil magical force. 

The Coronavirus shitshow in the US obviously has nothing to do with communism. Even the dimmest of people will eventually see this, and this fiasco easier to explain and understand than it is to explain the past. Instead of trying to explain how US foreign policy fucked shit up, among other things, all we got to do is point at the doctors wearing trash bags and the middle class losing everything.

As in, you want to know whether or not people have it, so you can put them in areas of the hospital where likely coronavirus or confirmed coronavirus cases can be isolated, in order to prevent spread to non-infected people. So in this case they'll likely have tested him so they know which part of the hospital to care for him in. 

Not sure what policy they're specifically using at this hospital, but at mine we have split our A&E into a 'hot' A&E for any potential coronavirus patients, and a 'cold' A&E for those who are not likely to have coronavirus, based on a consultant triage at the door. Hospitals across the country are using similar polices. As well as the respiratory symptoms we all know about, and fever, you qualify as hot if you are a care home resident, have any chest pain, any infectious GI symptoms, or are 'generally unwell' (i.e. flu-like). Once you're in the 'hot' A&E if you're being admitted to hospital you will get tested for coronavirus, as you've now become 'hot' from exposure (even if you weren't before).

It says in this article that Dalglish is being treated for an infection that isn't coronavirus, so he likely had a fever or had some features of being 'generally unwell' - which meant he was considered 'hot', and despite not being thought to have coronavirus, got tested for it.

I do think it's interesting they say he's asymptomatic of coronavirus though - as having a fever and being 'generally unwell' are features of any infection, including coronavirus, and if he's requiring IV antibiotics he's very likely to have these symptoms. It might well be that by 'asymptomatic of coronavirus' they mean that they're not attributing the symptoms to coronavirus as they have another source of infection (e.g. a UTI) which they think is the more likely cause.

Of course I'm speculating a bit here, but it's a reasonably educated guess."

Yeah I do have a website for them, and make/sell them, but right now my workshop is shut down thanks to coronavirus & quarantine. For anyone who did want one, they'd need to understand that it will be sometime before they actually receive it.

As for the process-- I design the maps in software, then use a lasercutter to cut/engrave the wood. Then it's all handwork-- sanding, staining, coloring, etc. Some complicated ones can take 8+ hours, Ann Arbor was relatively simple though so it only took about 2-3 hours.

Yea the pre-existing conditions thing you mentioned is an issue too, but MOST disease deaths aren’t from the virus itself (even “flu deaths”) but are actually from already-sick people getting the virus and that virus being the straw that breaks the camels back. Hell even  KNOWN COVID deaths - COVID often doesn’t directly kill you, but it tears up your lungs and then other infections start up, give you pneumonia, and kill you

Think of it like AIDS. AIDS rarely kills anyone, but it fucks with their immune system and then some other virus/germ infected them and kills them.

Like say you had a bad liver. You’re doing bad, but otherwise you’re healthy and stable for the time being and will be for awhile. Then BOOM you get COVID and all your hormone levels, body temp, and everything else starts going way out of whack because you’re sick. The stress on your body kills you because your already-defunct liver shuts down completely due to your health being stable.

Technically you died of a bad liver, but you weren’t going to until COVID kicked you over that bad liver ledge"

>The pandemic crisis now rests on a fulcrum. On one side is Covid-19  and every possible action that might prevent people from contracting and  dying from infection. On the other side is everything else that  matters: livelihoods that allow people to feed and shelter their  families; civil liberties; the education of children; social well-being,  including the prevention of loneliness, isolation and domestic  violence; and all other medical conditions, from cancer and heart  disease to dental emergencies. The belief that it is worth sacrificing  anything and everything at the altar of flattening the coronavirus curve  is foolish. But many leaders are behaving that way. We need a clearer  picture of all that is at stake before those at the helm burn down the  village to save it.

&#x200B;

>Examples of bad actions, often by  well-intentioned leaders, are proliferating. The mayor of Chicago warned  joggers that a stay-at-home order means they may not go on long runs  without risking arrest, a flagrant disregard for the American values of  liberty and prudence, not to mention the common-sense benefits of  exercise. A city in Texas threatens to fine residents up to $1,000 if  they (and their children) don’t wear masks in public. New Jersey Gov.  Phil Murphy recommends a policy of social distancing within your own  household. “Keep your distance between yourself and other family  members,” he cautioned recently. More broadly, governors have ordered  shutdowns to slow the coronavirus without acknowledging what these  shutdowns cost.

&#x200B;

>Encouragingly, this has also been a time of extraordinary  action by private citizens. The largest volunteer network in New York,  New York Cares, decided that instead of closing up shop, it will press  on to serve the community. Grocery stores have created special shopping  hours for seniors and health-care workers. The New England Patriots used  its team plane to fly a million N95 masks from China to Boston. The  list of courageous acts is lengthy.

&#x200B;

>To help set the right course for our country, we must grasp  some simple—but tough—facts. The novel coronavirus is highly contagious  and tragically lethal to many. There is no guarantee of a vaccine within  the next 18 months. We have taken measures to slow the virus, but these  can’t stop it. The only thing that can stop the virus at this advanced  stage of community transmission is a complete lockdown, which can happen  in authoritarian countries like China, but not in the U.S.

&#x200B;

>Are shutdowns enough? No. Despite the efforts, there is still  enough human contact to ensure the virus will spread. Take a look at the  [long list](https://covid19.ca.gov/img/EssentialCriticalInfrastructureWorkers.pdf?mod=article_inline)  of “essential” services and exemptions on California’s Covid-19  website, for example. Shutdowns will cause the virus to spread more  slowly, but it will spread nonetheless.

&#x200B;

>When shutdowns end, the virus will spread and Covid-19 deaths  will increase. Without a vaccine and community immunity—often called  “herd immunity”—this outcome is all but guaranteed. The only thing that  will temporarily quell it in the near term, short of a miracle  treatment, is another shutdown. But states will get only one pass at  this. Once lifted, the appetite for a repeat shutdown will be tepid at  best, even in left-leaning states. The reality of the shutdown’s  costs—the upheaval caused by school closures, economic hurt, social  isolation and lost lives and livelihoods—will be fresh. Some argue that  stopping Covid-19 and protecting the economy are one and the same.  Although this is true, it is too late to do either.

&#x200B;

>Accepting this reality will help us make better decisions. The  modeling predicts that the number of sick patients is likely to be  profound and exceed anything seen in generations. It’s therefore clear  that building health-care capacity—adding hospital beds, converting and  building coronavirus-only treatment facilities and sourcing  ventilators—is the right step to take.

&#x200B;

>Embracing reality also makes other things clear. If we can’t  shut down for 18 months on the gamble that an effective vaccine will  arrive, how long will it be worth committing millions of families to  poverty and uprooting lives, education and every other part of the  economy? Politicians have largely dodged this question.

&#x200B;

>Already, ethicists are helping us think about how to allocate  ventilators when hospitals run short. And how many older doctors and  nurses have to die before we seriously discuss allowing older  health-care workers—say, above 59—to opt out of dangerous settings like  emergency departments and hospital wards? My experience caring for  patients with suspected or diagnosed Covid-19 infections at UCLA has  made it clear to me that treating them in the same setting as patients  with other diagnoses is unsafe, even with personal protective equipment.

&#x200B;

>Many difficult decisions lie ahead. We stand the best chance of  making good decisions if we consider everything at stake, and not only  the singular goal of reducing Covid-19 deaths.

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

His state was an initial epicenter, but there are signs the curve is flattening, which means Inslee both has extensive experience of how federal failures hampered the response and is already contemplating what comes next.
In an interview, Inslee, a Democrat, shared fresh details on how President Trump’s lack of “urgency” is directly contributing to equipment shortages hobbling response efforts — and hinted at an alarming scenario ahead.
We could use a stronger voice out of the White House to mobilize this nation,” Inslee told me. “We need a giant leap for mankind now, not just small steps.”
Inslee discussed difficulties in procuring equipment that are inexplicable and infuriating. As dogged reporting has shown, the federal government’s handling of medical supply chains has left states and health-care providers scrambling in a state of confusion and without badly needed supplies.
Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic

As many experts have noted — and as Inslee reiterated — this is in part a direct outgrowth of Trump’s failure to fully deploy the Defense Production Act to marshal private sector resources.
The inability to procure needed supplies for testing remains a major problem for Washington state, Inslee noted, but the specifics of why this is the case are notable.
One major problem is that the federal government’s haphazard approach has created a vast mismatch in availability among disparate parts needed to make testing possible.
For instance, Inslee noted, the state has unused testing capacity right now in large part because it lacks one thing: the swabs needed to take samples.
“It seems ridiculous that the United States can’t produce enough swabs to solve this problem,” Inslee told me. “I have 50 or 60 long-term care facilities that have infections in them that we literally have not been able to do the testing we want of remaining residents and staff.”
Inslee said his state might have finally found a supplier to meet this need — for now — but he added that the shortage of another part (such as vials) will surely become a problem in the very near term.

The overarching issue, Inslee told me, is “an inadequate supply chain” that’s “grossly inadequate to the demand.”
A month of lost time
Inslee said this problem is directly traceable to “at least a month” of lost time, because “the president was downplaying this problem and had not engaged the full force of the federal government.”
“We should have been a month ahead on the supply chain compared to where we are,” Inslee said.
In another unsettling example, Inslee noted that he recently asked the CEO of a private company that is manufacturing the transport medium for tests if it could ramp up production with double shifts.
“She said, ‘Well, maybe — we have to find a way to finance that,’” Inslee told me. This surprised him, because it seems like something the federal government should already be communicating with such manufacturers about.

I would have thought the federal government would have talked to every single manufacturer in the nation who either makes this, or could make this, by this point, and said, ‘Look, we’re going to finance a double shift,’” Inslee told me. “That hasn’t happened.”
These problems appear to flow directly from a kind of schizophrenic approach adopted by the federal government. Trump initially told states they were mostly on their own, which led to a bidding war among states seeking supplies from a range of manufacturers and suppliers. Now the feds have sought to exert control over distribution, but it appears piecemeal and partial.
In Inslee’s telling, this has resulted in a double whammy: a shortage of supplies and a lack of coordination of availability of parts. This could be mitigated by a much more robust and coordinated response via the Defense Production Act.
“We still haven’t had the federal government use all its resources to really mobilize the full force of the manufacturing base of the United States,” Inslee told me.

An ominous warning
Along these lines, Inslee warned of another looming problem.
As coronavirus cases recede in the coming months, if anything, more testing will be required. That’s because when people reassemble, it will be urgent to jump on cases in which people again show symptoms, and test them, to avoid a second wave.
“As we want to reopen our schools, as we want to reopen our industries, the amount of testing we need will actually increase,” Inslee said. “In the second wave, we have to have testing, a resource base, and a contact-tracing base that is so much more scaled up than right now. It’s an enormous challenge.”

Inslee stressed that many federal government officials are working very hard and that in many cases, needed equipment has been delivered, for which he is thankful. But he reiterated his call for Trump to exercise “urgency to really mobilize this whole industrial supply chain.”
The Opinions section is looking for stories of how the coronavirus has affected people of all walks of life. Write to us.

“What we need now, what won World War II, was a quartermaster,” Inslee said. “That’s how you win wars. That’s what we need — a quartermaster.”
Recently, Trump was directly confronted with glaring evidence of this. His own administration released a reportdocumenting urgent shortages faced by hospital administrators around the country, who offered constructive suggestions on how the federal government can help save American lives.

In response, Trump lashed out in a rage, and pretended those problems are simply nonexistent.
Needless to say, that’s not the quartermaster we need"

As the virus spreads, it also mutates, much like the way words change in a game of Telephone. By sequencing the virus’s genome from different individual samples, researchers can track strains of coronavirus back to its origins. They have been continually updating their findings on Nextstrain.

The *a priori* branch of conspiracies posit that the people you don’t like must be doing something evil, because they’re the people you don’t like. They’re created without a clear goal or logical conclusion, and and often end up in wild directions, pulling in other unrelated groups that other people don’t like. Examples include Pizzagate, Birtherism, and the entire subgroup of Government Mind Control conspiracy theories, like Chemtrails, Fluoride, and Flat Earth.

The *a posteriori* branch relies on the presupposition that nothing bad ever naturally occurs. It proposes that bad things only happen because some evil group are intentionally causing them to. They have a much more restricted scope and generally focus more on the mechanics of or reasons behind the conspiracy, rather than constantly expanding their scope to include more actors or evil deeds. Examples include 5G/Coronavirus conspiracy theories, Trutherism, and Sandy Hook theories.

And of course, there’s a huge intersection between the two, where you start making things up about groups you don’t like, and then once they seem powerful and scary enough, you start attributing bad events to their doing. (And Vice versa.) This is where the Illuminati, the New World Order, and the Great Replacement theory are found."

Researchers at Radboud Hospital in Nijmegen think they have discovered an essential mechanism in the covid-19 disease process that has been overlooked so far.

 ""If the insight is correct, it probably has important consequences for the treatment of the disease,"" says a press statement from the hospital.

 **Leaky blood vessels**

 Doctors always see three stages of serious infections with the coronavirus: shortness of breath due to fluid on the lungs, an inflammatory reaction in the lungs and the development of thrombosis and scarring in the lungs due to the fluid.

 ""The first phase, in which the lungs fill up with fluid, CT scans of the lungs look serious and patients quickly become short of breath when administering fluid, is very characteristic,"" says Frank van de Veerdonk, internist-infectiologist at Radboud university medical center.  ""This picture cannot be explained only by the infection of the lungs. We had the idea that during this process the very small blood vessels in the lungs also leak. That leakage causes problems for the lungs, because they partly fill up.""

 This was previously seen with SARS, the virus infection that claimed many lives in 2003.  However, a good explanation was never found.

 **Possible leakage explanation**

 The researchers at Radboud university medical center now come up with a possible explanation for the leak.  Covid-19 is known to enter the lungs through the so-called ACE2 receptor.  ACE2 is an enzyme found on organs, including the lungs.  It is also the receptor, the 'receiver', for the coronavirus in the human body.

 ""The virus binds to the receptor and is withdrawn by the receptor into the lung cell, where the virus can multiply,"" says Van de Veerdonk.  ""In a massive infection, those ACE2 receptors disappear from the outside of the cell. Their function also disappears.""

 Until now, doctors have known that ACE2 plays a role in maintaining blood pressure throughout the body.  But it has another function, according to the researchers, which has been left out of the picture in covid-19 infections.  ""ACE2 keeps the substance bradykinin under control. Bradykinin makes blood vessels leak. We have good reason to believe that with these covid-19 infections we see exactly this effect: ACE2 receptors disappear from the lung cells by the introduction of the virus  , which gives bradykinin free rein and causes the small blood vessels to leak en masse at the site of infection. ""

 **Therapy**

 The researchers believe that this is an essential mechanism in the disease process of Covid-19.  While most covid-19 treatments are now aimed at inhibiting inflammation, this research focuses on the phase before that: the leak that is causing the lungs to get into trouble.

 That is why the researchers are already setting up treatments with icatibant, a drug that can inhibit the effects of bradykinin.  ""The beauty is: every patient is the same,"" says Van de Veerdonk.  ""They all have no defenses and everyone is leaking. We have now started the treatment with five patients and I can be cautiously positive. But of course we are not there yet.""

 International research must show whether the new insights and treatments do indeed have an effect.  If that is the case, then this has major consequences, according to Van de Veerdonk.  ""The moment a patient enters the hospital, the whole process can be stopped within a few days and they will have an opportunity to clear the virus in the next two weeks. People can go home faster and because we asked  patients no longer end up in intensive care. ""

 The researchers' new insights have yet to be assessed and commented by colleagues.  Van de Veerdonk chose to publish the research as soon as possible and not wait for publication in a highly regarded magazine.  ""Because if what we think is right, it can make all the difference."""

Unfortunately for you I do.

The study literally says that this is only relevant for a city on full lock-down for the duration of the pandemic, maintaining extremely rigid social distancing and interaction rules. 

The 12K cases they tested all stem from a single event, a carnival held in February. Germany being Germany, they instituted a hard-core lockdown in the region, which Germans being Germans the population stuck to before, during, and after the study.

They tested 1,000 households and found most of them were not infected, due again to rigid, rapid lock-down being put in place.

The study directly links the low mortality rate to this response, and its conclusion specifically says that the numbers will be significantly higher if the population is not locked down.

You on the other hand are just using that single number to claim that coronavirus lock-downs are an overreaction and the risk is overstated, i.e. your point DIRECTLY contradicts the main point of the study."

This finding barely registers as statistically significant with a p-value of 0.02 (and some proponents of stricter p-values of <0.01  instead of 0.05 would say that's not even significant).

If true, I'm not sure this is a specific effect of the virus vs. a quality of someone being ""really, really sick."" Hopefully more data like this comes out. I'm a believer in the pulmonary microthrombi theory, so I could certainly be led to believe CVAs also happen."

First, they had a vaccine ready later that same year.  That strain of flu was new and not included in the previous vaccine, but since it is an influenza they were able to include it in the next season's without all the same trials and stuff we're waiting on now.

It was also slower to transmit.  It was a pretty aggressive flu, but not like this coronavirus.

With this disease, nobody has any immunity at all.  They're shedding the virus well before becoming symptomatic, and some people never become symptomatic at all.  It makes it impossible to control without truly comprehensive testing.

I'm sure when this is over some people will say we overreacted, but if we had no lockdowns and this virus was allowed to spread unchecked throughout the world, it would be an epic disaster.

Anyway, I do remember a bunch of school shutdowns in 2009, both in Texas and California (and other places, too).  There was hand sanitizer everywhere.  I was traveling around with a small group of people and it was on the forefront of our minds.  Before that we were never really concerned with disease, and I went through elementary school, middle school, high school, and college having never heard of a school shutdown because of illness."

https://slate.com/technology/2020/04/coronavirus-circulating-california-2019-bunk.html

Here's some points from the article: 

1) (re: COVID-19 circulating in California in the fall of 2019) “Our research does not suggest that the virus was here that early,” says Lisa Kim of Stanford’s media relations team.

2) The way that viruses mutate also back up that it hasn't been here since the fall. ""There is zero probability [SARS-CoV-2] was circulating in fall 2019,” - Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who has been tracking SARS-CoV-2’s genetic code as it has spread.

3) If California had widespread cases of COVID-19 at any time, we would have seen overwhelmed health care system similar to New York.

4) The person from Stanford quoted in the widely circulating story is a military historian affiliated with Stanford's conservative think tank, The Hoover Institution. They have reason to amplify stories that will get the economy moving sooner by convincing Americans that we are already immune to the virus.

5) This person also writes op-eds for the National Review and Fox News that target Chinese nationals as the source of the virus in California, when most of the cases came from Americans who visited China and came back home to California. This is because the author of those op-eds believes there are too many Chinese nationals in the United States and wants to justify anti-Chinese sentiment."

2.Community competences in Brussels are executed by the Communal community commission and Flemish/French community commission.

3.For some reason the French Community has 2 competent ministers 6+1=7

4.The French community has numerous financing problems so that's why some French community competences where transferred to the Walloon region and the French community commission. ( Accord de la Saint-Quentin). 7+1= 8

First, he is right. the model is fucking garbage. Serious fucking garbage.

Second, it doesn't necessarily matter for at least the short term. Trump is fudging the numbers of deaths, hospitalizations, and intubations in the name of national security. 

Tinfoil hat? I don't think so. Why? New York hospitals were reaching their limits... NY asked Trump to convert Javits Center for additional covid patients. The very same day. Literally the same day that they do that, NY starts reporting unexpectedly low numbers. NY over the course of several days reports lower numbers in all aspects, defying ALL models, even the ROSIEST of ruby glasses pie in the sky fucking bullshit models.

Why?

Because Javits Center is an army run facility and they aren't reporting the numbers. NY can't report the numbers. All they can report is ""wow it's working you guys, everything is going to be better"".

Why? Unrest is firmly entrenched in Italy already. They have been on lockdown for weeks and people are getting stir crazy. New York has had multiple events including a band of kids on bikes that started running wild in the city defying the order, running from cops and doing other minor criminal acts. 

New York is terrified of a riot.

Trump is terrified that if he doesn't keep everything cool and calm and pump the bullshit of ""we have the best tests, we have more tests than anyone, blah blah blah"". He needs to keep people chilled the fuck out because when the reality hits that this is going to last months and people are going to be broke AF and watching wall street zoom up and to the right... Shit is going to hit the fan.

So now, back to ground truth.

I've also been studying this since the end of January. I stocked up on wipes, tp, and paper towels before it was a problem ! :D

My education is in computer science, computer security, and information systems. My background is in information security and cyber intelligence. I primarily work in data engineering and data science in my day job.

I started modeling in February and started trading options on March 2nd, barely in time for the 2nd half of the dive.

Right now, it looks like under 100k deaths in the next 2 months if we keep everything closed and every stays the fuck inside and stays calm. If anything changes, we are fucked. If they open up on May 1, we have 1M dead Americans by the end of May. If they stay open, 2.2M before the end of summer and probably 3M total before we start getting some herd immunity and the virus spreads.

We believe the virus has an r0 of ~5.7-6.0.

Fortunately, because of the composition of America, the high number of work from home jobs, and apparently, the ability for non-morons to stay the fuck put, we think the r0 is under 2.0 after mitigation which is better than many other nations have found even with extreme measures being taken. That's a good thing and a bad thing.

It's good because it means we would do very well if we ride it out and wait for the vaccine before opening. The stock market won't do well, but you know, fuck them.

It's bad because it looks like the problem was overblown. People were talking 2m deaths, then 100-240k, now under 100k? It makes it sound like the virus was overblown and the models were overblown when in reality, Americans have been doing pretty good about mitigation on average. There have been troll farms promoting fake stories of people being stupid during coronavirus. Videos of kids being stupid that were reposted from months before. Why?

Interesting question... Why?

There are many nations who would benefit by a crash in the American economy. Certain nation with sanctions that can't do business w/ America anyway. Certain nations w/ foreign interests greatly conflicting w/ American interests. They beat the war drum to open the economy not because it will save Wallstreet. Wallstreet is fucked either way. They want the country opened so it will kill millions of American citizens and the government will be directly to blame. It will plant the seed of doubt that grows into a plant and they will slav squat and fuck the plant.

It will be the biggest blow in confidence in the American political system that has taken place since they faked the moon landing.

Just kidding about the moon landing.

1.  No beliefs are true. Your own belief system is whatever you want. And you only have to believe in it when you're doing work/magic.

Need a damn good banish? If you can get more of yourself behind an expecto patronum than a classical banishing, use that.

3. Servitors. Creating entities for specific tasks. But when they take on a life of their own from multiple people, then you have egregores. They're like giant tulpas/servitors/thoughtforms that arise usually on their own from things in the world. Money is a huge egregore. So is the American Dream. Some suggest Coronavirus is one too. McDonalds, with its sigil and the way it manifests in our minds, is probably an egregore too.

4. Chaos magicians never believe they have the true truth, only what works for them. So some/many disagree even with these general concepts, or have their own versions of them.

I'm not even trying to be facetious here, it's an honest question.

Black Plague can easily be treated with antibiotics today. Black Plague was only that bad because it was in the fucking 1300-1500s. Antibiotics was discovered in 1920s. Black Plague was a bacterial infection.

You can't stop viruses with an antibiotic. You need antibodies (implying you already were infected with it) or vaccines to build those antibodies.

It's not equally as devastating. It is far more contagious down to the physics of it because it's much smaller than the flu and can penetrate PPE better than the flu.

You seem to have a core misunderstanding of what coronavirus actually is like so you should watch this layman's video first before talking any further on this sub because this explains WHY it's more deadly; because of its ability to overload the healthcare system rendering healthcare almost obsolete for majority of people who need treatment.

Even local services need drivers.

(St. Paul) – The Mayo Clinic today announced a series of cost-cutting measures, including furloughs and staff pay reductions, to prevent a projected $3 billion loss this year due to the COVID-19 crisis. Even with the measures, Mayo expects a $900 million shortfall this year.

Senator Carla Nelson (R-Rochester) issued the following statement:

“Mayo isn’t just the largest private employer in the state; it is one of the most important organizations in the fight against the coronavirus.

They are a world leader advancing treatments for the virus, like convalescent plasma therapy, antibody testing, and vaccine development.

>Stay-at-home orders, school closures and social distancing greatly reduce infections of the coronavirus, but lifting those restrictions after just 30 days will lead to a dramatic infection spike this summer and death tolls that would rival doing nothing, government projections indicate.

>The projections obtained by The New York Times come from the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. The models use three scenarios. The first has policy makers doing nothing to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. The second, labeled “steady state,” assumes schools remain closed until summer, 25 percent of Americans telework from home, and some social distancing continues. The third scenario includes a 30-day shelter in place, on top of those “steady state” restrictions.

>The documents, dated April 9, contain no dates for when shelter in places orders were delivered nor do they contain specific dates for when spikes would hit. The risk they show of easing shelter-in-place orders currently in effect in most of the country undercut recent statements by President Trump that the United States could be ready to reopen “very, very soon.”

>The model forsees a bump in the demand for ventilators — considered a stand-in for serious Covid-19 infection rates — 30 days after stay-at-home orders are issued, a major spike in infections about 100 days after, and peaking 150 days after the initial order. (Assuming further shelter-in-place policies are not implemented to reduce future peaks.)

>For most states that implemented stay-at-home orders in late March, including New York City, Massachusetts and Illinois, that spike would come in mid to late summer.

>The government’s conclusions are sobering. Without any mitigation, such as school closings, shelter-in-place orders, telework and socially distancing, the death toll from coronavirus could have reached 300,000. But if the administration lifts the 30-day stay-at-home orders, the death total is estimated to reach 200,000, even if schools remain closed until summer, 25 percent of the country continues to work from home and some social distancing continues.

>If nothing was done, infection rates would top out at 195 million Americans, and 965,000 people would require hospitalization in an intensive care unit, according to the projections’ “best guess.” But with a 30-day shelter in place and other measures, infections would still reach 160 million and 740,000 would need intensive care.

>The models show a higher demand for ventilators in the short term if states had never issued the stay-at-home orders. But the spike in demand 150 days after lifting such an order is expected to be more severe than if the United States had never issued such orders and instead relied on school closures, sending people home to telework and directing the public to socially distance.

>The federal agencies advised in the model that the projected demand for ventilators are “a worst-case scenario” and did not factor in states sharing the life-saving devices across state lines.

>Mr. Trump has teased the idea of reopening the United States to boost the economy, even as state governors, hospitals around the country and the federal government’s inspector general for Health and Human Services have warned of widespread shortages of test kits, protective gear and medical equipment.

>“You see what’s happening and where we are and where we stand,” Mr. Trump said. “And hopefully we’re going to be opening up — you can call it “opening” very, very — very, very soon, I hope.”

>But economists say that lifting restrictions — particularly on nonessential businesses — will restore some activity to an economy that is currently in free fall, shedding jobs and contracting rapidly.

>Many experts caution that growth will be slow when it returns, because people will be wary of resuming normal activities before the country has far more extensive testing for the virus to help people assess the risk of contracting it if they leave their homes. Such a system appears nowhere close to deployment.

>Across North America, Europe and elsewhere, factories are idled and workers are in lockdown. At some ports, goods are piling up, while elsewhere container ships sail empty. Dairy farmers are dumping their milk, while grocery store shelves have been picked bare.

>These disruptions in global trade could grow more noticeable in the months to come, as consumers hoard products and countries clamp down on exports of medical supplies and even food.

>Shoppers may see more shortages of unexpected products, including laptops, toilet paper and medicines. Some companies could find themselves lacking raw materials and components, a recipe for further financial trouble.

>So far this year, most of the disruptions have stemmed from factory shutdowns in China, a manufacturing hub for products like electronics and industrial machinery. Laptop exports from China to the United States have plummeted, for instance, just as demand is surging as companies switch to remote work and students are thrust into distance learning.

>But like the virus, which spread from China to the rest of the world, so too will the economic disruptions, which are likely to intensify in months to come. For companies and consumers who have come to rely on being able to ship goods rapidly and seamlessly around the world, the disruptions could come as a shock.

>“China has shown us how extreme the downturn in industrial activity can be,” said Chris Rogers, a global trade and logistics analyst at Panjiva.

>Across the United States and Europe, major manufacturers like Volkswagen and Ford have shuttered, in turn reducing demand for steel, electronics and other components.

>So far, many of the product shortages in the United States and Europe don’t stem from an actual lack of goods, but rather surging demand from consumers, who are stockpiling bleach, toilet paper, diapers and dried beans, unsure what the months to come will hold.

>Other shortages are occurring as producers of toilet paper, food and other products try to figure out how to rework supply chains that are set up to provide bulk shipments to restaurants and schools to instead meet household demand.

>The situation is likely to get worse over the next few months.

>Mike Jette, vice president of consulting services at GEP, which provides supply chain software and strategy for General Mills, Exxon Mobil, Macy’s, Walmart and other major companies, predicted that peak disruption for major companies with international supply chains would likely happen three months from now.

>Mr. Jette said that companies making electronics, appliances and other products would exhaust their “safety stock” for components in the coming weeks.

>Never have so many millions so suddenly lost their jobs. Never has the United States government vowed to spend so much money all at once to stave off economic ruin. Still, never has the financial security of so many been in such jeopardy.

>But what’s most immediate, never have Americans had to watch so many die day after day, separated from friends and family, the air drained from their lungs by a virus that was first detected in the country less than two months ago.

>“That is so shocking and painful and breathtaking, I don’t even have the words for it,”  said New York’s governor.

>Around the world, the official death count surged toward 100,000 and public health officials from Paris to Los Angeles said the only way to keep that figure from growing even faster would be to extend the lockdowns.

>The virus has yet to reveal many of its insidious mysteries, but new data and a growing body of research have shown that it preys on the human propensity to connect.

>In one densely crowded, seven-square-mile area in the center of the New York borough of Queens, it took just weeks for the virus to infect thousands. In theory, the pathogen infects princes and paupers alike, but working-class and immigrant communities like the one in Queens have been especially hard hit, exposing the deep inequities in American society and its health care system.

>The swift spread of the virus in locations where people live in cramped quarters has raised concern for vulnerable populations around the world. But it is also behavior — once common, daily behavior — that can give the virus life.

>A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed how one unsuspecting man who attended a dinner, a funeral and a birthday party in Chicago was the likely source of a chain of transmission that would lead to the infection of at least 15 people, three of whom later died.

>Yet Republican lawmakers in Kansas blocked efforts by the governor to restrict large gatherings, saying that worshipers should be able to attend Easter services.

>In most of the United States, even funerals have been canceled.

>Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said on Friday that the Trump administration had agreed to bipartisan negotiations with congressional leaders to break a stalemate over providing a $250 billion federal infusion to replenish a fast-depleting loan program for distressed small businesses."

Right now, a lot of scary stories are being shared of how rough it is having coronavirus and it's good that that's being shared now because that fear is encouraging people to take social distancing seriously.

But this thing only ends with herd immunity or with a vaccine 18+ months from now. Social distancing is just buying us time to ramp up virus testing, antibody testing, and figuring out treatments that work. It's not about keeping ME safe or YOU safe. It's about making sure we have space in the hospital to give the sickest folks high quality care.

Be careful right now, but try to frame it as buying time so that when you get sick, you get tested immediately, get prescribed a drug that will work, and have complete confidence that if you need a ventilator, there's one waiting for you."

[Here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/without-mass-testing-were-flying-blind-through-this-crisis/2020/04/09/bf61e178-7a9b-11ea-a130-df573469f094_story.html) is a Washington Post article by Fareed Zakaria (well-known political commentator on CNN) where he cites the article written by Dr. John Ioannidis that was circulating a few weeks ago ([here](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/) is the link to that article).

Basically, Zakaria points out that the original models cited by Fauci & Company had listed 100,000-120,000 deaths WITH lockdown measures in place. Then they were reduced to 80,000. Now, it's \~60,000; the estimated number of deaths from the 2019-2020 flu season. Since these estimates are all made WITH lockdowns present, the only thing that could have changed is that *the mortality rate for this disease is much lower than originally thought.*

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if these predictions continue to decrease over time. Hopefully Zakaria and other media personalities begin to change their tune soon."

We just crossed the 2000 daily death mark. We're about to surpass yesterday's number of daily new cases with hours left to go. New York and other states are reporting higher death tolls every day. I just don't understand how they can make that claim. 

The U.S. has the same number of tests/1 million people as Spain. We have 3 times the number of cases as them with 7 times the population and we're reporting 6-7 times the number of daily cases that they are. 

I just don't see how we can say daily deaths are going to start decreasing now when most cities haven't hit their peak yet and we're about to have way more cities peaking at the same time in the next 1-3 weeks. I don't see how we're only going to have 60k deaths before we can mass produce a vaccine. 

I think we're going to see a decline soon in daily deaths as New York will likely peak soon, but as New York starts declining, other states will start peaking and that daily death toll will start increasing to the point where we may see 3k or more dead a day. Either way we're probably staying above the 1500 daily dead mark for at least the next 3-4 weeks."

The City of Kalamunda council has voted unanimous to close the historic Zig Zag scenic drive to vehicles, citing serious dangerous driving and anti-social behaviour, but some residents are up in arms at the loss of their ‘brief moment of peace’ on the drive.

The popular switchback road, which was first built as a railway in 1891, takes travellers on a spectacular journey down the Darling Scarp, with stunning views of Perth from the top.

Kalamunda Mayor Margaret Thomas told ABC Perth's Breakfast show issues on the road had gotten out of hand. 

HOONING OUT OF HAND

""It was a very sad day,” she said of this week’s decision to close the road for six months from May 30.

""It doesn’t belong to just the community; it belongs to the whole of WA and so many visitors from overseas would go there and enjoy the views.

""We have had no option. We have done everything we could. 

""We increased our ranger patrols; we have CCTV at the top. 

""We put in chicanes to try and stop it being a racetrack. We tried to put blocks along the side so that 4WDs wouldn’t go in the bush.""

IT’S A RUBBISH TIP

However, Ms Thomas said the poor behaviour by some users had left the council with no other option, and the decision to close for six months was unanimous. 

""It’s a racetrack every night. All the roads are covered in rubber,"" she said.

""There is an accident every other week, the police are always there. 

""The dirt, the drug paraphernalia — it’s a rubbish tip.""

RESIDENT FURIOUS 

Perth Hills resident Michelle White told the ABC she was furious at the lack of consultation with the community over the closure and had already lodged a complaint with the council. 

She said the drive along the scenic roadway was a brief moment of happiness for her family while they socially distance due to coronavirus.

""We are self-isolating, but allowed out for work, shopping, important business and exercise,"" Ms White said.

""This scenic road is ten minutes from us, at the top of escarpment. 

""We take our dogs up there for a run because there's a big off-leash park and then we come down the hill via this beautiful road. 

""It has abundant bushland with native animals and stunning, sweeping views to the coast. 

""I know it seems like a silly thing to get upset about, but it's a local landmark and now it's become a simple pleasure in these tough times. 

""A pleasure that's being taken away because our local council is either too cheap, lazy or punitive to look at other ways of addressing anti-social behaviour.”""

COUNCIL HOPE TO RESET

Ms Thomas said she hoped the temporary closure would allow the council to reset and consider options over the next six months. 

""We are not saying this is forever,"" she said.

""We want to do something wonderful with it, and basically just take it back."""

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

>“There’s no reason why we can’t come to a bipartisan agreement by early next week,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement on Friday.

>The administration requested quick action to approve the money to bolster a loan program created by the $2 trillion stimulus law last month for small businesses, known as the Payment Protection Program. But Democrats blocked an effort by Republicans to push it through the Senate on Thursday during a procedural session, demanding conditions on the new funds and additional aid for hospitals, state and local governments and food aid.

>The package was to be an interim step as lawmakers look toward a far larger package expected to top $1 trillion to build on the stimulus law, which is likely to be negotiated later this month.

>As they battle a pandemic that has no regard for borders, the leaders of many of the world’s largest economies are undermining collective efforts to tame the coronavirus.

>At least 69 countries have banned or restricted the export of protective equipment, medical devices or medicines, according to the Global Trade Alert project at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. The World Health Organization is warning that protectionism could limit the global availability of vaccines.

>With every country on the planet in need of the same lifesaving tools at once, national rivalries are jeopardizing access to products that may determine who lives and who dies.

>“The parties with the deepest pockets will secure these vaccines and medicines, and essentially, much of the developing world will be entirely out of the picture,” said Simon J. Evenett, an expert on international trade who started the University of St. Gallen project. “We will have rationing by price. It will be brutal.”

>Some point to the tragedy playing out around the world as an argument for greater self-sufficiency, so that hospitals are less reliant on China and India for medicines and protective gear. China alone makes the vast majority of the core chemicals used to make raw materials for a range of generic medicines used to treat people now hospitalized with Covid-19.

>But if the laudable goal of diversification inspires every nation to look inward and dismantle global production, that will leave the world even more vulnerable, said Chad P. Bown, an international trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

>“You have now walled yourself off from the only way you can potentially deal with this, in your time of greatest need, which is relying on the rest of the world,” he said

>Michigan will forbid people from traveling between homes in the state beginning on Saturday, a sweeping expansion of the government’s efforts to contain the virus.

>In an executive order on Thursday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer effectively eliminated an exception to the state’s stay-at-home order that had allowed people to travel between homes. Beginning Saturday, the new order declares, “travel between two residences is not permitted.”

>“We must continue to do everything we can to slow the spread and protect our families,” Ms. Whitmer said in a statement.

>Although there are loopholes and exceptions — people can, for example, still travel to places for exercise — the order will newly bar residents from traveling to vacation properties, whether they own them or not.

>Michigan has among the most virus cases in the nation, and health officials have been particularly worried about the spread of the virus in and around Detroit.

>Ms. Whitmer also announced the creation of a task force to make recommendations to address the outbreak’s disproportionate impact on African-Americans. Michigan’s population is 14 percent black, but they make up 40 percent of the state’s virus victims. The group will be led by Garlin Gilchrist II, the state’s first African-American lieutenant governor.

>Public health experts attribute the disparity to longstanding inequalities. Black Americans disproportionately belong to part of the workforce that does not have the luxury of working from home. They are also less likely to be insured, and more likely to have pre-existing health conditions and face racial bias that prevents them from getting proper treatment, they said.

>In New York, still the center of the outbreak in the U.S., 777 more people had died, bringing the state total to 7,844, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Friday during his daily news briefing. While the death toll is sobering, he said there were reasons to be optimistic, with fewer patients in intensive care units and the number of hospitalized patients remaining nearly flat.

>“Stay home, because that works. We are flattening the curve,” he said, as officials across the country wrestle with when it will be safe to restart the economy and return to somewhat normal routines. “Now is the time to be smart.”

>“Let’s study the data and let’s look at what has happened around the world,” Mr. Cuomo said. “And let’s make sure the best health minds in the country are giving us their best advice.”

>Before there is talk of reopening, he said, millions of tests to diagnose people and test for antibodies are needed. He said New York labs were working on these tests but could not produce nearly what is needed and urged the president to use the Defense Production Act to require companies to produce tests in the millions. He said that testing at an “unprecedented scale” was required before people can return to work.

>“I don’t have that tool,” he said. “The federal government does.”

>With the rising death toll, the city has turned to a potter’s field in the Bronx to bury as many as 25 unclaimed bodies a day in an effort to make space in morgues for new victims.

>A few lone, holdout churches plan to defy local and federal officials this Easter weekend and meet for in-person services, despite stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidance from medical professionals.

>The vast majority of congregations are taking precautions, with many holding services online and innovating new ways of virtual worship. Easter occurs as the pandemic is reaching its peak in many places.

>But the restrictions over gatherings have frustrated some Christian pastors, particularly conservatives, who say the rules restrict their religious freedom.

>In Louisiana, Pastor Tony Spell of Life Tabernacle Church, who was recently arrested after holding in-person services, plans to hold Easter services for hundreds of people on Sunday. In Idaho, Ammon Bundy also plans to host hundreds of people for an Easter gathering, according to reports.

>Rev. Rodney Howard-Browne, pastor of River at Tampa Bay Church, was recently arrested for “intentionally and repeatedly” defying emergency orders in Florida, after he held in-person services.

>Some Catholics are urging bishops to find ways to hold some form of public mass, and to find safe access for the anointing of the sick.

>Elsewhere some churches are planning to celebrate via drive-up services, where congregants do not leave their vehicles. The Vatican will stream an Easter Mass celebrated by Pope Francis at St. Peters Basilica. Joel Osteen, who leads Lakewood Church in Texas, is streaming services with performances by Kanye West and Mariah Carey.

>Mr. Trump has said he plans to watch Easter services on a laptop, and Vice President Pence said his family plans to virtually attend from their living room.

>Prominent evangelical pastor Rick Warren, of Saddleback Church in California, encouraged pastors across the country to follow the guidelines in a CNN Town Hall Thursday night.

>“As shepherds, we are called to protect God’s flock, not just feed it and lead it,” he said. “And if you really love your congregation, tell them to stay at home on Easter.”

>Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said he was encouraged by — but not drawing too many conclusions from — the state’s first drop in the number of virus patients who were being treated in intensive care units.

>He said there were 1,132 people receiving intensive care as of Thursday, a 1.9 percent decrease from the day before.

>“One data point is not a trend,” Mr. Newsom warned. “One data point is not a headline, so I caution anybody to read too much into that one point of data, but nonetheless it is encouraging.”

>California’s decision to ship hundreds of ventilators to other states this week has been met with alarm by some local officials in places like Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, which has been among the hardest hit places in the state.

>Officials in the county, where there have been more than 1,100 cases and at least 32 deaths, said this week that the state had denied its request for ventilators, and that a second one was pending.

>On Thursday, Mr. Newsom sought to allay those concerns and pushed back against the idea that the state was neglecting its own needs."

However, tests are extremely important to the government, as it judges the spread of the disease.

As a result, the government should pay for it, as testing is more important to the government than the individual.

In more 2020 good news, as many of you know - a worse than normal hurricane season is expected:
1. Prediction: 4 major storms. At least one to make landfall - https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/weather/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season/index.html
2. Drivers: La Niña and uncharacteristically warm spring heating up ocean waters - https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/warmest-winter-on-record-gives-way-to-extra-early-signs-of-spring/

Now imagine landfall in Louisiana, as an example. Unless the magic fairy waves her wand and comes to jointly fully contain Coronavirus (optimistic) and the emerging Recession (very optimistic), hurricane season would likely result in a major humanitarian crisis. 

Tl;dr: outlook for Louisiana likely very, very bad

Louisiana is hugely vulnerable to a major humanitarian crisis if a hurricane is added to the mix:

>Stay-at-home orders, school closures and social distancing greatly reduce infections of the coronavirus, but lifting those restrictions after just 30 days will lead to a dramatic infection spike this summer and death tolls that would rival doing nothing, government projections indicate.

>The projections obtained by The New York Times come from the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. The models use three scenarios. The first has policy makers doing nothing to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. The second, labeled “steady state,” assumes schools remain closed until summer, 25 percent of Americans telework from home, and some social distancing continues. The third scenario includes a 30-day shelter in place, on top of those “steady state” restrictions.

>The documents, dated April 9, contain no dates for when shelter in places orders were delivered nor do they contain specific dates for when spikes would hit. The risk they show of easing shelter-in-place orders currently in effect in most of the country undercut recent statements by President Trump that the United States could be ready to reopen “very, very soon.”

>The model forsees a bump in the demand for ventilators — considered a stand-in for serious Covid-19 infection rates — 30 days after stay-at-home orders are issued, a major spike in infections about 100 days after, and peaking 150 days after the initial order. (Assuming further shelter-in-place policies are not implemented to reduce future peaks.)

>For most states that implemented stay-at-home orders in late March, including New York City, Massachusetts and Illinois, that spike would come in mid to late summer.

>The government’s conclusions are sobering. Without any mitigation, such as school closings, shelter-in-place orders, telework and socially distancing, the death toll from coronavirus could have reached 300,000. But if the administration lifts the 30-day stay-at-home orders, the death total is estimated to reach 200,000, even if schools remain closed until summer, 25 percent of the country continues to work from home and some social distancing continues.

>If nothing was done, infection rates would top out at 195 million Americans, and 965,000 people would require hospitalization in an intensive care unit, according to the projections’ “best guess.” But with a 30-day shelter in place and other measures, infections would still reach 160 million and 740,000 would need intensive care.

>The models show a higher demand for ventilators in the short term if states had never issued the stay-at-home orders. But the spike in demand 150 days after lifting such an order is expected to be more severe than if the United States had never issued such orders and instead relied on school closures, sending people home to telework and directing the public to socially distance.

>The federal agencies advised in the model that the projected demand for ventilators are “a worst-case scenario” and did not factor in states sharing the life-saving devices across state lines.

>Mr. Trump has teased the idea of reopening the United States to boost the economy, even as state governors, hospitals around the country and the federal government’s inspector general for Health and Human Services have warned of widespread shortages of test kits, protective gear and medical equipment.

>“You see what’s happening and where we are and where we stand,” Mr. Trump said. “And hopefully we’re going to be opening up — you can call it “opening” very, very — very, very soon, I hope.”

>But economists say that lifting restrictions — particularly on nonessential businesses — will restore some activity to an economy that is currently in free fall, shedding jobs and contracting rapidly.

>Many experts caution that growth will be slow when it returns, because people will be wary of resuming normal activities before the country has far more extensive testing for the virus to help people assess the risk of contracting it if they leave their homes. Such a system appears nowhere close to deployment.

>Across North America, Europe and elsewhere, factories are idled and workers are in lockdown. At some ports, goods are piling up, while elsewhere container ships sail empty. Dairy farmers are dumping their milk, while grocery store shelves have been picked bare.

>These disruptions in global trade could grow more noticeable in the months to come, as consumers hoard products and countries clamp down on exports of medical supplies and even food.

>Shoppers may see more shortages of unexpected products, including laptops, toilet paper and medicines. Some companies could find themselves lacking raw materials and components, a recipe for further financial trouble.

>So far this year, most of the disruptions have stemmed from factory shutdowns in China, a manufacturing hub for products like electronics and industrial machinery. Laptop exports from China to the United States have plummeted, for instance, just as demand is surging as companies switch to remote work and students are thrust into distance learning.

>But like the virus, which spread from China to the rest of the world, so too will the economic disruptions, which are likely to intensify in months to come. For companies and consumers who have come to rely on being able to ship goods rapidly and seamlessly around the world, the disruptions could come as a shock.

>“China has shown us how extreme the downturn in industrial activity can be,” said Chris Rogers, a global trade and logistics analyst at Panjiva.

>Across the United States and Europe, major manufacturers like Volkswagen and Ford have shuttered, in turn reducing demand for steel, electronics and other components.

>So far, many of the product shortages in the United States and Europe don’t stem from an actual lack of goods, but rather surging demand from consumers, who are stockpiling bleach, toilet paper, diapers and dried beans, unsure what the months to come will hold.

>Other shortages are occurring as producers of toilet paper, food and other products try to figure out how to rework supply chains that are set up to provide bulk shipments to restaurants and schools to instead meet household demand.

>The situation is likely to get worse over the next few months.

>Mike Jette, vice president of consulting services at GEP, which provides supply chain software and strategy for General Mills, Exxon Mobil, Macy’s, Walmart and other major companies, predicted that peak disruption for major companies with international supply chains would likely happen three months from now.

>Mr. Jette said that companies making electronics, appliances and other products would exhaust their “safety stock” for components in the coming weeks.

>Never have so many millions so suddenly lost their jobs. Never has the United States government vowed to spend so much money all at once to stave off economic ruin. Still, never has the financial security of so many been in such jeopardy.

>But what’s most immediate, never have Americans had to watch so many die day after day, separated from friends and family, the air drained from their lungs by a virus that was first detected in the country less than two months ago.

>“That is so shocking and painful and breathtaking, I don’t even have the words for it,”  said New York’s governor.

>Around the world, the official death count surged toward 100,000 and public health officials from Paris to Los Angeles said the only way to keep that figure from growing even faster would be to extend the lockdowns.

>The virus has yet to reveal many of its insidious mysteries, but new data and a growing body of research have shown that it preys on the human propensity to connect.

>In one densely crowded, seven-square-mile area in the center of the New York borough of Queens, it took just weeks for the virus to infect thousands. In theory, the pathogen infects princes and paupers alike, but working-class and immigrant communities like the one in Queens have been especially hard hit, exposing the deep inequities in American society and its health care system.

>The swift spread of the virus in locations where people live in cramped quarters has raised concern for vulnerable populations around the world. But it is also behavior — once common, daily behavior — that can give the virus life.

>A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed how one unsuspecting man who attended a dinner, a funeral and a birthday party in Chicago was the likely source of a chain of transmission that would lead to the infection of at least 15 people, three of whom later died.

>Yet Republican lawmakers in Kansas blocked efforts by the governor to restrict large gatherings, saying that worshipers should be able to attend Easter services.

>In most of the United States, even funerals have been canceled.

>Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said on Friday that the Trump administration had agreed to bipartisan negotiations with congressional leaders to break a stalemate over providing a $250 billion federal infusion to replenish a fast-depleting loan program for distressed small businesses."

So it's not the end of everything. But a vaccine is what it's going to take to go back to [what was normal](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/do-we-really-want-to-go-back-to-normal/) from here.  A vaccine, or this thing runs its course and everyone that's left is immune.

If we just let it go, and [wait for herd immunity](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-social-distancing-over-back-to-normal/608752/) that's going to [affect a lot of people.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html) And while [most of the people who get this](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/13/viral-image/are-80-percent-coronavirus-cases-mild/) are only going to have mild symptoms,  some people are going to need help. If everyone gets sick all at once, it will [overwhelm the hospitals.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/17/upshot/hospital-bed-shortages-coronavirus.html) People won't be able to get help. Everyone who normally needs the hospital won't be able to get help, either. [Choices](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/15/coronavirus-rationing-us/) will have to be made.

So the question is how many of those people, the ones who can make it but will need help, how many of them are we willing to write off to get back to normal? We could do absolutely nothing, and millions will die. This isn't an abstract number. This is people we know. You know. Your friends, your mom, you yourself. It could be anyone. This disease hits some groups harder than others, but no one is immune yet. That's why we're all inside.

Social distancing is meant to slow everything down. When they say ""flatten the curve"" [what they're really saying](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) is ""slow the rate of infection"". That's what the curve is measuring. 

We need to flatten it, which makes it peak less intensely but last longer. We do this so we stay below our hospital capacities. That means if someone needs a bed, for whatever reason but especially this lethal virus, there's one available. 

Once we have flattened the curve, we can [tweak social distancing rules](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/04/08/coronavirus-cases-how-long-social-distancing-marc-lipsitch/2963430001/) to let more people get sick. As soon as we ease social distancing, more people are going to get sick with this. But there will be hospitals available. We're not entirely sure how [we'll pay for it in the US](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/americans-worry-about-expenses-tied-to-coronavirus.html) US lawmakers are [already laying the groundwork](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/04/08/heres-where-lawmakers-stand-on-the-phase-four-stimulus-bill/#333bb54d5795) for the next phase of assistance.

We'll [keep doing that](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/half-americans-wear-masks-coronavirus-normal-takes-hold/story?id=70073942), kind of dipping our toe in the water and running back up on the beach, until it's over and we're all the way under and through. That happens [when there's a breakthrough](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/lockdowns-cant-end-until-covid-19-vaccine-found-study-says) or herd immunity puts a bubble around the people left who haven't caught it.

But the very, very first thing is [getting resources to hospitals.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/world/europe/coronavirus-boris-johnson-britain.html) We need to stop playing around. Every doctor we lose, every nurse and EMT and home health aide and everyone working directly with covid-19 cases and vulnerable people needs protection. Because as we lose them, [the baseline drops.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/world/europe/coronavirus-boris-johnson-britain.html) That means we need to flatten the curve even further. The only tool we have for that is stronger isolation requirements.

So we can't do anything about anything until we've got them protected. Then the goal is lowering the number of cases. Then we can ease restrictions for a while. 

I don't see this as any reason to lose hope. Most people are fine, if you can limit the number of people you infect if you catch it you've done your job. And [life will change](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/19/coronavirus-effect-economy-life-society-analysis-covid-135579) but life will go on."

> But this data is misleading because the most recent data shows that only .9% of deaths related to the coronavirus are related to individuals with no comorbidity (i.e. pre-existing conditions)

> Therefore based on this data, only 150 Americans have died from the coronavirus who had no pre-existing conditions out of 16,697. 

**No**. Bad Gateway Pundit. This is the worst kind of fake news, and you can see why in bold text in the screenshot in the article.

> Death Rate = (number of deaths / number of cases) = probability of dying if infected by the virus (%). This probability differs depending on pre-existing condition. The percentage shown below does **NOT represent in any way the share of deaths by pre-existing condition. Rather, it represents, for a patient with a given pre-existing condition, the risk of dying if infected by COVID-19.**

The Gateway Pundit reads the data exactly backwards, in direct contradiction to the bold text. It's not that 0.9% of people who died had none of these conditions. It's that 0.9% of people who caught the virus and had none of these conditions have died. 

We can dig further into this data. The comorbidity table shown in the article comes from Chinese data [here](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51). In China, people with no other conditions represented 13% of all deaths. If we assume that the demographics in the US are the same and that China's data is accurate (both of these assumptions are suspect) that would imply that the actual number of dead Americans to date with no other conditions would be **2,300**, not 150.

Furthermore, even if these numbers were right, is the conclusion that these lives are expendable? 68 million Americans, or 1/3 of adults, have hypertension alone. Do we not care about them?

In a [wide-ranging interview with the Benn Society](https://soundcloud.com/user-133732880/episode-two-jeremy-corbyn/s-QjiALyMQWG7), a new political education initiative led by trade unionist and London Assembly candidate Liam Young, Corbyn said divisions within the party in the wake of the EU referendum had denied it an outright victory in Theresa May’s snap election.

“We went into the general election in 2017 when they’d all written us off, and were astonished at how close we got to winning,” Corbyn said. “We were within a whisker of winning that general election.”

He went onto suggest that events the previous year - which saw the vast majority of his shadow cabinet resign, 172 MPs pass a motion of no confidence in his leadership and Owen Smith launch an ill-fated leadership bid – had been a block on electoral success for Labour.

“And had the party been more united than we had been in 2016, I’m absolutely confident we could have won that general election, because it was all absolutely going our way and our manifesto was very much in tune with the way people were feeling.”

Corbyn also signalled his support for mandatory reselection of Labour MPs and spoke of the need for his supporters on the left to frame their arguments around policies, rather than personality, as they come to terms with a new political reality in the wake of his replacement as leader by Keir Starmer.

With some on the left leaving the party in the wake of Corbyn’s departure – or threatening to do so – the Benn Society, which also secured [John McDonnell’s first major interview](https://soundcloud.com/user-133732880/episode-one-john-mcdonnell) since quitting as Shadow Chancellor last week, aims to convince his supporters to stay and fight within the party as its namesake did. Some on the Labour left are concerned that activists who joined to support Corbyn's leadership see his politics as a temporary aberration in the party's history, rather than a permanent fixture of its internal debate.

“The idea behind the Benn Society is a simple one: we want to show that the left is not a new force within the Labour Party, but a constant one,” Young, a Communications Workers Union staffer, told the *New Statesman*. “Tony Benn’s political philosophy centred around achieving change through the vehicle of the Labour Party and we’ve created this educational tool to demonstrate the historical context of the left within the party. Some have celebrated Jeremy’s departure as leader but they have done so prematurely. My generation has been inspired by his politics and we will keep the flame alive.”

Asked where the Labour left should go next, Corbyn told Young: “Don’t go into personal abuse and personal attacks. Don’t go into looking for sectarian arguments. Instead, look for issues that can unite and mobilise the left… frame the arguments and debates within the party around policies and principles, and not around individuals. Because if we spend all our time attacking each other because of our like or dislike of each other individually, it doesn’t actually get us anywhere in the end.”

Corbyn suggested the Labour left should instead focus its energies on responding to the economic and public health challenges posed by coronavirus, workers’ rights, global inequality, and a human rights-based foreign policy.  

Reflecting on his four years as Labour leader, he went on to speak of the difficulty he had faced in reforming the party’s internal structures – particularly on reselection processes for MPs, historically a cause celebre for the Bennite left.

“It was extremely difficult to reform the party,” Corbyn said. “We did make some changes, which changed the basis on which candidates for leader and deputy have to be nominated by constituency parties and affiliated organisations, as well as just MPs. The balance has moved slightly away from the exclusivity of the parliamentary Labour Party.

“The threshold for holding trigger ballots has been changed, so it is therefore not as difficult as it was for a trigger ballot to be held. There were debates over whether we should have a mandatory reselection process or not. That did not find enough support, particularly amongst unions, at the party conference \[in 2018\], so we have the system we now have.

He indicated that he remained supportive of mandatory reselection. “My own view is that democracy is best served when all members are fully involved in selection processes, and that MPs themselves are accountable to that process. In truth, most MPs have very little to fear from that process indeed... I think the points that Richard Burgon made during his deputy leadership campaign about bringing back mandatory reselection were actually well made and well taken, and I think it is an issue that will come up again.”

Unlike his immediate predecessors as Labour leader did after stepping down, Corbyn also stressed that he would continue to assert himself from the backbenches. “I hope those policies will continue, and indeed during the leadership debates, the three leadership candidates all essentially confirmed that the anti-austerity political agenda should continue... I hope that is the case, and I hope that they recognise that an accommodation with the Tories is not acceptable, and that has to be a point of unity of our party. I will certainly be making that case very strongly, as John and others have: the need to maintain a socialist economic policy.

“I won’t be going on world tours sponsored by any big business organisations, I have no directorships and don’t intend to have any - I’m not interested in that sort of life or activity at all. My job will be being MP for Islington North. It will be a lot of writing about the experience of the last five years and ideas for the future, and it will also be a lot of campaigning work and supporting different organisations and campaigns. I’ve offered to help also with political education in the party, and in unions before. Because surely the experience of life ought to be something one passes on for future generations to at least understand what went on? My political activity is not going to diminish in the slightest: I’ll be as busy as I’ve always been.”"

""It looks, so far, that warmer weather might do a little bit.

“The biggest impact is continuing our physical distancing efforts.”

THE EVIDENCE

Early analysis by scientists at MIT found that most coronavirus transmissions have occurred in regions with low temperatures, between 3 and 17 degrees Celsius, noting that countries with equatorial climates and those currently experiencing summer account for fewer than six per cent of global cases so far.

While the peer-reviewed study suggests that temperatures may play a role in the virus’s effectiveness, it does not stop it the transmission altogether."""

They lived about 20 minutes apart in Michigan, but when a cousin gave the sisters Lou Ann Dagen and Penny Dagen each an Amazon Echo Show last year to make video calls, they would keep each other company for hours on end.

The virtual assistant Alexa connected them during meals and discussions about what was on television.

“I think she just wanted to know that I was there,” Penny Dagen, 74, said of her sister, who lived in a nursing home.

And when Lou Ann Dagen, 66, became gravely ill with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, she turned once again to Alexa, Penny Dagen said in an interview on Thursday.

Ms. Dagen discovered voice recordings of her sister pleading with Alexa to intervene as her health worsened. She said she found the recordings on Monday, two days after Lou Ann Dagen died of complications from the virus.

“‘How do I get help?’” her sister asked in the recording. “‘How do I get to the police?’”

Lou Ann Dagen was one of six residents of the nursing home, Metron of Cedar Springs, who died after being stricken with the virus, a spokesman for the center confirmed. Thirty-one residents and five staff members at the nursing home, which is about 20 miles north of Grand Rapids, Mich., have tested positive for the virus, according to the nursing home.

“I was surprised how much she had cried for help on there,” Penny Dagen said. “She was hurting so bad.”

Ms. Dagen said she and her sister were aware of the limitations of Alexa, the ubiquitous voice-activated assistant.

“It won’t call 911,” she said. “Alexa won’t do that.”

Amazon officials said that smart devices like the Echo Show are not meant as a replacement for life safety services and are unable to contact emergency services.

“We were saddened to hear about this news, and our hearts go out to the family,” a company spokeswoman said on Thursday night in a statement. “Today, customers can ask Alexa to call family or friends, or set up skills like Ask My Buddy, which lets you alert someone in your Personal Alert Network that you need them to check on you. We continue to build more features to help our customers.”

Ms. Dagen said that her sister had diabetes and high blood pressure, which also contributed to her death. She lived at the nursing home for about 10 years after having two strokes that caused paralysis on the left side of her body, Ms. Dagen added. Her oxygen levels plummeted because of the virus, which she contracted several weeks ago, said Ms. Dagen, who lives in Sparta, Mich.

“It was like she couldn’t breathe,” she said of her sister, who died at Mercy Health St. Mary’s in Grand Rapids on Saturday, shortly after being hospitalized.

A nursing home executive said that the center took appropriate action and that Lou Ann Dagen’s condition deteriorated rapidly.

“We can share that Lou Ann was getting excellent care and that our team was following both her advanced directives and clinical practice guidelines to manage her pain and symptoms,” Paul Pruitt, the nursing home’s director of operations, said in a statement. “Once those symptoms progressed rapidly, and at the advice of her medical team, she was immediately sent to the hospital.”

Mr. Pruitt said the nursing home encouraged the sisters’ regular video calls.

“Alexa was Lou Ann’s primary communication tool with her sister, who was unable to get to our facility,” he said. “It was a very positive part of her life, which we supported fully.”

Penny Dagen described her sister, who never married, as multitalented, and said that she played the organ, piano and guitar. She also sang and was an artist who wrote a children’s book, Ms. Dagen said.

The last time she spoke with her sister was on a video call on Saturday morning before she went to the hospital, Ms. Dagen said. She added that she had the recordings of her sister asking Alexa for help on her iPad, but that she did not plan on keeping them.

“I don’t want to keep that memory of her,” she said. “I just wish they could have taken the pain away. She isn’t in any pain any more.”"

OUR HOSPITALS!!!

right now my wife, who is an RN at Brampton Civic, is rationed 1 procedural mask for her 12 hour shift.

Not an N95 mask which is what she actually needs, but a [single paper mask](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/covid-19-surgical-masks-may-help-but-not-as-first-line-of-defense) that lasts for a maximum 3hrs before it becomes completely ineffective.

2 weeks ago she would have been fired for seeing 2 patients using the same mask, now she is told to wear the same mask with ALL her patients, for 12hrs.  She has to put it back on after eating lunch.

The hospitals are collecting all the used masks so that if they are forced to they can try and sanitize them so the staff can reuse them.  That is how bad it is at Brampton Civic right now.

The need is most desperate at our hospitals.

Go to the hospital right now with your entire stock and [DONATE IT ALL!](https://oslerfoundation.akaraisin.com/ui/PPEDrive/volunteer/start)

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak
What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions
Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
Your own health status
The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.
Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation
UNDERSTAND THE RISK
Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.
BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE
Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.
EDUCATE YOURSELF
Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
Ask for written information when available.
Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.
WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS
If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.
CONNECT WITH OTHERS
Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.

They’ve saved more lives and prevented more anguish than anything else humans have ever created. Better than refrigeration. Better than antibiotics. Better than motherfucking SOAP.

How can you be so dumb to think that people in 3rd world countries get by just fine without vaccines? They’ll travel for days, and spend money they should be using for food, to get their children vaccinated. Because they’ve seen their other children die from things most antivaxxers have never heard of.

There’s a child out there somewhere who has died of rotavirus-induced diarrhea in the time it’s taken me to write this comment. For no reason, because they didn’t have access to a vaccine that costs pennies to produce. An entire life, lost for want of a $0.12 dose. I know this because I worked on that vaccine. So toddlers don’t have to shit themselves to death when it can be easily prevented.

The ignorance and hubris required to question the modern vaccine schedule which is, again, the single greatest enabler of health ever created, is mind-boggling. You don’t deserve vaccines and I’d suggest you skip the one we come up with for coronavirus. The one that our species needs to develop if we want to preserve the society we’ve spent the last 10,000 years creating. Read a fucking book."

I heard from people who were put on a state/municipal  program and hated it, their POs would do everything they could to find trouble. I was terrified, they’re going through shit on a local level, what was going to happen to me?

I failed my first drug test (I was a young, stupid stoner.) had to go back for a second one a couple weeks later. Before I got into trouble I stole a bunch of street signs, of course the cops come after my probation paperwork is all sorted out. Now I’m thinking I’m gonna go to a federal prison for this. 

Nothing really came of it except getting asked why I didn’t report my arrest. I met with my probation officer in person for the first 3 months, then she got sent to some training out of state. I had to fill out paperwork to send to her the remaining 3 months then got my discharge paperwork. 

I literally failed half my drug tests and got arrested while on federal probation. I don’t know if it was my PO or the drug and alcohol counseling I was going through that helped but I made sure to stop being a dumbass. Up until coronavirus I was actually really successful for someone who was going down a rough road. 10 years later I’m thankful I had the probation officer and the drug counseling to put me on the right path. 

I still smoke weed though. I won’t stop that ever.

Citizens on Chinese social media have said that seven Wuhan funeral homes will likely distribute 3,500 urns per day on average from March 23 to April 4, which marks Qing Ming, the traditional tomb-sweeping festival. By that estimate, 42,000 urns would be given out in the 12-day period.

> This unintended experiment in coronavirus spread will help researchers estimate the number of fatalities that would occur in a fully infected population, Levitt said. For instance, the Diamond Princess data allowed him to estimate that being exposed to the new coronavirus doubles a person's risk of dying in the next two months. Most people have an extremely low risk of death in a two-month period, so that risk remains extremely low even when doubled.

Essentially, if I catch Covid, my chances of dying double over a two month period.  So my options are indefinite quarantine or a slightly higher chance of death for a two month period.  I imagine that decision is a no-brainer for most, at least those without a serious medical condition.  And maybe some healthy people would prefer to stay quarantined; not my place to judge.

But instead of having this chance to move on with our lives, leaders are depriving our liberty by making the choice for us, and will continue to make that choice as long as we allow them."

If we start to point fingers now, it will only cause endless debate that who needs to pay for whom and it is just pure waste of energy and time which we should spend on much more important things. And the idea itself is unwise because I don't want to start the fiasco that once I catch a flu and spend on curing it, I need to track down the sources of it and make them pay.



At last, I need to stress on some facts:

1. China reported the 1st case early in Dec.2019. 

2. China announced that it is a highly contagious disease on 20-JAN-2020. Which is around 1.5 months after the 1st case reported. Take note, China is a 1.4B population country that it takes time for anything to rise an alert. But at that point, China has already isolated a new virus and examine its RNA, which all takes time.

3. China lock down Wuhan the next day and soonly the whole country. The whole world scorn on China's ""over react"", some even call it ""concentration camp"".

4. 2 months later, COVID-19 outburst worldwidely and some government says that ""wearing a mask does not help at all"". And today there are still ppl refuse to wear a mask and attack whomever wears one.

5. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-live-updates.html

I noticed that they conveniently left out her political grandstanding using Covid-19 to do it.

Going on interviews condemning the federal government for being slow, complaining about not having any federal aid, ***when she knew that she hadn't even applied for federal aid yet***. 

It's no secret that she was publicly criticizing the federal government. In mid March she said:

>*On closing restaurants and bars, Whitmer said, “In order to flatten the  curve, we need to be aggressive on the front end.* ***The federal government  did not take this seriously early enough***, and now it is on us to make  sure we’re doing everything we can based on the best facts and science  available ***and that we are always putting the health of our people front  and center***.  It was a tough decision to make, but we know the spread of  this virus  is dependent on close proximity. This is one of many steps  we’re taking  in the state of Michigan.”

She also stated:

>*Whitmer said, “This has to be all hands on deck. Cutting red tape,* ***moving as quickly as we possibly can***, and ***being aggressive and smart  about our reaction***.

And:

>*We  need respirators and ventilators and personal protection equipment.  We  need more test kits and the resources to process those test kits* ***in a  quick, expedited manner***.”

And yet another:

>*Ruhle asked, “Can you get them? Can you get them without federal support?”*  
*Whitmer responded, “No, no.* ***We need federal support.*** *Like  I said,  we’re pulling out all of the stops and reaching out to our  partners in  the private sector and we’re going to do everything we can  to supplement  but* ***it’s not to the exclusion of federal support***. ***We need the federal  government to ramp up and get this done***.”

She's  saying all of this mid March. Do you know what she knows while she's  publicly thrashing the federal government for being slow and unprepared?  ***She knows that she hadn't even applied for aid yet.***

And as of March 25, ***she still hadn't applied for federal aid yet***.:

>*Michigan  has not yet requested a major disaster declaration for the   coronavirus, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency   said Wednesday. . .*  
*. . .Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, said Wednesday  morning that state officials were* ***""reviewing and looking into""*** *a request  to FEMA. By Wednesday afternoon, after the Free Press published a story  on the issue, Brown said officials were* ***""working urgently""*** *on a  disaster request.* ***She did not immediately respond to a question about  why the request was not completed sooner***.

That's  right. While she was making all of those accusations against the  President and the federal government, trying to make it sound like she  just working her ass off, ***she still hadn't even applied for aid yet.***

>*Tori  Sachs, executive director of the conservative  group Michigan Rising  Action, said it is ""unfortunate"" that Whitmer  ""didn't know that going  on cable news to blast the president won’t get  the state any federal  disaster resources* ***if the governor doesn’t submit a  request for the funds***.""  
*""****This is state emergency management 101****,"" Sachs said in a news release.* 

*Michigan's request for a disaster declaration came* [*one day after the Free Press revealed*](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/03/25/fema-michigan-disaster-declaration-coronavirus/5077623002/) *that* ***Michigan had not yet made a request to FEMA***, at a time when several other states had already had their requests granted.

So she ***finally*** filed for assistance ***on 3/26.*** All the while blaming it on the President and the federal government that the state of Michigan had no aid.

Political posturing. Trying to make herself look like a victim. All the while ***knowing full well that she hadn't even filed for aid***. Every interview she gave, every negative thing she said. Knowing the ***real*** truth.

Personally  I think that after making all of those false accusations, especially  knowing that they were false while she was saying them, has earned her  all the lack of respect that she got from the President. ""Bully"" indeed.

2020-04-10,Awastelandcompanion,Hamilton,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hamilton/comments/fykklc/ticketed_for_walking_a_dog/fn0he04/,"When Hamilton nurse Nicole Lau was approached by a bylaw officer the other day she figured she might be in trouble for letting her dog roam free.

With leash-free dog parks closed because of the COVID-19 emergency, Lau was illicitly giving Opie the boxer a chance to stretch his legs and fetch the stick.

“I knew he was off-leash; I know I was in the wrong,” Lau says.
She braced herself to possibly be fined a couple of hundred bucks for breaking dog owner rules. Instead the bylaw officer slammed her with a jaw-dropping $880 ticket for failing to comply with COVID-19 emergency orders.

Lau’s offence?

She was walking at the time in the wide-open spaces of the now-closed Chedoke golf course in west Hamilton.

Lau, a 32-year-old hematology nurse at Hamilton Health Sciences, was amazed. She knew that — like playgrounds, parks, sports fields and other outdoor gathering places — the city’s golf courses had been closed for normal activities because of the coronavirus.

“But I didn’t know that any kind of use of the golf course was prohibited.”

As with many other green spaces, Lau thought Chedoke could still be used as a walk-through.

While she and her boyfriend were exercising Opie they saw other people in the distance running, strolling and walking their pooches through Chedoke. They had no idea it’s completely off limits. She says the city signage they saw was vague.

According to city spokesperson Allison Jones, the city’s Emergency Operations Centre team reviewed whether golf courses could be used as walking spaces on March 27, the day after they were ordered closed.

Jones said by email that the team determined that “walking in these locations could be hazardous to residents as there will be grass cutting and other turf maintenance machinery on-site to ensure these spaces are ready for immediate use once restrictions are lifted.”

That’s pretty thin gruel at a time when people are hungry for green spaces to ramble in. But sometimes emergencies do call forth paternal/maternal overreactions by cautious authorities. So Chedoke and other golf courses will, like other city facilities, remain verboten until May 25.

Lau says her encounter with the bylaw officer, an animal control officer as it turned out, was “actually very pleasant.”

“I thought he was just, you know, educating us.”

Frankly, she was expecting leniency for a first-time offence. A warning not to do it again. And why wouldn’t she?

After all, the bylaw officers roaming the city to enforce the COVID-19 emergency orders are all armed with a powerful decision-making tool called discretion.

Each of them has the ability to assess any violation they come across and decide whether or not a charge is warranted under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

Unfortunately, the bylaw officer Lau bumped into must have encased his discretion in an iron mitt. Now Lau has an $880 ticket ($750 for the set fine, $130 for victim surcharge and costs) to contend with. When the time comes, she intends to fight it.

In many ways, Lau is embarrassed by the whole thing. She knows she has a good job and is lucky to be working while many others have been laid off because of COVID-19. But $880 is still a lot of money, more even than one of her mortgage payments.

She can’t help wondering what innocent transgressors who may not be as fortunate as she is will do if they’re also denied the courtesy of a warning.

As a nurse, Lau says she’s well aware of the importance of social distancing and other restrictions and limitations placed on people to slow the spread of COVID-19. But she doesn’t believe her actions in any way compromised that. The closest person was hundreds of metres away.

Except for the bylaw officer, that is. Lau says he was standing right next to her while he was explaining the ticket. So much for social distancing."

LOL. This ""21st century majority"" is so budding that bernie couldn't even win the nomination against someone who literally has dementia. 

> [Speaking on MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/newsom-california-has-deal-for-200-million-masks-per-month-81763397587), Governor Gavin Newsom said that he would use the bulk purchasing power of California “as a nation-state” to acquire the hospital supplies that the federal government has failed to provide. If all goes according to plan, Newsom said, California might even “export some of those supplies to states in need.” 

So... he's going to do the very thing that the media went bananas over when Trump suggested states should handle this kind of thing on their own? Whoa. Way to own the orange man! Do exactly what he suggested you do. Brilliant!

> Third, and this may be the most enduring effect, Newsom is sending a powerful message to both political parties. So far, the Republican Party’s war on democratic [values](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/politics/trump-impeachment-timeline/), [institutions](https://www.lawfareblog.com/why-trumps-inspector-general-purge-not-national-scandal) and [laws](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-sets-arguments-trump-taxes-financial-records-cases-could-n1127481) has been a largely one-sided affair, with the GOP [assaulting](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/4/18123784/gop-legislature-wisconsin-michigan-power-grab-lame-duck) and the Democratic Party [defending](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/26/democrats-file-suit-against-trump-officials-over-census-documents.html). The lethal ruling this week by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Republican bloc, which required [Wisconsin residents](https://twitter.com/TrudyandPierre/status/1247693757639770113) to vote in person 

Hey, if there's a virus then we just shred the constitution. No big deal! Anything else would be ""lethal"". 

> The GOP [intends](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/03/trump-2020-election-legal-battle-coronavirus-162152) to restrict vote-by-mail and other legitimate enfranchisement 

How on earth is vote by mail ""legitimate enfranchisement""? Why not vote by fucking facebook? 

> Newsom, leader of the nation’s largest state, is perhaps accelerating that response, shaking Democrats out of denial and putting Republicans on notice.  

So let me get this straight. Gavin Newsom decides to do the very thing that Trump suggested he do, and the very thing that defines our constitutional republic, and somehow this is ""putting republicans on notice""? The left has so thoroughly detached from reality it's actually a little frightening. 

> “The federal government is no longer a reliable partner in delivering health care, in supporting immigrants, supporting LGBT people, in protecting the environment, so we need to forge our own path,”  

Uh, so in other words exactly how our government has been operating for 200 years? My god this will surely be the end of le drumpf!

> California is a sanctuary state while the Trump administration is fond of immigration dragnets.  

Sorry, your states rights end when it comes to allowing people from foreign nations to suck up my tax dollars. 

> The Trump administration endorses extreme gun rights; California has [other ideas](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article238673638.html).  

The constitution has some ideas in it too. Guess which side it supports?

>  
One conflict, however, encompasses all others, and could galvanize Californians into new ways of thinking about their state and its relationship to Washington. The GOP war on democracy is inspired by a drive for racial and cultural supremacy that jeopardizes the democratic aspirations and human rights of California’s multiracial citizenry.  

This person is genuinely mentally ill. 

> If California and other 21st-century polities withhold revenue, or otherwise distance themselves from Washington’s control, legal and political battles will escalate. Republicans will have a legitimate constitutional argument — but it will be a morally tainted and politically illegitimate one so long as they continue to [subvert](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/4/18123784/gop-legislature-wisconsin-michigan-power-grab-lame-duck) majority rule. 

Now xir is literally rehashing their masturbation fantasy they had last night.

A meat packing plant in Colorado where dozens of employees have contracted the novel coronavirus is closed for a deep cleaning and all workers will be tested before they can return to their jobs, officials said Friday.

The union that represents 3,000 employees at the JBS plant in Greeley said in a letter to state, county and company officials that two of its members have died.
The union says at least 50 employees are infected with the virus; the company, which is headquartered in Greeley, put the number of JBS workers with Covid-19 at 36.
The company said it was spending $1 million on test kits.

Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

What Is Social Distancing?

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

What Is Quarantine?

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

What Is Isolation?

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

•	⁠Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
•	⁠Your own health status
•	⁠The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease
•	⁠The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you
•	⁠The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease
•	⁠Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security
•	⁠The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items
•	⁠Concern about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care
•	⁠Uncertainty or frustration about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future
•	⁠Loneliness associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones
•	⁠Anger if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence
•	⁠Boredom and frustration because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities
•	⁠Uncertainty or ambivalence about the situation
•	⁠A desire to use alcohol or drugs to cope
•	⁠Symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much
•	⁠Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

•	⁠Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.
•	⁠Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

•	⁠Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.
•	⁠Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

•	⁠Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.
•	⁠Ask for written information when available.
•	⁠Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

•	⁠Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.
•	⁠Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
•	⁠Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

•	⁠Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.
•	⁠Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.
•	⁠If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.
•	⁠Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.
•	⁠Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.
•	⁠Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.
•	⁠If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

•	⁠Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

•	⁠Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.
•	⁠Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.
•	⁠Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
•	⁠Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

Supposedly the US is starting to do antibody testing and that is good because that’ll show how many people that actually have it who are not showing symptoms or have had it in the past and just not have known. I have hope that in the next few months we will find some sort of treatment.

I'm getting most of my information from what Fauci, WHO, and the CDC say as well as the charts from NYTimes and Worldometer.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/

If you look at the rate of infections & deaths in Italy, it basically follows a curve. From my understanding, this is how viral infections work. Without quarantining or social distancing, the peak would go very high and everyone who could get sick would. We don't want that because medical supplies are maxed out in most of the US and in many other areas.

So by doing quarantining and social distancing, we limit the peak of the curve, but we still have people in our population that don't have the disease and we don't have a vaccine or multiple tests for everyone, so if we had a ""everybody go back to normal day"" the curve would start again as if we had no quarantining and we'd have to quarantine again because we're back in our original situation.

That's why I think waves are inevitable until we get a vaccine. By loosening the strictness of the social distancing guidelines, the virus will spread, and then we will have to tighten them up again to slow the spread. Many people have already been infected (healthcare workers, supermarket workers, deliver people) so assuming they can't catch it again we've lowered the max potential peak, but should one infected person get in contact with another, boom, here goes another peak. Each subsequent viral wave will be lower than the last, but there are significant parts of the population where covid-19 is a death sentence. (Elderly, those with pre-existing conditions, etc.)

So that's my logic. I'm open to any criticisms on it. I don't think I'm making any crazy leaps or weird assumptions. If I could predict the future I'd be far more rich than I am now and I wouldn't be posting here."

>When the federal government began rushing trillions of dollars of assistance to Americans crushed by the pandemic, the hope was that some of the aid would allow businesses to keep workers on the payroll and cushion employees against job losses.

>But so far, a staggering number of Americans — more than 16 million — have lost their jobs amid the outbreak. Businesses continue to fail as retailers, restaurants, nail salons and other companies across the country run out of cash and close up shop.

>There is a growing agreement among many economists that the government’s efforts were too small and came too late in the fast-moving pandemic to prevent businesses from abandoning their workers. Federal agencies, working in a prescribed partnership with Wall Street, have proved ill equipped to move money quickly to the places it is needed most.

>Flooded by requests for help like never before, a federal program that was supposed to deliver emergency relief to small businesses in just three days has run low on funding and nearly frozen up entirely.

>The initiative, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, is an expansion of an emergency system run by the Small Business Administration that has for years helped companies after natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes.

>But in the face of the pandemic, the loan program is drowning in requests. Many applicants have waited weeks for approval, and while the program is supposed to offer loans up to $2 million, many recent applicants said the S.B.A. help line had told them that loans would be capped at $15,000 per borrower.

>In a sign of how the coronavirus pandemic has changed the face of Congress, Representative Don Beyer, Democrat of Virginia, gaveled in a procedural session of the House on Friday morning wearing latex gloves and a brown cloth mask obscuring his entire face up to his eyes.

>“It’s not my normal look but we are not living in normal times,” Mr. Beyer said on Twitter, where he posted a screen grab from C-Span showing him on the House rostrum holding the gavel, a large American flag behind him, wearing the protective gear. “Those who would lead must do first by example.”

>Even as public health officials recommend that people wear masks to guard against transmission of Covid-19, Mr. Trump has said he is not interested in wearing one, telling reporters that he could not see himself sitting at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office in such equipment. “Somehow, I don’t see it for myself,” Mr. Trump said. “I just don’t.” (His wife, Melania, however, tweeted a picture of herself on Thursday wearing a medical mask and noting that the C.D.C. was advising people to cover their faces.)

>Mr. Beyer previously self-isolated last month as a precaution after possible exposure to someone with the coronavirus. He said the mask he wore on Friday, which had coffee filters inside, was made by his daughter. His decision to wear it reflected the concerns lawmakers have about returning to Washington for legislative business at a time when experts have recommended avoiding traveling or congregating in large groups.

>While Congress is scheduled to return on April 20, lawmakers in both chambers have  suggested in recent days that the meeting may get pushed back.

>Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, who oversaw the last procedural session in the House on Tuesday, took a similar precaution, wearing a black mask made by his 11-year-old daughter, Molly. Mr. Sherman did not wear gloves during his brief moments of presiding over the chamber.

>It led to chaotic scenes, heath jitters and long delays in Wisconsin on Tuesday after Republicans went to court to block the Democratic governor’s attempt to postpone its primary. Other states have postponed elections. And with many officials advocating voting by mail during the pandemic, Mr. Trump and some Republican are raising debunked claims about fraud.

>But the election now underway in South Korea highlights a very different approach.

>To make its voting run smoothly, South Korea has mobilized armies of public servants, including young men doing civic duty in lieu of mandatory military service, to prepare for its parliamentary elections. They have disinfected 14,000 voting stations across the country, and marked waiting lines at three-foot intervals so voters can avoid standing too close to one another.

>Millions of voters are taking advantage of early voting, ahead of the official election day next Wednesday. Anyone showing temperature readings higher than 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit) is supposed to be stopped at the gates of polling stations and escorted to a separate area to vote. The voter is then supposed to be sent for testing, and the voting booth disinfected.

>In Wisconsin, state health officials said Friday that they would track virus cases thought to be tied to this week’s balloting.

>The Wisconsin Department of Health Services said in a statement that there was “some risk” people had been exposed to the virus while voting or working at the polls.

>“We hope the extraordinary efforts taken by local clerks, public health, voters and poll workers helped minimize any transmission, but we stand prepared to respond if that isn’t the case,” said Andrea Palm, the state health secretary.

>If voters or poll workers contracted the virus, the first new cases will most likely start emerging next week, the department said.

>Wearing a face covering takes some adjustment. To get the most benefit, you need to wear it consistently and correctly. Here are some pointers."

2020-04-10,hei_mailma,TheMotte,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/fy56hh/the_global_dollar_short_squeeze/fn11l3d/,"\>Based on the numbers, my view is that this third dollar spike likely ends when the Federal Reserve expands its monetary base by trillions of dollars to fund U.S. government deficits over the next several years, for lack of sufficient foreign and private buying of that debt. If performed at sufficient scale, this would loosen the global dollar liquidity shortage. There are a few different paths and timelines that could occur between now and then, and it’s a process more-so than an event. Central banks can also perform currency swaps or other agreements as needed, if they coordinate.

This is interesting, because it's remarkably prescient. There was a massive dollar shortage about a month ago during the coronavirus stock market crash. For some reason or other (multiple theories seem to exist) everyone was selling US Treasuries (i.e. US debt) and nobody was buying them. Note that traditionally US Treasuries are the most liquid type of financial assets in existence, not being able to sell US Treasuries is a huge deal. The Federal reserve (US central bank, henceforth ""The Fed"") stepped in and started buying massive amounts of US Treasuries in order to prop up the market, and have told people they will buy as many as it takes to calm the market (this is a huge step, previous buying of Treasuries by the Fed were always limited to a specific maximum amount). They have also taken a number of other truly unprecedented steps to supply liquidity, such as (a) buying other forms of (private) debt (b) setting reserve requirements for banks to zero, i.e. banks can lend regardless of whether they have anything backing the lending (c) sending interest rate targets to zero (I'm not sure which ones). In a sense, the Fed is printing huge amounts of dollars, though at this point they claim that they will take them out of the system again once things calm down, i.e. the dollars they are printing are ""loans""."

I'm probably the last person to advocate for the homeless because they cause me so many problems around the office.

The hurricane season this year in combination with COVID has the potential for so much more devastation than we've even come to expect with worse and worse weather patterns every year. The same can be said for fires, or earthquakes. The calculus that has been completely altered for me is the civil and econimic disturbance side of it, I know others have already mentioned it in this thread. We are at such a huge economic inflection point right now which I'm not sure most people can fathom. The Federal Reserve has stepped in to ensure liquidity in the markets and prevent a complete meltdown of the economy as well as backstop the incomes of individuals. I believe this is right and is necessary, but I also believe it has been indisriminate and perhaps necessarily but unforunately rushed.

The Fed started buying commercial paper, that is to say corporate bonds as well as CLOs (collateralized loan obligations) an instument in many ways similar to the mortgage backed CDOs that were the time bomb at the heart of the GFC. Yesterady (Thursday April, 9th) the Fed extended this to commercial paper with a junk rating. As someone who follows the economy quite rigorously let me say that a corporate debt bubble was already being talked about as a source of the next recession even before the Coronavirus destroyed the cash flow of many of these companies. The best economists in the world are unable authoratatively judge the 1, 2 or 5 year impact of this and I don't claim the gift of prophecy but let me lay out a hypothesis or two.

For years we have been in a low interest rate and low inflation environment which has confounded traditional Keynesian economists and has led to the development of a new theory called modern monetary theory or MMT. While I don't fully understand the mechanics of this the basic priniple is that easy money (read as low interest rates) does not actually easily lead to signifigant inflation as it relates to the USD because the majority of debts globally are denominated in USD. When the majority of global debts are denominated against one measure of value it's hard to have inflation because the inherent value of those debts (read the collateral against which those loans are made) doesn't really change so the printing of new money does not casue inflation to the extent that Keynes or other traditional economist would have assumed. Ok, still with me?

The Fed is reponsible for something called the Repo (repurchase) market which exists in the interest of global liquidity. Repo ammounts to extremely short term loans that the Fed gives out to to what are known as primary dealers (generally speaking systemically important financial institutions). They issue these in the form of governament backed securities (bonds) which the primary dealers then pass on as a form of loan, with an agreement to repurchase it at the end of the term, to other smaller banks and institutions needing liquidity. For this to happen the smaller banks and institutions need to post collateral. These loans are short term in the extreme, sometimes on an overnight basis.

Now, like I said I don't fully undersatnd these markets, probably few individuals completely do. The concerns I have about it relate the the due diligence that should be done on the assets being posted as collateral. The Fed has stepped in to buy commercial paper and thereby prop up the price of assets assuming that we will quickly return to growth after the Coronavirus has passed, meaning they are responsible for the very illusion of value given to the assets being posted as collateral for the repo they are distributing. So for me the big question is, what if we are unable to return to growth? What if investors in equities (generally forward looking and confident that coronavirus is a 2 quarter event at most) suddenely loose confidence in that thesis? If the markets decide to call bullshit on the idea of a V or U shaped revovery as is the parlance and asset prices are suddenly reevaluated to reflect a long term slow down in global GDP (not yet the base case for most investors) then what becomes of the repurchase agreements backed by now worthless or signifigantly devaued assets, and moreover what happens to the junk bonds the Fed added to their balance sheet?

Now like I said, I'm just one guy trying to make sense of this, not an expert or someone with a lot of training when it comes to these types of markets, but that being said I have some grave concerns about the state of the global economy that are at their root related to the shutdown caused by COVID but in fact are much deeper, ie. this mandated temporary shut down of the economy could be the pin that pricks one of the greatest economic bubbles of all time. That bubble being the huge expansion of price to earnings ratios and corporate debt since the end of the last recession. It's not the banks this time guys, it very well could lead right back to the heart of the Federal Reserve."
2020-04-10,SBIII,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fyqqzo/sweden_taking_lax_approach_to_coronavirus_top_doc/fn1mjj4/,"If you compare Sweden with Ireland - you'll see a few interesting things; 

Both countries recorded their first known transmission around the same date. Ireland brought in a series of strict lockdown measures in March, which I outlined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fyrmwa/ireland_extends_coronavirus_lockdown_until_may_5/). Sweden didn't. 

You would expect to see a big difference in the mortality rates of the two countries, yet, Sweden's mortality rate per 1 million head of capita is just 1.6 times higher than that of Ireland's. To date, the death rate has not soared expotentially and is following a similar curve to Ireland's. All without shutting the economy down and forcing people to stay at home.  

I would imagine that the Swedish approach has also allowed the effects of herd immunity to increase as the virus passes through the general population. One thing which I think is worth noting is that they didn't close the schools or childcare facilities, thus making use of the most effective part of the herd - children, who are practically immune to any serious effects of Covid-19. 

Sweden have made either a very brave or very foolish decision. It is a massive gamble that has been taken to ensure the continuity of the economy, society and their way of life. And to date, it has paid off. Who knows how the picture will look in a few weeks  - will it be Europe left wondering why they panicked,  locked everything down and dragged their economies into recession, or will it be Sweden who'll regret leaving their citizens to fight against a virus as if they were antibodies in a gigantic petri dish?

###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

I'm really worried that people don't realize a novel virus makes the hop from animals to humans every few years (H1N1, Zika, SARS, etc etc).  Some are influenza strains, some are coronavirus strains, all have various degrees of severity.

Since we've had the technology to identify viruses, a ""serious"" one has hopped about once every 20 years, and there's nothing guaranteeing what hops in the future won't be even more virulent and deadly than the current coronavirus.  So there is a good chance the grandma in this post will have lived through at least 1 or 2 more pandemics on top of this one. 

Another fun thing to think about is climate change.  As weird weather pushes animal species out of their normal habitats, humans will have different levels of contact with different animals, which will lead to more chances for novel viruses to make the leap to humans, which will increase the odds of having more pandemics.

And then of course there's all the novel bacteria and viruses that have remained [locked in the frozen ice caps](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170504-there-are-diseases-hidden-in-ice-and-they-are-waking-up) for thousands of years, that no humans have immunity to... ice caps that are now melting...

So I sent her a couple emails to check in while she was in the hospital - at one point I offered to order her some Postmates so she could enjoy her favorite meal in the hospital, but she declined bc she said it was hard for her to eat - and then a week later she emailed saying she was out of the hospital, recovering at home, feeling much better, and ready to catch up on work.

Then they see a need for defense, worried about rioting, looting, and violence if Coronavirus throws us all into total chaos - perfectly valid worry - only to find that they're caught in their own snare, in the bills they supported meant to be employed against others.

I guess, think of it this way - someone scrolls past the Terms of Service of an ebay-like website, then wants to buy something from Taiwan. They are blocked or delayed in buying that item, and upon reading the ToS realize that though they thought they could buy anything from anywhere, they can't actually buy anything from Taiwan.

Let me address this first. You're absolutely right. Debt is at never seen before levels. However, quantitive easing to this extent is a relatively new phenomenon. The affects it'll bring about in the future is being left for that future generations to handle.

Economists themselves are at odds about how long this money printer can go brrrr. Answers range from ""Money is an arbitrary value which is assigned to fiat currency"" (very bad explanation in my book) to ""The effects will be within decades and it'll bring about great economic, political and social upheaval.""

>**keep stock market floating sky high for longer period**

Absolutely. The intent here isn't to stop the fall altogether, it's to ensure that the market doesn't crash all at once. That could unravel our entire financial ecosystem.

Also, there's optimism at play here as well. The pandemic is worldwide but it isn't equal. That's very important to remember.

Worldwide, China is already starting to open its borders and come into the world forum. (Can the Chinese be trusted with their numbers is another consideration altogether. But this is a hypothetical anyway,)

So the hope is that different countries pull out of the Coronavirus threat at varied time lines. Due to globalisation, the economy might not plummet to - 50% as previously suggested by experts. 

World market is at a 100, for instance. Covid19 dropped it to 80. But it should go to 60. Now QE comes into play. The market drops to 75 from 80 because Australia and NZ are in complete shutdown. However, because Japan and South Korea have fulled recovered and have amped up production. This causes the market to rise by 5 points. So all in all, the market stays at 80.

Hopefully the illustration makes it easier to comprehend."

* Here are some other graphs I'm playing with (MultiTrends): https://imgur.com/a/62xHRmE

This data is admittedly imperfect: testing is incomplete, there is a test backlog, and reporting is not completely fluid.  This is too simplistic a model for realistic projection, given all of the unknowns and variables of such a complex system.  That said, I'll continue to track this, to see where it goes.

Today's data notes:  

* Nationally, 1620 are hospitalized (+90 from yesterday), and 540 are in ICU (-19 from yesterday; I have no data on how many of ICU improved or died). As these numbers climb, the burden on our healthcare workers will increase. Godspeed and thanks to them as they stand on guard for thee and me. 
* 60 deaths today, 25 in QC, 22 in ON, 7 in AB. The national total is 569 (2.57% of known positives - this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed).
* People tested (+13,545) = 397,730 (1.06% of the population). This was about the same as yesterday, but still down from nearly 20K/day which we were seeing a week or 2 ago.
* Tested positive (+1383) = 22,148 (5.57% of those tested). The cumulative hit rate climbs from 5.40% yesterday, rising 17 days in a row. The higher hit rate is concerning, particularly in QC(9.9% overall, 15.8% today) and ON (6.7% overall, 13.3% today). More testing must be done to improve confidence in the latest numbers of positives. 
* Test backlog - total is 4769, down from 4966 yesterday. 
* Recovered = 6013 (27.15% of known positives).  NB passes 50% recovered (of known positives), joining BC, PEI, and YT. Nice! However, this proportion could regress for anyone with incoming positives.

* Known active = 15,566 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). The unknowns are unknown. 
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.
* The growth rate appears in cases seems to be slowing. Higher doubling time is better. March16 - doubling rate= every 2.84 days; March23=2.74 days; Mar30=4.21 days; Apr6=8.19 days.
* USA exceeded 500,000 positive cases today."

Mitigation was necessary. That said. The models keep pushing the numbers further and further down and it’s starting to get harder to justify the complete shut down of economies and life in general. And it’s become creepier that the general populace is becoming complacent with government handing out money to do nothing and accept less and less freedoms.

**By** [**ALICE SU**](https://www.latimes.com/people/alice-su)**CHINA CORRESPONDENT** 

**APRIL 10, 2020 10:18 AM**

BEIJING —  The COVID-19 pandemic has ignited a worldwide scramble for medical gear: masks, gowns, ventilators, testing kits, much of it made in China, which is attempting to recast its image as the source of the virus to the leader in the fight against it.

But that narrative is threatened by a major problem: quality control.

A growing list of foreign complaints about faulty medical gear and testing kits imported from China has upset Beijing’s designs. Within the last few weeks, scientists and health authorities in [Spain](https://seimc.org/contenidos/documentoscientificos/recomendaciones/seimc-rc-2020-Posicionamiento_SEIMC_diagnostico_microbiologico_COVID19.pdf), the [Czech Republic](https://www.praguemorning.cz/80-of-rapid-covid-19-tests-the-czech-republic-bought-from-china-are-wrong/), Slovakia, [Turkey](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-turkey-faulty-chinese-kits-not-use) and [Britain](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/06/government-seeks-refund-millions-coronavirus-antibody-tests/) have complained of faulty antigen or antibody coronavirus tests purchased from Chinese companies — in some cases, costing these governments millions of dollars.

Georgia has [canceled](https://agenda.ge/en/news/2020/953) a contract with the Chinese company that sent flawed test kits to Spain, and Malaysia has [opted](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2020/03/27/malaysia-to-test-south-korean-covid-19-test-kits-tonight/) to buy testing kits from South Korea instead of China because of the Chinese tests’ reported low accuracy rate.

Last week, the [Netherlands](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3077428/netherlands-recalls-600000-face-masks-china-due-low-quality) asked to return 600,000 face masks purchased from China that had inadequate filters and fit incorrectly. On Tuesday, [Finland](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finland_chinese_face_masks_fail_tests/11298914) tested a shipment of personal protective equipment, or PPE, from China and found the items unsuitable for hospital use. [Australian](https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-01/coronavirus-chinese-ppe-border-force-intercepted/12085908) border officials have also reportedly seized 800,000 faulty or counterfeit masks from China.

The problem is worse at home. On March 12, officials at a State Council press briefing announced that authorities had seized more than [80 million](http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/03/12/702723.html) counterfeit or faulty masks and 370,000 defective or fake disinfectants and other anti-coronavirus products in the prior month alone.

In some cases, defective masks have been reported after buyers purchase them online as a [donation](http://gaj.beijing.gov.cn/xxfb/jwbd/202002/t20200228_1670600.html) to Wuhan and other cities, only for medical staff to discover they can’t use them. China is trying to rein in its subpar PPE manufacturers. Authorities have detained dozens of counterfeiters and threatened those producing poor quality medical products with [life imprisonment.](http://www.xinhuanet.com/legal/2020-02/17/c_1125583856.htm)

Beijing has also [tightened export standards](http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/b/c/202003/20200302950371.shtml) in recent days, requiring domestic certification as well as foreign licenses for medical products shipped abroad. Previously, exported medical products only had to have the certifications in receiving countries, such as the European Union’s CE certification, which could be easily counterfeited in China.

But the desperation of states, nations, hospitals and individuals competing worldwide, shelling out millions of dollars to get medical gear as people die by the thousands each day, has created a scammer’s paradise.

“It’s a complete mess,” said Dan Harris, a lawyer whose firm Harris Bricken has advised companies on sourcing from China for more than 15 years. He called the current situation “unprecedented,” especially as frenzied Chinese suppliers attempt to recoup losses after months of quarantine.

“A year ago, Chinese companies were fine. Now they’re desperate,” said Harris. “A lot of them know they’re going to be bankrupt in a week. A lot are going to be bankrupt already. So they’re selling bad product, fake product” — and the whole world is buying those products, regardless of how they’re made.

Many of those calling Harris’ firm for help are hospital purchasing managers who are under pressure from overwhelmed doctors asking, “Where the hell are the masks?”

Then there are the middlemen, including experienced distributors and longtime sourcing agents who think it’s easy to shift into PPE. And a smattering of “crooks, who go to the hospital and say, ‘I can get you 5 million face masks’ … And they have no clue what they’re doing,” Harris said.

Meanwhile in China, many factories have pivoted into PPE manufacturing under government encouragement, even though they lack capacity and quality control.

“Everybody is jumping on this market and they have zero understanding of quality,” said Renaud Anjoran, a manufacturing supply chain auditor based in Hong Kong. “But these are high-risk items. If they don’t work, people might die.”

It’s common for Chinese suppliers to export a product under one licensed company’s name, but to source their products from second, third or fourth factories, like a chain of Russian nesting dolls, with little to no traceability down the chain of supply.

“In China, nothing is really black and white,” said Anjoran. “You have manufacturers selling you stuff they don’t really manufacture. They’re making it somewhere else, but you don’t know where.”

There are many ways medical product exporters could get away with counterfeited or substandard goods even with the certification requirements, Anjoran said: Certificates can be faked. Certificates can be real, but altered to display another manufacturer’s name.

Certificates can be valid, with goods made at the factory, but the manufacturer may not be checking the quality of its raw materials — especially the filter material in masks, the most important factor in protecting medical workers from the coronavirus. Testing filter material can take up to two weeks and cost more than $2,000.

“You’ve got speed and greed,” said Harris. “It’s perfect for con artists.”

Many of the newly set-up mask factories also operate in unhygienic conditions, with no process to keep the air clean, Anjoran said, based on his own auditing visits.

“But this is not even on the radar of most buyers these days,” he said. “They’re like, ‘But did you see the masks were dirty? No? OK, who cares! It’s going to save lives. Don’t be picky.’”

Testing kits also require careful buying. The World Health Organization has [listed](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/07-04-2020-who-lists-two-covid-19-tests-for-emergency-use) only two COVID-19 diagnostic tests for emergency use, both nucleic acid tests that use a slower, swab-based method to detect viral RNA.

The faulty rapid tests kits foreign governments bought from Chinese companies have all been [antibody tests](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-25/coronavirus-test-infected-recovered-covid19), which use blood samples to look for antibodies developed only a week or so into a person’s infection with the coronavirus, or antigen tests, which detect virus proteins.

But both kinds of testing are relatively new and not replacements for the nucleic acid tests — notably the antibody test, which is fast and can catch mild or asymptomatic cases in people who’ve already recovered from the coronavirus, but cannot determine whether a person currently has the coronavirus.

That’s why antibody tests should not be used for diagnosis, said Dale Fisher, chair of the WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. “At the moment, we’ve just got the PCR as a gold standard,” he said, referring to the nucleic acid tests. “Antibody tests are really for research, to help us understand the transmission dynamics.”"

I don't love Joe Biden as a candidate, but as long as coronavirus doesn't end up being an issue that suppresses voter turnout in November, he's set up decently well to win the electoral states he needs to against Trump. For example, if everything else stays the same on the electoral map aside from Biden winning Pennsylvania (his home state), Michigan, and Wisconsin, Biden wins. Those are all states that Clinton lost by less than 1% of the vote.

>When the federal government began rushing trillions of dollars of assistance to Americans crushed by the pandemic, the hope was that some of the aid would allow businesses to keep workers on the payroll and cushion employees against job losses.

>But so far, a staggering number of Americans — more than 16 million — have lost their jobs amid the outbreak. Businesses continue to fail as retailers, restaurants, nail salons and other companies across the country run out of cash and close up shop.

>There is a growing agreement among many economists that the government’s efforts were too small and came too late in the fast-moving pandemic to prevent businesses from abandoning their workers. Federal agencies, working in a prescribed partnership with Wall Street, have proved ill equipped to move money quickly to the places it is needed most.

>Flooded by requests for help like never before, a federal program that was supposed to deliver emergency relief to small businesses in just three days has run low on funding and nearly frozen up entirely.

>The initiative, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, is an expansion of an emergency system run by the Small Business Administration that has for years helped companies after natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes.

>But in the face of the pandemic, the loan program is drowning in requests. Many applicants have waited weeks for approval, and while the program is supposed to offer loans up to $2 million, many recent applicants said the S.B.A. help line had told them that loans would be capped at $15,000 per borrower.

>In a sign of how the coronavirus pandemic has changed the face of Congress, Representative Don Beyer, Democrat of Virginia, gaveled in a procedural session of the House on Friday morning wearing latex gloves and a brown cloth mask obscuring his entire face up to his eyes.

>“It’s not my normal look but we are not living in normal times,” Mr. Beyer said on Twitter, where he posted a screen grab from C-Span showing him on the House rostrum holding the gavel, a large American flag behind him, wearing the protective gear. “Those who would lead must do first by example.”

>Even as public health officials recommend that people wear masks to guard against transmission of Covid-19, Mr. Trump has said he is not interested in wearing one, telling reporters that he could not see himself sitting at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office in such equipment. “Somehow, I don’t see it for myself,” Mr. Trump said. “I just don’t.” (His wife, Melania, however, tweeted a picture of herself on Thursday wearing a medical mask and noting that the C.D.C. was advising people to cover their faces.)

>Mr. Beyer previously self-isolated last month as a precaution after possible exposure to someone with the coronavirus. He said the mask he wore on Friday, which had coffee filters inside, was made by his daughter. His decision to wear it reflected the concerns lawmakers have about returning to Washington for legislative business at a time when experts have recommended avoiding traveling or congregating in large groups.

>While Congress is scheduled to return on April 20, lawmakers in both chambers have  suggested in recent days that the meeting may get pushed back.

>Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, who oversaw the last procedural session in the House on Tuesday, took a similar precaution, wearing a black mask made by his 11-year-old daughter, Molly. Mr. Sherman did not wear gloves during his brief moments of presiding over the chamber.

>It led to chaotic scenes, heath jitters and long delays in Wisconsin on Tuesday after Republicans went to court to block the Democratic governor’s attempt to postpone its primary. Other states have postponed elections. And with many officials advocating voting by mail during the pandemic, Mr. Trump and some Republican are raising debunked claims about fraud.

>But the election now underway in South Korea highlights a very different approach.

>To make its voting run smoothly, South Korea has mobilized armies of public servants, including young men doing civic duty in lieu of mandatory military service, to prepare for its parliamentary elections. They have disinfected 14,000 voting stations across the country, and marked waiting lines at three-foot intervals so voters can avoid standing too close to one another.

>Millions of voters are taking advantage of early voting, ahead of the official election day next Wednesday. Anyone showing temperature readings higher than 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit) is supposed to be stopped at the gates of polling stations and escorted to a separate area to vote. The voter is then supposed to be sent for testing, and the voting booth disinfected.

>In Wisconsin, state health officials said Friday that they would track virus cases thought to be tied to this week’s balloting.

>The Wisconsin Department of Health Services said in a statement that there was “some risk” people had been exposed to the virus while voting or working at the polls.

>“We hope the extraordinary efforts taken by local clerks, public health, voters and poll workers helped minimize any transmission, but we stand prepared to respond if that isn’t the case,” said Andrea Palm, the state health secretary.

>If voters or poll workers contracted the virus, the first new cases will most likely start emerging next week, the department said.

>Wearing a face covering takes some adjustment. To get the most benefit, you need to wear it consistently and correctly. Here are some pointers."

> It’s indisputable that Iran, a country of around 83 million people, is one of the pandemic’s epicenters. Why exactly the crisis acquired such massive proportions in Iran is more complicated to address, but responsibility mainly lies with Tehran’s botched response, details of which are only now starting to come to light. There are growing indications that the Iranian government knew about the outbreak even as it avoided doing anything to stop it—or even inform the public about it. Meanwhile, the government’s judgment continues to be marred by a combination of cynicism and religious ideology.

Biden would be essentially a continuation of Obama — nothing very great, but at least not totally destructive, and opportunities for an organized public to change what is being done, to impose pressures.

All through Trump’s term, the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock, the best general assessment we have of the state of the world, moved closer to midnight — termination — reached the highest point ever. This January, it exceeded it. 

And the Republican Party, which is just monstrous, no longer qualifies as a political party. It simply sheepishly echoes everything the master says. Zero integrity. It’s just amazing to watch. He’s surrounded himself by a collection of sycophants who just repeat worshipfully everything he says. Real major attack on democracy, alongside the attack on the survival of humanity, to quote JPMorgan Chase again — the nuclear war, raising the threat of nuclear war, dismantling the arms control system, which has, to some extent, protected us from total disaster. It’s astonishing to watch.

**With a Biden presidency, there would be, if not a strongly sympathetic administration, at least one that can be reached, can be pressured. And that’s very important. Efforts made by working people to institute changes in the society, sometimes for themselves, sometimes for the society generally, succeeded when there was a tolerant or sympathetic administration, not when there wasn’t.** That’s a big — one of many enormous differences between Trump, the sociopath, and Biden, who’s kind of a pretty empty — you can push him one way or another. This is the most crucial election in human history, literally. Another four years of Trump, and we’re in deep trouble.

2020-04-10,IchbineinSmazak,China,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/fyqhqn/uns_partnership_with_tencent_at_odds_with_its/fn1aeev/,"As the coronavirus pandemic rages on with no end in sight, the United Nations has announced it will partner with Tencent to celebrate its 75th anniversary — via video conference.

The Chinese tech giant and the UN say they want to have online conversations with millions of people across the globe about what the world should look like in 25 years, and the role of international co-operation in solving global pandemics such as the coronavirus.

The company, which owns the Chinese superapp WeChat, has the biggest social media reach in China. Its video-conferencing platform Tencent Meeting has more than 10m daily active users, while VooV Meeting, the international version of Tencent Meeting, is now available in over 100 countries and regions around the world.

**But the UN’s partnership with Tencent has given privacy campaigners cause for concern. For one thing, it means sending global conversation data — at some points unencrypted, and so visible to Tencent — through a country known for its invasive line on privacy. Like other Chinese tech companies, Tencent is required to comply with requests for user data from the Chinese government. **

Beijing relies on the country’s tech giants to help clamp down on diverse voices. **In the initial stages of the coronavirus outbreak, Tencent censored information about the disease — a move that many argue may have limited the Chinese public’s ability to protect themselves from the disease**, which has now killed 3,335 people in the country.

The censored Covid-19 keywords covered a wide range of topics including factual information about the disease as well as both critical and neutral references to how the government handled the outbreak. 

Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party is bolstered by a deep arsenal of vague laws on which it can draw to compel companies to aid it, including its national intelligence law, national security law, counter-terrorism law and cyber security law.

Moreover, global tech giants have a history of handing over data to the Chinese government. In 2005, for example, a Chinese journalist was sentenced to 10 years in prison after Yahoo allegedly helped the Chinese authorities to track him down.

In recent weeks, the growing privacy woes surrounding the US video-conferencing platform Zoom have illustrated heightened concerns western countries have over the exposure of their data to China.

In the same week that researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab revealed that Zoom was transmitting keys for encrypting and decrypting global meetings to servers in Beijing, groups including Nasa, SpaceX, the Taiwanese government and the New York City public school system all banned the use of the service.

**The UN says that partnering with western platforms such as Google Hangouts or Facebook is not a viable option for its 75th anniversary, since the Communist Party blocks these services in China and the UN wants to reach as many people as possible.** But conceding to a censorship barrier and opting for a partner known to stifle debate feels at odds with the event’s premise of a “global dialogue”. 

Perhaps none of this may be of concern to an eager citizen of the world who wants to help mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations by sharing their views on climate change or gender equality.

But international co-operation is fundamentally political. Last month, the UN became embroiled in Chinese politics when a top official at the World Health Organization, a UN agency, was asked by a journalist about Taiwan’s WHO membership.

Taiwan has been praised by international experts for how its handling of the coronavirus outbreak has saved lives, but China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, has previously demanded that the UN exclude it from the World Health Organization on the grounds that it is not an independent state.

The official first refused to answer the journalist’s question, then appeared to hang up on the video call. It could be a portent of things to come."

This is the article:

>Russian spies are likely using the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to collect intelligence on U.S. supply lines, which have struggled to provide adequate medical equipment, according to an intelligence report issued earlier this week by the Department of Homeland Security and obtained by Yahoo News.

>The Russian intelligence services “likely are watching the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” says says an April 6 intelligence bulletin produced by the DHS Counterintelligence Mission Center.


>“Intelligence collection on medical supply chain vulnerabilities could inform future operations aimed at weakening key logistical elements in preparation for a wartime attack, or opportunistically during an emergency,” the document says.


>DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the report comes at a time when the U.S. has surpassed other countries in coronavirus cases, while also facing domestic concerns about shortfalls in medical supplies, particularly for personal protective equipment, or PPE, for health care providers. After weeks of delays, President Trump last month authorized the use of the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of equipment, including ventilators and N95 respirator masks.

>Moscow, in the meantime, has already scored some major public relations coups amid the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this month, Russia sent a planeload of medical equipment to the United States in what at first appeared to be a donation, though it was later revealed that the United States paid for supplies.

>On Friday, President Trump spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the coronavirus pandemic, the White House announced.

>Last month, Russia flew in plane loads of medical equipment and more than 100 personnel to Italy as part of what it describes a humanitarian mission. But La Stampa, an Italian newspaper, reported that Russian military intelligence officials were also on those flights.

>Michael Carpenter, managing director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, told Yahoo News he wasn’t surprised by the report’s claims, given how Russia operates. “Russian intelligence service is always probing vulnerabilities among adversaries. It’s not surprising even in the midst of a pandemic where they are supposed to be focusing on their own safety and health, they’re scrutinizing our supply chain vulnerabilities, our critical  infrastructure vulnerabilities and so forth,” said Carpenter, who previously served as a senior Pentagon official responsible for Russia.

>“This pandemic is essentially a war game of countries’ resilience, how command and control works, how governments respond rapidly,” he added.

>The unclassified DHS report notes that Russia has since January conducted a disinformation campaign related to the coronavirus epidemic. DHS also expects that Russia will use the current crisis as a way to improve its future information operations. 

>“We expect the Kremlin analyzes American public reaction to disinformation and adjusts techniques to maximize the impact both during the current COVID-19 situation and in the future, such as Russia’s ongoing 2020 election interference,” the report says.

>Daniel Hoffman, a retired CIA senior Intelligence Officer, said that Russia is using its propaganda to send a not so cryptic message to the U.S. government. ""The Russians are well aware that we know what our vulnerabilities are,"" he said. ""Implicitly threatening us, the Kremlin wants us to know they also know our vulnerabilities."""

I do not think the market is pricing in inflation as people seem to not understand that lack of access to credit has a deflationary effect. What the market is doing right now trying to find its actual value coming out of the crisis. The idea that everything is going to zero or fall like dominoes has been averted... for now anyway. In my incredibly humble opinion, we oversold based on the pessimistic unknown and are entering overbought territory based on an optimistic unknown. This is why you're going to continue to see pockets of 10% swings on some of the major companies based on seemingly nothing.

For example: There is zero realistic reason to be optimistic about Starbucks for Q2 of 2020. Sales are going to be way down. This is known. What is unknown is how Starbucks is going to look for Q3 and Q4 (they could be only down 20% year-over-year if the country/world is fully reopen come summer), if they're going to use Luckin Coffee's turmoil to expand their brand in China (which they should), and how consumer spending/behavior is going to shift as we enter the backside of the coronavirus curve. Optimistically speaking, Starbucks should remain a strong company, and you're buying their stock now because you expect consumer behavior in that sector to remain the same and 2021 to be more profitable factoring in the Luckin Coffee situation. You see how they performed last year, look at their stock price compared to six months ago, and say to yourself, ""well, it's still on sale."" Personally, they should still be at the \~30% haircut they were at, but volatility is fickle and Luckin threw them a bit of a lifeline.

In any case, this is not 2008. This is far, far different. 2008 was a slow, trickle down burn. This is a rapid shutdown, expected to be followed by a rapid startup. The question is more when than if, although the ""if"" factor could come into play the longer this drags on."
