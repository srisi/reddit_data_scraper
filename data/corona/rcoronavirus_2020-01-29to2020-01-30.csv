Anyone not showing symptoms they would send on to the continental US. 

I doubt there is any specific news because they were going to quarantine them for at least 3 days to start and these are mainly diplomats so information might be withheld more than if it was a random citizen. 

Best guesses:

1. they determined it would be better to isolate them on the military base, rather than into a populated area - just as a precaution to limit panic

2. At least 1 person showed symptoms on the flight and being on a plane increased chances of getting others sick so they decided the military base was the best place to take them to limit anyone's exposure.

So I bet it's either to limit panic or it's because they decided they needed to be more cautious."

The Wuhan government knew about cases as early as early December, but for some reason they waited it out, kept it hush hush (told doctors not to say anything just tell patients it’s regular pneumonia) and he didn’t decide to lockdown the city until January 23. Even after lockdown he didn’t call for help and have the central government send the city any medical supplies. 

Even if this virus is not that serious and just like the flu, it symbolizes, to many Chinese who’s come to the realization,  how shitty the Chinese government is and also the culture of fear and helplessness they created in their citizens. They don’t care about their citizens and will lie and censor to get a good public image...just like that fake city in North Korea across the border you can see in the demilitarized zone."

2. The virus is still relatively unknown. 

3. While much is unknown, it’s more lethal and more transmissible than other recent outbreaks. China wouldn’t quarantine 50 million for nothing. 

4. While the odds are low, there’s always the possibility that it mutates and becomes more lethal/transmissible 

5. Most countries are capable of handling the virus. However if it starts rapidly spreading beyond China, hospitals will be overrun and that’s when the real problems start. 

You shouldn’t freak out but it would probably be best to stock up on basic necessities. We’ll have to wait a few more weeks and see what happens. IMO the secondary/potential problems are worse than the virus itself"

Most jobs with high contact (think food service, retail) do not have ""sick days"" and plenty of places will require doctors notes from people who do not have insurance. 

I worked a 12 hour shift with a fever and barking cough because my employer would not send me home. I had extremely bad bronchitis (I went to the hospital after the shift) they gave me a breathing treatment, inhaler, medicine, codene, and a doctor's note. 

But in the scenario it took me peaking a fever and feeling like absolute death before I made the jump to go to the doctor. Despite my obvious infectious risk, my employer would not let me call out. 

Now imagine the scenario with something like the coronavirus. It's a disaster. 

I think the CDC has relied upon info they had at first (low h2h transmission, no asymptomatic carriers, and only Wuhan related cases) and an underestimation of how quickly things can spread here and the reasons behind that. 

Nevermind most people cannot afford to call out for what appears just to be a cold at first. Hell plenty of people won't even call out for the flu if they can stand it."

People usually mess this number up due to misinformation. For case mortality rates to be defined and calculated correctly, the reported values must fit the timeline in which mortality is possible. So say, 15 days at max. (Realistically it's more like 1 week)

If the reports come in that 6k people are infected as of today and only 132 people have died then this is incorrect in measuring case mortality rate for the disease, because the number of deaths lags the report of infection by 15 days, and thus must be reassessed in 15 days. Not many sources are reporting on when their measurements were taken or at what time intervals the deaths were included in but the mortality rate is probably closer to 1.5%. But who's counting.

Many homeless are *prevented* from getting active treatment and receiving care for hygiene. Homeless people are human beings. They just dont have a place to stay and are often stigmatized as brainless degenerates. It’s effectively how the city decides to handle the homeless problem that will solve public health crises, not the “go get em tiger” attitude that people like enforce on those who are helpless.

Plus they can’t “bring” it in. They’d have to contract it from the place it originated, which is Wuhan, China. If you’re telling me a homeless person brought in a virus from a different continent of their own accord, I’d not take you seriously. It’s more the people who do frequent air travel whom we should be worried about. Cramped conditions for long hours from people all over the world—regardless if we are assuming if they are hygienic or not—are on my radar. I say limit air travel for now and brace ourselves."

In the actual sense of overeating in any capacity could be detrimental, but I assume most readers eat to satisfaction if they have the means to. 

I’ve lived my entire adult life mostly eating fruits and veggies and have never been ill and I am strong and healthy. I weigh 215 pounds and can run a marathon in under four hours. So, I would beg to differ with you. 

To become strong like an ox you must eat what the ox eats. 

Balance is everything! An occasional steak is delicious, or a juicy burger from time to time tastes great!! But if this is your regular diet, I am sure you will benefit from more fruits and vegetables.

A cohort is a specific set of individuals say, that move through the entire cycle front to back.  After all have completed the process, you can accurately determine frequencies of different results and qualities along the way.

We’re only seeing bulk numbers for whatever reason. The first study we all saw here was of the cohort of the first 41 cases, and it did in fact have a 12%+ fatality rate as well. (Someone post the link please? :) ).

Cohorts are also a way to understand how the virus changes over time 

So, we’ll see what the ratios are once the WHO or local bodies starts releasing cohort data.

Also, i don’t expect we’ll have real numbers until Hong Kong, or other free people’s scientists have enough data."

Hear me out. 
Every nation/culture has its own preferences. In western world (America, EU) we eat cows but Indians do not. Hence for Indians we are treating animals inhumanly. Heck...they would senteces us to some serious jail time. 

Same is with China. We do not tolerate eating bats, snakes etc but they do. IMHO If meals/animals are prepared according to healh standards there is nothing to wory. 

The problem is there are too many poor people in China and there is higher probability to found some person who would not take care of health precotions while buying/preparing food. Same as everywhere in the world except —>higher populatiins—> higher probability to found “idiots”. 

From my point of view is really unfair that you blame whole nation.

Aside from the fact that most people doesn't seem to remember, but China is a very populous country so the amount of people plus the contagious power of the virus will make the infected raw numbers look absurd when its just a very small portion. Relax."

And the health control they are doing on airports is said to be terrible, I cannot myself confirm this but I have not seen one positive opinion from people that stated they just came back from China.

There was a case where a person went to hospital 1, got rejected, went to hospital 2 and also got rejected, and while going to hospital 3 the hospital 2 realized that they fucked up big time and sent an ambulance to get the patient.

Im pretty sure it was confirmed she is clear, but how do they confirm that without waiting for the incubation time to pass? Dunno."

Just dont let people cough/sneeze on you and make sure to not touch your face or scratch your eyes unless you just have washed hands, u'll be safe then.

Even if, unless you have an actual reason to be vulnerable like an operation you just had (or old age or smfin) then there is a really high probability that even if you would get it, u'd survive with the proper medical attention.

And looking at it from the perspective of an actual pandemic  
it is definetely better to get infected now if you are a healthy guy, because you will get cured in the country you're from, you get all the medical attention ur body will need to fight off the virus.

but if you get it when the whole city gets it, you might not get that hospital bed because its already taken.

Super negligent & it’s putting the public’s health at risk further.

Because then say you get infected, you don’t even realise it and go speak with a friend. They then contract the virus and you show symptoms, that friend then goes back to their family etc. I’m in no ways saying that’s what will happen but this is how this kind of virus spreads. If I were in your situation personally I wouldn’t risk it, especially seeing as this trip is unimportant. Obviously it comes down to your choice but if you do decide to go, there’s no harm in wearing a mask (people seem to be recommending N95 but there’s an international shortage, I’m no expert though so can’t really recommend, just repeating what I’ve read). You should also consider wearing goggles as the infectious droplets can be contracted through the eyes, a hat/coat/gloves and scarf won’t hurt either, think of plague doctors, they had the right idea (I know in their case it was fleas, yadda yadda). Another thing I’ve READ (remember I can’t confirm any of this) is that the virus can survive on a surface for up to five days, meaning if a contagious person sneezed on a rail, that rail is highly contagious for five whole days.

Repeating once more these are things I’ve read and as I’m not an expert cannot confirm, just sharing what I’ve read, no harm in taking precautions <3"

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1)

""The 41 patients in this cohort developed severe dyspnoea and required admission to an intensive care unit, and six patients died. Hence, the case-fatality proportion in this cohort is approximately 14·6%, and the overall case fatality proportion appears to be closer to 3% ([table](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30185-9/fulltext#tbl1)).  However, both of these estimates should be treated with great caution because not all patients have concluded their illness (ie, recovered or died) and the true number of infections and full disease spectrum are unknown. Importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. As further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available, one case of which was documented by Chan and colleagues,the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease. Nevertheless, the 1918 influenza pandemic is estimated to have had a case-fatality ratio of less than 5% but had an enormous impact due to widespread transmission, so there is no room for complacency.""

&#x200B;

Regarding R0:

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1)

""We estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (R\_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 February (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent.""

Not correct, except for the part about it works like a flu virus.  Flus/viruses take out young, healthy people every year - but they do have a better chance of surviving the disease than the very youndg old or those with compromised heath.  At any rate, being young & healthy doesn't make a person immune from either catching the illness or dying from it. Like I said, they just have a better chance of making it through:

However the mutation often does not significantly alter the strength of the virus. It can also increase rather than decrease the severity. Also to note is that a person with a weaker strain mutation is essentially patient zero for the “new strain”. That means that it will be a tiny fraction of the total cases (given that by the time it infects 1000 people in a month, the main strain would have infected over 100 million). 

Your second statement is also false. Humans DO gain immunity AFTER they have had the disease. We don’t magically gain immunity without being exposed to the disease."

This can include the place of treatment not even acknowledging a person is being treated or is even present at a healthcare facility. I don’t know if any of those laws get bent in pandemic situations. 

Also, quarantine is the first step...they are being quarantined. It makes sense the US wants their citizens on their soil so they can be monitored “in house.” We could glean a lot more info that way, and besides it’s super cold in Ontario anyway. 

The second step— if any peeps are positive for Coronavirus— would be, at best, further isolation and fluid resuscitation. There are currently no other [proven effective] treatment options that I’m aware of, besides life support if they go into ARDS or MSOF. So basically, all that needs and has to be done is being done and done discreetly to help promote calm.

It is devastating for some people to “not know.” I am one of those people. I’ve seen every propaganda video China has put out, but also every stray video showing healthcare workers struggling to keep working under the worst of conditions with little to no resources. (People laying dead, convulsing, waiting in long lines). 

I think the WHO conference video released this a.m. shows China is trying and more determined than ever to get things back under control. They don’t have a choice but to share info and accept help, or things will spiral out of control in Wuhan and the other provinces. 

Does that mean every person working at a high level made perfect decisions through this pandemic? No. But all nations seem to be on the same page and willing to work together to implement strategies to contain the virus. Everyone is doing their best."

Yes. International gatherings of that magnitude should just be cancelled while we see what happens the next few weeks.

Also... Brazil has relatively few Chinese tourists and residents who would have been to China recently (compared to USA / Canada etc.)

So if the contagion is worst case scenario, we've got a bigger time buffer than most, but in mid-late Feb it would be exactly the time for the disease to be carried unknowingly by thousands of Americans / Europeans / etc.

A cultural difference is that some places feel masks cause fear and therefore cause long line ups at hospitals. So in order to keep fear low they want people to not wear masks for example in schools. 

In fact a Member of the WHO today said masks are ineffective was himself wearing a mask when he said it. 

Carrie Lam Chief of Hong Kong implemented a face mask ban in order to identify protestors in Hong Kong had her ban lifted by the surpreme court and then this week with a state of emergency wearing a mask herself told everyone to be safe and even banned mainland people from crossing into Hong Kong. 

Mask have big cultural difference in France I heard most people do not wear masks. Perhaps due to must show face in public legislation. But at what cost? 

So back to if masks make a difference. The answer is yes they do. Just how much is the question."

"" ...new coronavirus infections start off much like many other less dangerous diseases. Initial symptoms are fever, dry cough, myalgia (muscle pain), and fatigue. Productive cough (a cough that produces phlegm) and headache are infrequent, hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and diarrhea occasional. It can take about a week before an infected person feels sick enough to seek medical care.

After this deceptively slow start, the disease progresses rapidly during the second week—in a similar fashion to SARS. Hypoxemia caused by increasing lung injury leads to difficulty breathing and the need for oxygen therapy. ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) is a common complication. Between 25 and 32 percent of cases are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation and sometimes ECMO (pumping blood through an artificial lung for oxygenation)."""

Friend of mine has 20,000 of the N95 masks in his warehouse (paint supply business).  I think he told me yesterday his cost on them was  $0.40 CAD for the valveless and $0.95 CAD for the ones with a valve.  They are currently selling up up to $20/mask here.

The flu kills a lot of people every year. This has more to do with fear of the unknown. With the flu, it’s expected, it happens every year, we already have vaccines that mitigate the issue. 

There are two main concerns with this virus that make it different. 

First, we do not have a vaccine. That means everyone is susceptible, as far as we know. Imagine if the flu happened for the first time and no one was vaccinated against its spread. In 2012 the vaccine had an estimated efficacy of 67%. 45% of the population was vaccinated in 2012. Flu related deaths from 2010 to 2016 were 12k to 56k. So about half the people someone with the flu virus encountered were vaccinated and 2/3 of those people would have been protected (I think that’s how it would work?). With coronavirus, every single person that comes into contact with the virus could potentially get infected. That means it will spread more easily. 

Second, the incubation period from infection to showing symptoms is anywhere from a week to two weeks. It appears that the virus is contagious before symptoms show (not sure what the specific timeline is).  That means infected individuals will be in public with freedom of mobility and the potential to travel long distances before any precautions are taken. 

As it stands, it is currently a big question mark. It’s an emergency in China and a serious concern elsewhere. It’s not necessarily worse than the flu, but because of the above two points has the potential to spread more easily and infect more people."

All passengers should be screened, but at the moment we can provide an additional layer of screening to people arriving from the PRC.  If we shut down all flights from the PRC all people in the PRC who wish to return to Canada are going to be forced to do it from a third country, and will probably do their best to disguise their origin as well.  If we try and apply that extra layer of screening to all incoming passengers from all nations the system will quickly be overwhelmed.  As it is right now we can focus on passengers arriving from regions where the risk of infection is high.

Also - contrary to your assertion, only two major airlines (British Airways and United) have cancelled their flights to China and that has only come to pass in the last six hours or so.  While I fully expect more to follow suit, I think it may take some time and I don't think they will take the form of a national ""ban"" per se.  With that said, if the US closes their airspace to flights originating in China I would expect Canada to follow suit - in this instance we will probably take our lead from our neighbours to the south."

But here's the explanation that I head in one of the WHO Meetings (they actually say a lower mortality than 14-15%

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0bw5RkFlrc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0bw5RkFlrc)

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext#seccestitle180](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext#seccestitle180)

Summary: The 14% mortality is among those that develop the ""severe"" form of the illness. And about 30% of all infected, develop the severe form. 

The overall mortality is probably a lot lower than you can even calculate from numbers given in the public domain, because we don't really know how many were or are infected with minimal or no symptoms. Later one, with population studies, that overall mortality may turn out to be very low.

Overall interpretation  (and this is my opinion and i'm a physician, but remember nobody is an expert, because nobody knows anything about this virus! Take it as mental rambling!): 

The main problem with the virus is that being a new virus, nobody in the whole planet is immune to it. The other problem is that it's spreading fast (high transmissibility). The number of 2019-CoV virus infections since the beginning of this epidemic already exceed the number of people that got SARS in all its history.

Being new virus, also, we don't know the natural history of the disease. We really don't even know the true incubation period (it's taken to be around 14 days) and we don't know if patients remain infectious even after they're clinically ""healed"" (as is the case of ebola: semen of a healed man can transmit the disease for months).

So my overall understanding is that the authorities are being cautious in protecting populations from a large epidemic of a new virus that may kill a lot of people and at least temporarily incapacitate (or isolate) others.

Because even if it's 2% lethal, and it infects 60 million (and that's only a small fraction of the world population), it means it kills 1.3 million people....and the attempts to contain it paralyzes the economy. Even without being infected, it has paralyzed multi-million population cities in China and the economy that depends on them. And none of this is trivial at all."

Second, while the situation in China is pretty bad, it's not something to globally panic about at this point.  It's essentially a really bad flu and it is not an automatic death sentence if someone has it.  While it can affect anyone, those with compromised immune systems are at most risk, most deaths being elderly.

Just follow standard sanitary habits; cover your mouth, wash your hands, keep hand sanitizer on you, avoid sharing food/drinks, etc.  Just keep track of where confirmed cases are popping up and keep a calm head, you'll be ok :)"

It serves no purpose. Percentages would be much better. But i guess if you want to get a logarithmic distribution this is the best choice.

I'm siding with the theory that it was weaponized, and accidentally escaped.

Obviously, there is limited info here, but there is some evidence of this being a Frankenstein assembled version of a coronavirus."
