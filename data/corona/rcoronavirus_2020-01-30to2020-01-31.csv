It disabled me by damaging tendons and nervous system and turns out I didn't even have an infection. I have problems getting over things now. I couldn't even  sue because I was given the generic version on Cipro, Ciprofloxacin and generic drug makers can't be sued in the US. I struggle to walk and have extremely limited stamina and have to rest often. There has been no help for me. They treated me like I didn't matter. They took most of my life away. I can't work.

Without a doubt some right now see this as some for of entertainment. But the problem is we can all see dodgy information. The U.K. is going to quarantine the people from Wuhan for 14 days. Yet has been letting in flights from Wuhan for two weeks during the outbreak with hardly a check. 

That makes no sense and only heightens fears that when they let people for two weeks, they are basically admitting they should have been quarantined. So there is nothing to suggest the kung flu isn’t on a sightseeing tour of London right now. 

Kazakhstan, Thailand and China threatening five and seven years in jail for anyone posting to social media. Even videos of what’s actually happening. That is fucked up to say the least. It’s not containing rumours is fuelling them. We have a right to talk to each other and sift through the bullshit ourselves. We arent stupid. 

Indonesia not one case yet. They have been letting people in without hardly even a temp screen. Unless you’re leaving a trail of blood behind you it’s fine.  Not one case ? That makes no sense for Wuhans tenth biggest destination. 

Is there fear ? Yes some people are scared. We aren’t scared in the U.K.  but I have been asked if babies will be effected by worries mother’s. 

what I am good at is deciphering bullshit and getting to the truth or at least close to it. And whilst the world is probably well over due a pandemic, if it comes it comes. People deserve information and as best knowledge they can to decide what to do. And right now that ain’t  coming from our governments. 

We are all born equal. All born under one sun and we all have the right to say what ever we please. And if people are scared. Then fine they are scared. We should welcome them and hopefully give as best information as we can figure out right now.

I'm not exactly sure why people keep looking at death number but death number isn't the only problem when it comes to virus. There are other factors.

For one, you have to see the infection rate that leads to a severe case. Influenza, for an example, had a spread rate of up to 1-2 people. This virus has a spread rate of up to 5+ people. That's a **very** high number of spreading rate and mean it can travel extremely fast if an outbreak were to occur. Now you're going to say, who cares? we probably won't die and just have cold symptoms. Wrong. If the infection rate were to spread that fast, that means a high number of treatment will be needed at the same time. The reason why the case in China is so serious is because of so many people getting infected extremely fast. The infection rate in China is currently multiplying by x4. It was at 2000 yesterday and now it jumped up to 8000 today. With this many amount of people being infected in such a short amount of time says something. First, when you get infected, you start developing symptoms. When you develop symptoms such as high fever, you need treatment. When you need treatment, you go to a hospital. If you don't receive treatment, your case has a very high chance of becoming severe and that's when this virus becomes **deadly**. Severe case with this virus can cause pneumonia, organ fail, stroke, and death. Nobody wants a virus to become severe. So now imagine up to 8,000 people being infected in one city and the number multiplying by double in just 24 hours. How many people do you think a hospital can hold? The biggest problem is, they will have to continuously take in new patients while simultaneously treat the ones already in. This is the biggest problem in China right now as every hospital are jammed packed and people can't even get treated. It's so bad that emergency call in China doesn't even work. People with problems that isn't related to the virus can't even see a doctor. This is the type of problem that can happen if an outbreak were to occur in other countries. It isn't about the death rate. It's really about containing outbreak and avoiding stuff like this."

1) The virus isn't currently an emergency for Western nations which have strong healthcare systems (because of China's drastic response to contain the spread of the virus) , the concern or emergency is for countries with less developed healthcare systems who might not be equipped to control the spread or treat large numbers of people and   


2) Their constant praising of China makes it seem like WHO and the international community really wants continued cooperation with them, maybe for research/data sharing purposes.  


I'm not an expert, but to me it seems like it's REALLY bad in parts of China at the moment, maybe due to a large number of variables, and it COULD get really bad elsewhere, even in the West, but as long as appropriate measures are taken it won't become some world ending pandemic."

Happens every year. We can know the flu exists and simultaneously be worried about a new virus which is spreading exponentially faster over time. It's not a one or the other thing, but since you asked:

1. The virus has spread from like 1500 cases to almost 10k confirmed in one week. 

2. 1/6th of cases result in severe condition for the patient.

3. 200+ people have died. About a 2% death rate.

4. None of the rates I just mentioned include the fact that the virus in the past 3 days alone has had an increase of 3700 confirmed cases. Most of those people obviously haven't had enough time to truly develop serious symptoms from the virus, but many of them likely will. Most of those people also haven't had time to die, and so the death rate will seemingly be much higher than 2%, as will the % of severe cases.

5. The virus has shown it can pretty easily spread to other people, and has hit 18 countries now iirc.

6. The confirmed cases does not take into account the number of cases that inevitably aren't confirmed or even suspected yet, since it can be transferred without any symptoms.

7. We know basically everything about the flu and how to deal with it. This is a new virus and we have no cure and hardly know anything about it.

8. We aren't replacing the flu with this. We are adding it on top of it."

Beyond the virus itself you've got major companies closing offices and business, airlines canceling hundreds of flights, investors pulling out for fear of losses, etc, so the market is taking a hit.  We could very well see a shift in where cheap goods are manufactured and where jobs and factories and whatnot are outsourced.

Add to that the humanitarian crisis that that the quarantined cities are quickly devolving into.  FIFTY MILLION stranded in their cities with dwindling food supplies, and freedom.  Refugees who fled before the lockdown and now have nowhere to go and are being ostracized.  Business in bordering countries not permitting mainland Chinese through their doors, with signs dictating such.  Learning more and more about how China bungled this and hid it not only from the world but their own citizens, lying to them to maintain the illusion of control and stability.

Imagine the fear and panic that will set in when there is no food at the grocery store or gas at the stations, power is coming on and off, emergency responders and hospitals are inundated, etc. 

Stock up on supplies ASAP. Because you’re right, the greater danger is social, political, and economic collapse. Waiting until it’s a full blown emergency, it will be too late.

...with literally nothing we can do about it except testing/ quarantining people based on travel and contact, not waiting for symptoms. (Hint: no country is doing that).

That is just the US, China and its citizens own property, securities, and other financial instruments across the world. That is how a global economy works.

In an effort to contain the novel coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have suspended air, road, and rail travel in the area around Wuhan and placed restrictions on travel and other activities throughout the country.

2020-01-30,Virgil_F,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewck3v/fake_news_needs_to_end/fg1o7k6/,"I cant argue that there is no fake news going around.

I cant argue that there are reposts of people who allcaps headlines of some article but don't read it fully

And i cant argue that there are no re-uploads of older videos (not just from this month, but of several years old) that have some scary/crazy things shown with chaina people in it with a title and description saying its something that its not.

But even if i (or anyone else) don't look up sources, even if we ignore videos of pack full hospitals, medical staff screaming and crying out of exhaustion and fear, dead covered bodies...

Even if we ignore ""eye witness citizen reporters"" reports, and ignore videos of people being locked up in their buildings and their apartment doors being barred shut with iron pipes and wooden planks...

One has to stop and think about the ""official"" reports and news.

* 3 months ago event 201 had a simulation on a virus epidemic with Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in New York.
* Some of the things they were talking on that simulation happened, i think the most recent one is to control the information spreading on the internet. Twitter announced a few days ago they will regulate what news is right and what is wrong.  
Remember when there was a huge deal when google, facebook, youtube was exposed on how they regulate the content that is released on their platforms based on their political and add friendly views? Well this seems to be an even bigger deal.  
Imagine you wanting to post something and share with your friends (and essentially with the world) but it gets removed because the company thinks its fake news- regardless if its fake or not)
* Unfortunately for all of us, the outbreak also happened during the lunar new year, a time where millions and millions of foreigners and china residents travel all over the country.  
For most chinese people, their new year can be compared in a way with the muslim mecca pilgrimage. Its not religious, but everyone ""feels"" like they must go (home )and spend the time with their family, to a point where its the time that has most thefts on cars, motor bikes, bicycle and such.
* China has a long history of censorship, hunting down and punishing their own people for trying to expose some light on issues in their country.
* There is 1 lvl 4 biological research lab in china and it just happen to be extremely close to wuhan, the place where the outbreak started fro
* For a billion people country, with 11 million people in wuhan city, they decided to completely barricade the city, and shortly after the entire province of 50-60mill people because (officially) a few thousand people got sick and a 2 digit number of them died from a new virus.  Seems a bit extreme? If not, then it must be quite serious right?  
Yet the WHO continues to praise that move, and during the last conference when they announced an international state of emergency ,couldn't stress enough how great china handled the situation from the start.
* Multiple countries close their borders and lock down transport to and from china. And not just the neighboring countries.
* WHO declared the global state of emergency. So it must be serious right?
* Stock markets are starting to fluctuate
* Official reports in a lot of countries saying tourism agencies,  travel, residence and holiday bookings are drastically going down, in some cases even from 70-100%  down till april (singapore)

So yeah, i do agree, some fake news are spreading, and some conspiracy theories are showing up.

But looking at real official news and coming to a conclusion something is really wrong is as easy as 1+1=2.

Imo, most of the world citizens shouldn't panic at all, but at this point should absolutely take precautions, and prepare them selves and their family with some extra supplies and medicine."

Let’s say 100k have it in China. That means that **99.99993%** of the population there does **not**. 

But sure, let’s freak out about everyone from China and self sabotage our global economy. 

Just... relax. Get a flu shot if you haven’t, and get in the habit of washing your hands often and thoroughly. That’s what you should be doing anyway."

That’s what has made these “Forever Wars” in the ME so difficult to manage. This could be so devastating because the enemy we should be fighting isn’t necessarily the one we might encounter.

Other countries were only checking people that had direct ties to the epicenter. So say if you were feeling sick and hadn't  recently been to Wuhan you were most likely going to get dismissed. However reports in Germany, Japan and South Korea prove H2H infections are starting to ramp up pretty quickly, so now they need a more proactive approach.

We already know a single asymptomatic superspreader can infect 5+ people, so whenever a new H2H infection happens it has the possibility of spiralling more and more out of control if they fail to identify it."

You don't know whether a sick person will die or not. The whole point of the death rate is to project that value onto the people infected, not the other way around. The death rate would be self defining and meaningless. 

To get an accurate death rate you have to take a sample size of infected people and document how many die and divide that by the total number of infected, but only *after* the virus has run its course, aka after everyone is either cured or dead. Otherwise your equation isn't doing anything, it's just saying how many people have died relative to all the infected as of the time you decided to record it. 

By the logic of your equation you could just pick a random number of infected people of ANY disease before anyone dies and claim that the death rate is 0%."

On another note, in the very beginning, when only china was infected and they were speculating on how it spreads.

The general idea was that it spread trough some sort of animal contact, mainly from eating food from those wet markets.

Some even speculated a bat infected a snake and then someone eat a snake and got sick.

But soon after that people were talking about people not being anywhere near the wet market, or using such food (there are plenty of ""proper"" grocery shops and super markets around).

Eventually other countries starter reporting infected people, and then others started to show up who were ""nearby"" the area of the reported infected person- confirming the virus spreads from human to human."

Regular flu for example kills about 10% of hospitalized people.

If this virus is as contagious as current estimates are, then it is very likely it has infected lot more people in Wuhan then has been shown by current data."
2020-01-30,Virgil_F,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ewhhhr/harvard_university_professor_arrested_for/fg2fkpp/,"My theory is that a world renown chinese biology researcher had the idea to research bats in wuhan and how they are able to be infected with tons of viruses but never show any symptoms.

How it ties with america and canada and things that happened before this point i don't know.

Then at one point, somehow ,some infected bats escaped ,went into the wild, infected other things like snakes and somehow got in contact with the wuhan people.

[source](https://www.zerohedge.com/health/man-behind-global-coronavirus-pandemic) that i base my theory on.

TLDR:

1. One of China's top virology and immunology experts was and still **works at China's top-rated biohazard lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which some have affectionately called** [**the real Umbrella Corp**](https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/real-umbrella-corp-wuhan-ultra-biohazard-lab-was-studying-worlds-most-dangerous-pathogens)**.**
2. Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world.
3. His primary field of study is researching **how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick.**
4. He was genetically engineering various immune pathways ([such as the STING pathway in bats](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323347216_Dampened_STING-Dependent_Interferon_Activation_in_Bats)) to make the bats more or less susceptible to infection, **in the process potentially creating a highly resistant mutant superbug.**
5. As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; **these are ""superbug"" Coronavirus strains, which are not resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild.**
6. As of mid-November, his lab was actively hiring inexperienced post-docs to help conduct his research into super-Coronaviruses and bat infections.
7. Peng's work on virology and bat immunology **has received support from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology.**

Edit: At this point its just a theory that seems interesting, and has some nice documentation and ""timing"" that kinda fits with the theory.   
To be honest i don't think there is time to witch hunt right now and people should focus on other things"

Common cold virus (which is also a coronavirus) can last “a couple hours to maybe a couple days,” depending on temperature, humidity, and other factors. The viruses can sometimes survive on indoor surfaces for more than 7 days. In general, viruses survive for longer on non-porous (water resistant) surfaces, such as stainless steel and plastics, than porous surfaces, such as fabrics and tissues.

Packets and goods from China usually take several weeks to arrive, so even if infected person was handling it and some viruses ended up on the surface, chances of the virus surviving is extremely small, practically zero."

Everyone here is already hypersensitive on the subject and are panicked it's going to get big globally. I agree, there will be fewer than 100 U.S. cases (not that I don't care about other countries, just that I need to use an easily-accessible metric and I already know about the first 6 cases here). I suspect less than 2 U.S. deaths will occur (of course I hope for none).

The main danger, imo, is the panic. Every person with a cough or sniffle in China will rush to the hospital (assuming they can even get transportation). Emergency services are already almost unobtainable in Wuhan. Arriving healthy to a hospital packed with people is pretty much going to guarantee the spread of the disease. Under-staffed hospitals cannot handle the I flux of people so those who are actually sick won't get proper care, increasing the death toll.

Mathematically if the majority of the population gets infected let's say 50% is 3.7 billion.  Then at a lethality rate of 2% 74,000,000 will die.  To put into perspective, the US would have roughly 3,272,000 die. 

50 isn't ""old"" but there are 108,000,000 people over 50 in the US.  The normal flu has a lethality rate of 1 in every 1000. Coronavirus currently has a lethality rate of 1 in 50.  

Here's the thing, unless the Coronavirus infects like the swine flu did, it's not going to be that big of a deal.  If it does infect at the same rate swine flu did, it'll be a very big deal, but still half of the entire globes population is so improbable.  Swine flu and Spanish flu were insanely infections and it never went over 33% of the population.

Walk in your apartment, take off clothes put them straight in washer/plastic laundry bag, go to restroom and thoroughly wash your hands and face, or just jump in the shower. Then go put on clean clothes. Wash your dirty clothes on hot water and a hot dryer. So essentially, have a dirty side (outside) and a clean side (apartment) and try not to let them interact. If you have a purse/briefcase you should wipe it down when you bring it in your door.

When we examine things like viruses and bacteria we use Logarithmic curves (log phase of growing pathogen) to show based on data what the growth of infected would be if there were no actions taken to stop the growth (i.e. vaccines, quarantine). We can see from both bacterial cultures and past viral infections that eventually the exponential curves even out after time due to many factors. Basically the Logarithmic curve shows a pathogen starting out super fast and gaining large numbers of infected super quick and then slowing down as the pathogen either can't infect more people and dies out or outside factors slow it down like science. If you go on Google and look up ""Logarithmic curves viruses"" you'll get a nice visual of what I mean along with how factors affected those curves."

Also, if the WHO didn't praise them China would be less likely to assist them with more data now and in the future. Not that they already aren't hiding cases and deaths.  It's literally just China throwing their weight around to not be embarrassed for their obvious failure. Imagine if the Chinese people found out their government can actually fail horribly and their president isn't in fallible? The risk of having their own people think of wanting different leaders scares the hell out of the CCP. The WHO is very influenced by politics whether people think it is or not."
