The lockdown was announced by Chinese government during the flight, several hours after the takeoff. So basically passengers didn’t know anything about the lockdown before landing Sydney.

Back then it was not clear that the virus is contagious even during incubation period (other coronavirus like MERS and SARS are only contagious after symptoms show up). I guess that’s why the Australian government allowed passengers left the airport after checking their body temperature. 

It is a new virus and a tricky one.

For most people, it’s just flu like symptoms, which are more severe for the elderly because of their weaker immune system. HOWEVER, and that’s the scary part, why it triggers pneumonia in some but not others is not yet known. From exiting cases and the article published by The Lancet, it doesn’t seem like the weak or the elderly is more likely to have pneumonia triggered. 

Also the type of pneumonia that is triggered is closer to an immune response than normal pneumonia. This is why with the coronavirus, pneumonia is found on both lungs rather than one lung for normal pneumonia. Simply put, it’s the patient’s own immune system attacking their lungs that’s causing the pneumonia. 

This would imply that stronger, healthier people would suffer more from the pneumonia once it’s triggered, although we do not know why it is triggered in the first place. Also why AIDS medication seems to work a bit on the pneumonia patients."

# Statement about nCoV and our pandemic exercise

In October 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted a pandemic tabletop exercise called [Event 201](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/)  with partners, the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda  Gates Foundation. Recently, the Center for Health Security has received  questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current  novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health  Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop  exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic,  but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the  exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that  would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting  that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people. Although our  tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used  for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not  similar to nCoV-2019."

With an incubation period that long, just banning travel from China isn't enough.  There are already multiple infected people in multiple other countries, who don't know they are infected, infecting other people.

By the time they start showing symptoms, they have infected many of the other people they came into contact with during that time.

An infected person flies from China to Dubai or Delhi, infects dozens of other people on the plane or in the airports, and they go on to infect dozens or hundreds more - and it is a week or 10 days before the first person even figures out they are sick."

The Guardian is the only media outlet citing this figure from Ferguson, as far as I can tell. Neither was it a direct quote from him saying ""I think there are 100,000 cases worldwide""; the Guardian quoted him indirectly. I am inclined to treat this with a pinch of salt for now, but if Ferguson repeats it to another outlet in the coming days, then fair enough. He's the expert who's dedicated his career to epidemiology, not me.

> Hello everyone

> I hope everyone who is watching this can cherish this video.

> Because it is very difficult to post anything online right now.

> In mainland China, well, you know, we need VPN and all kinds of stuff, and there's severe Internet latency.

> So I've got no other choice but to seek help from here.

> Hope there's Chinese comrades and people with kindness can watch this, and be aware about this Wuhan Pneumonia, so called ""Coronavirus"" pandemic.  The severity of the situation, and the actual living condition of us Wuhan people.

> Right now the entire Wuhan has its entire transportation system, public transport halted, all of them.  For example, gas stations are no longer in service.

> And I've had a few questions, for example, perhaps one of your family members has something like a high blood pressure condition or heart attack, and needs to go to the hospital immediate.  How do we do that?  Calling the emergency hotline 120, you can try it, it simply doesn't get through.  Just doesn't get through at all.  Always busy.

> Another example, you suspect that you might have contacted the pneumonia, you go to the hospital to get checked, but you can't get there at all.  Hospitals are packed.  The doctors don't tell you to get registered or anything, you just have to line up.  You might have to wait hours in line and still can't get treated.  Perhaps you were fine before, but after queueing up for hours, you get contaminated.

> And then I'm going to talk about something I saw with my own eyes.  One day before the day Wuhan is locked down, as well as before (January) 22nd, in the entire city of Wuhan, there weren't much people wearing masks.  There were just a bunch of people waking around, playing mah-jong, chitchatting everywhere, interacting with street vendors.  I've got a question for us to discuss in this public platform:  What the hell had the Wuhan mayor and the Party committee secretary been doing?

> As a local government official, did they not receive any information?  If they had indeed received any first-hand information, why did they not take any action?  For the entirety of the press conference, why did they not urge us to immediately put on a mask?  To at least increase our public health awareness?  If he did not receive any information, then he has neglected his duty, and he simply isn't fit for a job of a local government official, and should have been sacked a long time ago.

> Am I not right?  Is my logic flawed?

> It is only on the 23rd, when Wuhan was locked down, that we finally have some sort of flyers all over our place, flyers to demand everyone wear a mask, and then from the 23rd to the 24th and now 25th, we finally started seeing people wearing masks.  So it is not about the citizens refusing to wear masks, it is about the local government not doing anything at all, or maybe they even have some ulterior motive.  As for what motive, let's not discuss about them.  We can only say that in this pandemic, even after the 2003 experience, we are just repeating our mistakes, and the current situation is definitely just as bad as the 2003 SARS, if not worse.

> If you want to go outside, to get checked, all of the public transportation is stopped.  If you want to drive yourself to the hospital, there are no gas stations for you to refill at.  Though I don't know for a fact that the gas stations stopped operation, I've heard it from the Internet, and did not check it myself, so this is still speculation.  

> Then, the whole picture for the current situation is that medical service is completely paralyzed, or should I say, in total chaos.  I have a lot of friends who work at hospitals say that if you enter a hospital, they'll just give you some anti-inflammatory drugs, or some hormone injection, or to put it bluntly, you are just left for dead.

> If you are strong, you might make it through.  If you don't, you're dead.

> And the worst thing is some of the ""suspected cases"" are just as good as confirmed, but they ran out of test solutions or something like that, or they simply don't have enough resources or manpower to test it.  They'll tell you to go home and isolate yourselves.  I want to fucking ask, can you find another country on this planet to be such fucking bullshit?  Even if you are suspected to have contracted the disease, not to mention those who are confirmed to have been diagnosed, you should at least get some form of medical treatment, right?

> How can they just toss you away like that?

> If you are a super-spreader, then, doesn't that mean that the government, or the medical facility has just told you to carry the virus all over the place?  And cross-contaminate everyone?

> As a regular citizen, no matter how well you know about medical knowledge and how well you isolate yourself, you won't be as well-informed as the hospital staff, and won't be isolated as safely.  Can you find another country on this planet, another government, to fuck shit up like this?

> I'm here on YouTube, with this video.  I don't have any ulterior motive.  I simply  think that in one's lifetime, there will always come to the time when you must speak out the truth.  Sometimes in life, you have to inevitably lie to survive or for whatever reason.  But in some specific occasion, for example right now, I think it is necessary to speak out the truth with your own heart and conscience.  Wuhan is like the fucking hell right now.  It used to be a very civil place.  The place where Mr. Sun Yat-sen started the revolution to overthrow Imperial China.  He fired his first round here.  It was suggested to build Wuhan like the current New York, a modern city.

> But now?  What does it look like now?

> You see all kinds of pathetic, ridiculous, outrageous, tragic, every moment you can see videos on twitter or other social media, some familiar roads of Wuhan, or someone with a Wuhan accent, some random person just drops dead or all kinds of scenarios All those tragedies are just happening on the first day of Lunar New Year.  It was supposed to be a festive happy day we all celebrate But now, do you think us as Wuhan people, or as Chinese can feel happy?

> And I hope that all overseas Chinese can understand one point.  We the Chinese, at least my friends in our 20s and 30s, are not dumbasses, are not brainwashed.  In our brains we all know it clearly

> [Reference to a political scandal]

> We can ignore that and make fun of it.  But we are all fucking know what this country really is.  We just have no ways, no power, our bodies are made of flesh and blood.  We can't beat full metal jackets and tanks.

> I hope every single overseas Chinese who can watch this video, can help us.  You don't have to spend a dime or do anything.  You just tap with your finger, get the message out.  I'm not making a living out of this.  I just want to create some public pressure to make the Chinese know not how to escape their responsibilities.  They escaped all the way to some random shithole island in Qing Hai, to act like they are giving instructions to deal with the pandemic.

> Instructions my ass, are you thinking everyone else is retarded?  Fuck you.

> Now, we as people could think in other's positions,
> right?

> Imagine you are a Wuhan citizen right now.  If you are living on this land.  Your family, your friends, all the people you know.  Suddenly contracted the disease.  It's not like they refused to cooperate.  But they just have no way to get any medical treatments.  Can't even get diagnosed.  They can only sit there and be tormented by the disease and eventually death.

> A man only lives fucking once.  You've only got one life.  
> Once you're dead, it's all over.

> And this virus, it's not causing symptoms as the officials said, fever, cough, or whatever.  Even if you have no fever and no cough, you can still have the disease.  And it's not only through oral transmissions.  You can also get it through your eye mucus.  This is already confirmed.  Many medical
> staffs have already confirmed this.  

> And one month before the lockdown, During the New Year
> rush, a million or two already have left Wuhan.  What about those people?  How do you prevent them from spreading the disease?  Are you going to lock down all of China?

> Lockdown this, lockdown that.  What the fuck have you been doing before this?

> So I hope everyone who can watch my video can treasure this video as it was really difficult to upload.  I have been risking getting caught by the police all this time.  Trying to get the truth out.  We are really helpless.

> Not all of us are brainwashed.  We, too want to live the life with democracy and freedom.

> Open.

> And we wanted to browse the internet without having to use a VPN.

> But we just can't, what can we even do about it?  Right?  High housing cost, living cost, inflation.  Whatever happens to the rank-and-file politicians, they'll scrape benefits off us peasants, and we can only watch.

> All of the friends around me, as long as they are rich or have the ability, they would fucking migrate the very moment they could.  None of us are dumb, we just have no power.  I urge you guys to help, at least right now, we the Wuhan people really need the international pressure and awareness.  We are really too helpless.

No mention is made of the requirement for an N95 but wouldn’t hurt to use over a surgical mask but more stringent equipment such as face shields and full gowns for health care workers should also be considered. 

I would just like to say that based on your post, you are quite uninformed. Coronavirus is spread via nebulizing droplet which means that it is not airborne. Airborne means that it is free floating and can reside in the air for hours on end. For it to be an airborne virus, you would literally have to follow biocontainment procedure with respirators and full level 3 or 4 quarantine. So you clearly don’t understand the difference between particle and droplet. It is spread through the air in short distances, you would literally have to be standing in front of someone who sneezed (probably more than once) to actually be exposed. It is also spread via touch and hard surfaces. In fact, I would argue that the spread of the novel coronavirus is more effective via hard surface and touch than it is droplet. Regardless control measures should all be the same. 

It is very upsetting when uninformed people post potentially harmful and misleading information like this and it is my duty as a public health professional to correct. I suggest you take my comments with a grain of salt and learn from the experience. You might be asking, what the hell does this person know? I am a professional epidemiologist who has worked with viruses for the past decade and have worked in level 3 biocontainment facilities."

I don't really like this argument at all. The deaths from these diseases are relatively stable from year to year. They are also non-contagious and we already deal with and understand the consequences of them. 

Its no doubt in my mind that Coronavirus will fizzle out like so many before it. But it even so its worth considering that even without killing a single person, it has the potential to be a huge effect on day to day living. 

Airport security increase, travel plans gone, schools and work can be closed. Furthermore, we are a country of tourism with a large portion of people are dependent on tourists coming and spending money. China and Asia are major players in this industry and even a few months of non-travel can have a pretty big effect.

[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are multiple ways you can prepare yourself (and CDC recommends most of these actions).

&#x200B;

Prepare a minimum of two weeks worth of non-perishable foods in your house (up to a month probably wouldn't hurt).

Have a first aid kit in your house, plus bottled water. It wouldn't hurt to have a means to boil water without electricity in your house as well.

Have a portable radio and lots of spare batteries (or have a solar/hand cranked radio). Candles, a lighter, and a flashlight are also good to have (just for general preparedness).

Make sure your family has gotten the flu shot if you can, that way if things do get bad, you will be able to avoid false positives. If this blows over getting the flu shot is still a great idea because prevention is usually much cheaper than a cure!

Stay healthy right now (so have a balanced diet, use Vitamin C supplements if needed). A healthy body has a stronger immune system and will let you fight off any disease more effectively.

&#x200B;

The CDC website will probably have more information!"

В 2003 у них был похожий вирус и настоящие данные пришли куда позже. Тем более у них сейчас закрывают столько городов что в карантине остаются более 20млн человек. Ещё и дороги все разрушают, строют больницы в срочном порядке, много неофициально погибших. Не думаю что таки меры были бы а случае маленькой контролируемой инфекции в том районе города (Wuhan). Опасность этого вируса в том что лекарство или вакцину от него пока не изобрели, антибиотики не действуют (они против бактерий). На это уйдет долгое время. Его понять даже пока толком не могут. А это ещё только первое поколение, довольно смертельное (вирус пока не понял что ему надо медленнее убивать чтобы дольше оставаться живым) потом он будет мутировать. Да и передача воздушно капельным путем усиливает риск заражения. Я не вирусолог конечно, а диванный аналитик, но думаю данные факты довольно общие и настораживают.

If the mods got that ridiculous we could talk to reddit staff so this kind of gatekeeping doesn't happen.

I agree with you, though I wouldn't go that for to say the moderators would be ridiculous to close this and we would immediately need Reddit staff to interfere.

Let's see if a mod makes a verdict on this thread and leave the speculation aside. Do keep in mind that when such threads get closed, it's often due to the fact that these threads conversely attracts racist comments itself. I hope you understand why it would closed under such circumstances.

**Full disclosure, I'm Chinese myself** \- in case some of this unintentionally comes off as (or is spinned into being) racism.

I disagree with the original commenter (u/ColtonBoreen)'s statement that this is purely

>... reflective of these people's ignorance, and there really isn't much you can do to teach them. It sucks.

It's certainly not true that there's nothing we can do, at least in context of Reddit itself. Every post/comment like this one helps to stem ignorance. And if some refuse to read it, so be it.

It's also not just racism that's resulting from ignorance on this issue. I've seen too many posts/comments displaying medical and statistical ignorance, as well as pure immaturity: calling 2019-nCoV ""the Coronavirus"", claiming ""we're all going to die!"" and that the mortality rate is ""63%"" as well as treating the whole outbreak as a joke. These sort of things happen. You can't stop them from happening. But you can try to correct and educate the one's you come across.

And no, don't correct them with vitriol and throwing back whatever words they threw at you. Do it in a respectful manner."

Since you're young, you can actually afford to take more risks because you have a long time horizon of future earnings ahead of you to cover any losses.

2020-01-27,reptilesocks,boxoffice,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/euacl2/economic_impact_of_coronavirus_will_likely_top_40/ffpqbey/,"You’re forgetting incubation periods and modes of transmission. 

Take for instance the HIV virus. When it first showed up it had an incubation period YEARS long and a lethality rate around 15-20%. Luckily for the human race it required fluid exchange to jump hosts and spent a long while confined to specific subsets of the population. An airborne HIV virus would have quickly jumped out of those communities and wiped out unimaginable amounts of people. 

The nightmare virus would have high lethality, easy airborne transmission (and it would propagate itself through lots of sneezing and coughing), a very long incubation period, and the ability to mimic symptoms of other common diseases. The worst version of that would have a brief surge in the first few weeks where it resembles the common cold and causes a lot of sneezing and coughing to propagate itself, and then lie dormant for another few weeks or months before the lethality sets in. 

Something like that - say, with a six-month incubation period - could start in a major travel hub during a mass migration and make it all over the world and through massive populations before anyone even knows it exists, and THEN once the lethality period sets in we could be in a situation where we helplessly sit back and watch hundreds of millions of people die. 

Right now the scary thing about the Coronavirus is the possible two-week incubation period that allows a considerable amount of time during which it can hop hosts and spread. 

Anyway, that’s a long way of saying: a 100% lethal (to humans, that is) virus, having jumped from some animal to humans, could actually do an enormous amount of damage before driving itself extinct in humans."

Might as well do what I always do stay indoors, write a book, watch anime and draw. Because if the world burns like literally not much we can do I mean we can do something about it. 

But aren't we a little too late?

Sure we  can prevent this from happening ever again probably but we can't really stop this stuff from happening now...just prevent it.

Though I can't really say much myself,

At any rate my opionion about the war if it happened it would have happened by now so I'm not all too worried about that because quite frankly they all have the means to make it happen. But no one has, so it better to stay that way.

But since the fire is going on well, we can't do much but wait for rain well MORE rain to put it out.

During the hot weather we are getting it just gonna get worse probrally I barely keep up to the date with the news, so the virus was news for me I mean I did hear about it happening in china from a discord chat or it was youtube but other then that I suppose we just do what we normally do.

The only thing we can do now is make sure we can prevent what's happening now, to prevent it from happening in the near future because let's face it the damage is already done.

We can fix everything but the changes won't happen straight away, I'm not saying don't I'm just saying we need to and we need to do it soon so the affects of the change can happen over of the course of the next decade or even years ahead.

Because healing the Earth gonna take more then one year.

>	You didn’t know him.

The mental gymnastics required to have these two sentences in the same comment is insane. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where someone like you gains access to the kind of money Kobe had and then lives their lifestyle the exact same way as before, so they can stick it to rich people and feel better about themselves. And it’s kinda cracking me up. If you don’t understand that the only reason a person would feel that way about Kobe spending his money is because of jealousy, you need to read a psychology book. Personally I think if someone wants to cut traffic by taking a helicopter in order to get more things done in his day, there’s nothing wrong with that. Especially considering he can do that shit without even denting his financial situation in the slightest. 

Also how does it make any sense whatsoever that the ONLY problem that anyone should care about it the biggest problem that’s currently happening. Yeah man, put EVERYTHING on the planet on hold until the biggest problem is fixed. Do nothing more. You thought you could spend a few minutes mourning a person who died in tragic circumstances? Pfft, what a waste. You should have spend those minutes working towards a solution to the Coronavirus like every other person in the planet! /s

On AIDS and denial:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_the_United_States#Public_health_policies

> One of the best-known works on the history of HIV is 1987's book And the Band Played On, by Randy Shilts. Shilts contends that Ronald Reagan's administration dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to infect hundreds of thousands more. 

This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power by Larry Kramer. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.[18]

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/coronavirus-crisis-china-response.html

Its rigidly hierarchical bureaucracy discourages local officials from raising bad news with central bosses whose help they might need. And it silos those officials off from one another, making it harder to see, much less manage, the full scope of spiraling crises.

This approach is seen as crucial in having enabled China to lift hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty and turn itself from global backwater into world power.

But it can be disastrous when it comes to managing health and environmental issues."

On average they contribute to about 25% of colds. While yes, it is more dangerous because it affects only the upper respiratory system alone compared to the more common rhinovirus that affects the upper and lower respiratory. Unless you’re in a high risk group (babies, elderly, and immunocompromised) then while you may get sick, it’s gonna be on par with a cold, maybe worse but still a cold. There are very RARE complications such as neurological, gastrointestinal, and yeah death but again... high risk groups are gonna be the most susceptible. It’s on us as the healthy people to protect our high risk groups by being healthy and practicing a judicious outlook so we don’t become vectors and endangering others. 

TL;DR as long as you’re immunocompetent, you’re not gonna have an issue with coronavirus. If you think you may have it, go to a doctor because antivirals work best in the early stages."

The simple problem in both cases is this: we don't know the actual denominator of  true cases. We can reasonably assume for both flu and coronavirus that it is bigger, in fact, much bigger than the official tally since we know that in both cases many have symptoms that would be considered subclinical. So actual case mortality is illusive and from what we know we can't see with any scientific certainty that it is 2-3x as deadly as flu. 

I worked in public health in China during the SARS crisis and it was clear then (and we have little reason to believe that this has changed that much since then) that sentinel capture of even clinical cases is not particularly precise. 

I think the post I was responding to is spot on: the mutability of these viruses is the real potential story here. But it is still only potential."

""The 2003 Sars outbreak saw a decline in consumption of exotic animals by normally adventurous Chinese diners in the following years. According to a survey released in 2006 by San Francisco-based WildAid and the official China Wildlife Conservation Association, about 70% of 24,000 people surveyed in 16 mainland cities had not eaten wild animals in the previous year, up from 51% in a similar survey in 1999. While number fell, it showed **30% of those surveyed were still eating wildlife**.""

""**A 2003 poll taken in Guangdong province found that half of the population had eaten wildlife, snake being named as the favourite of 45% of those surveyed.**""

""The figures are staggering. Twenty tonnes of snakes and as many as 20,000 birds were eaten every day in Guangdong restaurants in 2001, reported the *South China Morning Post*. One Guangzhou restaurant, “Chock Full O’Snakes”, served 600 to 700 kilograms of snakes every day throughout January 2001 – the first month of the Year of the Snake. Some wildlife restaurants in Guangzhou can seat as many as 1,000 people.

In 2001, China announced fines of 1,000 to 10,000 yuan for anyone caught eating protected wildlife. But in 2004 Xinhua news agency reported the State Forestry Administration as saying that the cobra population has fallen 90% in the previous decade, while numbers of the common rat snake had dropped 75%. Intense snake hunting in some grain-producing areas of south China has been associated with a rise in local rat populations, which in turn has led to significant loss of grain eaten by the rats.""

China is fucking decimating animals for plague-ridden food and bullshit medicine within its national borders and what's worse, abroad. It doesn't matter if it's just ""a few"" (which it's not). A few percentage points in China are the size of a whole decently sized country. And if we take those 30% figures (residents eating wildlife), then we have something like 400-500 million people consuming wildlife. Apart from the animal welfare and conservation issues, we cannot afford a population the size of the EU eating wild animals, which are the cause of **70% of all human infections**.

2020-01-27,Wholesome_Serial,toronto,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/ety39j/ontario_health_officials_say_first_presumptive/ffqcedj/,"Ideally, you'd want to escape it, get away before you could be infected, understanding in the meantime that _if you were_, you would still have a time limit before whatever initial diagnosis in some form was available through presentation and confirmation of infection would arise. But there's that uncertainty there, in either direction.

I look at this like being close enough to a bomb blast, not necessarily a nuclear device (primitive compared to hundreds of generations of thermonuclear detonators, from the rod-slide-into-to full fusile implosion bombs, but more than enough to kill the bulk of a city's population, and cripple or half-burn or blind many of the survivors) but even a mortar landing or a surface-to-air-to-surface missile: if you're quite literally coming from the epicenter of such an infective pre-pandemic to another country where no infection has yet arisen, you may as well be choosing to die where you are or die with your loved ones at home...and then killing by similar, virulent infection hundreds of other people, or worse.

Would you want to do the selfish, but entirely human thing and be at home with the people you love when you have an appreciable chance of dying (even though you might with precaution and care avoid infection, potentially), but risk that you were infected and your homecoming also risk the chance of a second, otherwise unrelated pandemic (small or large-scale) happening in your own neighbourhood and home country if you do so?

The big thing is going to be the uncertainty, and I agree with you: if you could realistically get away from that epicenter (but stay in that country, given the size of China and that there is a rather specific core infective area at the moment), you would lower your risk of infection (and by the incubation period's proscribed ending, you could be 'clear'), whereas if you stayed and assumed you were infected or would be infected, you would be one more casualty that didn't have to happen.

The two main operating points that put my mind strongly where it still sits, are twofold: this person came here straight from Yuwan Province, where I understand the worst of the worst is happening. 

Literal shutdown of all city services, hospitals are jammed so badly you can't call in _any_ emergency help, and if you get there on foot (often for something other than the coronavirus, like a broken bone or diabetic complications) you yourself (and whoever brought you there) would very likely be infected and incubating within you the virus while you wait the five-hours-plus to see any medical professional at all. 

The other being that Chinese medical authorities were almost certainly away of the first infections before the whole shebang went into full-on disaster mode. They knew where it was beginning to localize weeks before it's gotten to where it is, the first cases were cropping up once that incubation period was done, but were apparently quite happy to let anybody go home (or out of the country per permit or free movement, per se) despite the odds being extremely strong that even a small fraction of those people were prospective/incubating hosts for the virii they carried.

I won't ask what I would do if I could choose to stop any and all flights out of China's Yuwan Province and any other core infective areas outside of the country/out-continent. I will say that if the odds were quite simply that good that I was a carrier, I would stay put, certainly if the country I was in was where the pre-pandemic stages were slamming into place (and I'm sure that even if the local media had their mouths shut, local word-of-mouth would suffice to inform me while it could be told). That would be the moral choice I would make, for myself."

The key word here being ""suggestions"" - It's still not confirmed by the WHO, CDC, Heath Canada, etc. that symptomless patients can spread the disease. My understanding is that this is determined by contact tracing, so it can be difficult in early stages to tell whether there's been symptomless transmission, or whether you've just missed a contact when you were doing tracing.

Nobody's saying it definitely can't be transmitted when symptomless. What we're saying is it's too early to tell. The data's just not there."

You shoot a man in the head, he will die quickly afterward. That's the most painless way to murder.

You give birth to a child, he will die 80 years later, but, before he dies, he must experience sufferings first, and in the end, he may die painfully (diseases and whatnot). That's the most painless way to live.

Most people say, there's more good than suffering in life. I say, ""so what?"" If beforelife is Hell and afterlife is Heaven, sure, I'll have as many children as I can. But non-existence sounds like sleeping. I bet most people like sleep, probably even more than working.

Is that correct or no?

Wet markets are all over the place, often selling wild animals. 

Eating wildlife is still a hallmark of Chinese culture and nowhere unheard of or uncommon. A lot of Chinese posters and sympathetic foreigners are spreading the notion that wildlife consumption is something only the 0.01% partake in but that is FAR from the truth.

Sources:

""The 2003 Sars outbreak saw a decline in consumption of exotic animals by normally adventurous Chinese diners in the following years. According to a survey released in 2006 by San Francisco-based WildAid and the official China Wildlife Conservation Association, about 70% of 24,000 people surveyed in 16 mainland cities had not eaten wild animals in the previous year, up from 51% in a similar survey in 1999. While number fell, it showed **30% of those surveyed were still eating wildlife**.""

[https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1842104/why-wild-animals-are-a-key-ingredient-in-chinas-coronavirus-outbreak](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1842104/why-wild-animals-are-a-key-ingredient-in-chinas-coronavirus-outbreak)

""**A 2003 poll taken in Guangdong province found that half of the population had eaten wildlife, snake being named as the favourite of 45% of those surveyed.**""

""The figures are staggering. Twenty tonnes of snakes and as many as 20,000 birds were eaten every day in Guangdong restaurants in 2001, reported the *South China Morning Post*. One Guangzhou restaurant, “Chock Full O’Snakes”, served 600 to 700 kilograms of snakes every day throughout January 2001 – the first month of the Year of the Snake. Some wildlife restaurants in Guangzhou can seat as many as 1,000 people.

In 2001, China announced fines of 1,000 to 10,000 yuan for anyone caught eating protected wildlife. But in 2004 Xinhua news agency reported the State Forestry Administration as saying that the cobra population has fallen 90% in the previous decade, while numbers of the common rat snake had dropped 75%. Intense snake hunting in some grain-producing areas of south China has been associated with a rise in local rat populations, which in turn has led to significant loss of grain eaten by the rats.""

These figures may seem old but here's a 2014 study:

""An attitudinal survey on wildlife consumption and conservation awareness was conducted in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Kunming and Nanning of China recently. Comparison with the results from a similar survey we did in 2004, after 8 years, **the proportion of respondents who had consumed wildlife was dropped slightly from 31.3 % down to 29.6 %.""**

China is  decimating animals for plague-ridden food and bullshit medicine within its national borders and what's worse, abroad. A few percentage points in China are the size of a whole decently sized country. And if we take those 30% figures (residents eating wildlife), then we have something like 400-500 million people consuming wild animals. Apart from the animal welfare and conservation issues, we cannot as a global collective afford a population the size of the EU eating wild animals, which are the cause of **70% of all human infections**.

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/246620/Plague\_Inc\_Evolved/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/246620/Plague_Inc_Evolved/) 

Keep in mind that what is different about this outbreak is:

\- It is not contained in any way unlike when the Ebola outbreak occurred. Some analysts/economists say the worst is still to come. (despite what some dumbass Pharma CEOs will lead you to believe saying that it's contained). 

\- They have no idea how to fight it (outside of it being a coronavirus and cousin to SARS/MERS) and have only now been able to isolate it in a lab via environmental samples taken from the market. The only thing they know for sure now is that it definitely came from the seafood market in Wuhan. They currently do not know how severe the illness can be, how well it is transmitted between people and other features of the virus. A Vaccine may be months away.  (minimum 3-4 months from trials, and at least a year from the vaccine). 

\- You can't trust what China says. So data coming out of China is inaccurate. 

\- It has jumped 3 steps already from patient 0 to patient 1 who then passed it to patient 2. (so its mutating which means bad!). 

\- There are reports that it's now spreading asymptomatically and it has an incubation period of 1-14 days. During this time a sick person may not show symptoms or have just a small sniffle (which may be mistaken for a common cold/flu) and yet during this time they are contiguous. 

\- Many underreported cases in China. The attack vector has not been identified. China is warning of an increased rate of infections. 

\- China is dedicating 11 billion Yuan $1.58 billion to fight the crisis. China is now on full alert and its leadership is under unprecedented pressure to contain this crisis. 

\- Most of China is infected outside of remote regions such as Tibet. (15 cities with a combined population of 57 million people have been placed on full or partial lockdown). 

\- The infection rate is rising rapidly. (high upward spike), It went from 1200 to 2794 infected in just a few days. They don't know if it's due to under-reporting or a spike in the attack coefficient. 

\- The virus is highly mutagenic. 

\- This is happening during the Lunar New Year Holiday which has millions of people traveling across Asia. Lunar New Year is the ""largest people movement on the planet"". So we won't know the extent of the infection until after people go back home after the holiday. 

\- It has already made its way to the US and Europe and Australia. 

\- It is estimated that each person infected has gone on to spread the virus to 2 or 3 others. (60% of transmission would have to be blocked to be effecting in controlling the outbreak). 

The good news is that right now the mortality rate currently is only 3.4% and you need it to hit like 60-80% like SARS did and a very high infection rate for a Pandemic. 

It's not yet become a global health emergency according to the WHO but they say it may become one.  

My take is that if it mutates into something much more severe or becomes airborne China is probably fucked at least in the short term. If that happens you are looking at a global recession. Fear will keep people from spending and that's already starting to happen in China. Travel has dropped in China 28.8% from a year ago according to Li Xiaoming the Vice Minister of transport. 

InterContinental Hotels Group fell 4%

Investors may be getting a bit nervous because there is no cure and no vaccination currently available or anywhere in sight. 

Moderna is working with the National Institute of Health on a cure its stock went up 7% following the report. 

Maybe invest in a bug out bag?...and/or a Glock?"

You said that I'm like a Taiwanese wumao. Except, I'm not really Taiwanese. On the other hand, I am Chinese. I do have Taiwanese ancestry but I was raised to identify as Chinese and I'm only 25% Taiwanese. Also, I'm first and foremost an Australian. In any case, the way that you framed that statement implied that I'm some kind of brainwashed Taiwanese, when I am, in fact, an outsider who has done my own research on Taiwan and come to my own conclusions independently of any sort of external manipulating force.

>I'm merely criticising the fact that you can't seem to accept people discussing China at all,

Nope. In fact, in real life, I am constantly surrounded by people discussing China, mostly family members, but also peers and contemporaries and acquaintances. In real life, I have only ever met a single Taiwanese person from outside of my own family; within my own family, I've technically met around 15 Taiwanese people, mostly with only partial ancestry. On the other hand, I have met hundreds of Chinese people in both Australia and China throughout my life so far. I've lived in China for around 8 months in total throughout my life whereas I have never even set foot in Taiwan once.

>and that you have no nuance or even basic understanding of the situation

No, I have a pretty good understanding of the situation. I think the mass graves speak for themselves. Have you ever in your life dreamed to see a tower of real human skulls? For, I have. I saw such a thing when I was around fourteen years old.

>especially if you think China's designs on Taiwan and the ROC are ""irrational"" and nonsensical.

People in China at this very moment are claiming that the Wuhan Coronavirus that is currently ravaging the country was planted there by Bill Gates. We're talking about a country here that censors Wikipedia. A country where people literally piss on the floor... and I've actually seen this with my own very eyes, so this is not just some propaganda or something. In China, people cannot think for themselves because they are raised to ""love the party"" from birth. In Australia, there are still a lot of stupid people, but at least critical thinking isn't a crime if you so choose to partake in such an activity.

>Note that doesn't mean I think the CCP has a 'legitimate' claim - just that there is an obvious reason for it.

The reason why the CPC maintains an incessant territorial claim to Taiwan is because the CPC is an illegitimate regime and Taiwan is living proof of that.

>What you're telling me is that you're an overseas Chinese

Yes, this is correct.

>that doesn't have a full understanding of the situation.

No, this is not correct. I probably know more about China than 90% of people who actually live (permanently) in China.

>Call it racism if you want, but you're an overseas Chinese foreigner.

Yes, this is literally racism. You're a racist.

>You are viewing things from a very biased outside perspective.

Nope. As a young child, I used to hate the United States. It was literally my least favourite country. So, I'm no American fanboy. I'm a critical thinker with my own entirely independent philosophies, ideologies, and worldviews. I also used to hate Australia until around 1.5 years ago. Furthermore, when I was around five years old, my mother literally told me that ""the Japanese are the enemy"". The only country that I was taught to love, as a young child, was the People's Republic of China.

>I was too, until a few years ago when moved back to Taiwan.

Right, so you moved back to Taiwan and now you support Chinese reunification? Maybe you, the real foreigner, should go back to where **you** come from.

>I was very fervently anti-China

On the contrary, I was a Chinese nationalist during my youth from around the ages of maybe four until sixteen. I'm currently eighteen. So, I haven't been pro-Taiwan for much of my life, so far.

>and was surprised at the amount of people in Taiwan that view themselves as Chinese

Personally, I view Taiwanese people as Overseas Chinese, which means they are ethnic-Chinese who are not citizens of the People's Republic of China. Taiwanese people are also beginning to develop a unique Taiwanese identity.

>\- then I realised the predominant sentiment is more correctly anti-CCP, rather than just anti-China.

Yes, most Taiwanese people dislike the Communist Party of China. However, many Taiwanese people also dislike the Chinese Nationalist Party, aka the Kuomintang. The political, cultural, and ideological situation in Taiwan is much more complex than just ""anti-CPC"". Also, personally, I'm not anti-China, and I don't think people who are anti-CPC are necessarily also anti-China.

>You say you frequent [r/ChunghwaMinkuo](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChunghwaMinkuo/)

Correct. I generally don't strongly agree with the views with most of the frequent users of that subreddit.

>\- how many people there do you think dream about annexing the mainland and dissolving the CCP?

No idea. Don't care. I was like the 30th person to join that subreddit. It has currently tripled in size since I joined it.

>Why would it be 'logical' for the ROC to claim the mainland but 'illogical' for the CCP to claim Taiwan?

Well, firstly the Republic of China has historically ruled mainland China from 1912 until 1949, and it was also recognised as the legitimate government of China from 1949 until 1971 whilst it was physically exiled to Taiwan. However, with that being said, I don't really believe that the Republic of China should retake the mainland. A few weeks ago, I made some comments on r/China where I specifically stated that I do **not** want to overthrow the Communist Party of China because I believe that this will lead to mass instability and will lead to more negative than positive consequences, at least in the short term. The only thing that I actually want, at the moment, is for the Communist Party of China to relinquish its territorial claim to Taiwan, at least for the foreseeable future.

>Honestly, your whole argument just doesn't really make any sense.

Yeah, to you, maybe, because you don't actually understand what my positions on various matters actually are, and you've just been making wild guesses."

There is a canine Coronavirus (not transmissible to humans) and I believe there is a vaccine. It isn’t on the course of recommended vaccines in my area because it isn’t prevalent. 

I used to do volunteer work in rescue and was frequently at my city’s municipal shelter with sick/immunocompromised dogs or puppies without vaccines in my house. At one point I had puppies with distemper in isolation in my house and I can tell you the sanitation procedures we used to keep disease to a minimum if you’re really worried. Keep in mind that we were mostly concerned about canine parvovirus, which can live on just about anything and you can track it into your house on your shoes. The novel Coronavirus isn’t nearly that good at spreading from what we’ve seen so these measures would be extreme. First of all make sure your dog is current on vaccines. This isn’t an extreme measure, it’s just good pet ownership. Second, keep your dog indoors and (as much as you can) in an area other pets don’t have access to. Keep insects out of your home. When you come home, use a bleach solution or wipe on your shoes including the bottom. Take your clothes off when you come in the door and throw them in the wash, or in a trash bag that you can seal off for the time being if you need to go to the laundry mat. Dry on high heat. Use hand sanitizer or wash your hands frequently just like the WHO recommends. Wash your dog’s toys, bedding, kennel, and bowls regularly. Do not allow your dog to share bowls or water with pets outside of your home. If you want to be really thorough, wipe paws (including between the pads) when you come back inside your house. Add some bleach when mopping your floors. Again, these are the measures we took when visiting the municipal shelter and then coming home to sick dogs or puppies, so they’re a little over the top. We take similar measures when there’s a bad parvo outbreak in our area just in case. But these are pretty extreme. Given what we know about this virus I wouldn’t be too concerned about transmission from dogs."

**GL:** Fatality ratio during the beginning of an epidemic is usually low. We learned that from SARS. For the first few weeks of SARS the WHO estimated 3-5% case fatality, it turned out to be 17% in HK. That's because of the timespan from infection to symptoms, to hospitalization, to treatment, to recovering or expiring - a full month. A cross-sectional cut will underestimate the true case fatality due to the characteristics of coronavirus (?). Secondly, overseas cases are self-screening for better prognosis (I am heavily paraphrasing that) because if you are very sick you won't travel and you can't pass the thermal screen. To base our actions on those cases which are caught early by thermal scans in otherwise healthy passengers is optimistic.  


\>>> This. Watched live online earlier and it was the perfect conclusion to their conference. It doesn't mean we should go all reckless and be paranoid and hysterical. But not all inconvenient data/predictions should also be labeled as ""fear mongering"". As WHO/CDC have already mentioned before, what we need is transparency in these times. You can't combat an outbreak by keeping people in the dark. ((Unless you're CPC, then go ahead. Business as usual))"

Biological warfare (BW)—also known as germ warfare—is the use of biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi with the intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war. Biological weapons (often termed ""bio-weapons"", ""biological threat agents"", or ""bio-agents"") are living organisms or replicating entities (viruses, which are not universally considered ""alive"") that reproduce or replicate within their host victims. Entomological (insect) warfare is also considered a type of biological weapon. This type of warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare and chemical warfare, which together with biological warfare make up NBC, the military initialism for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).

~7 day asymptomatic infectious airborne incubation time

As far as I know, it spreads through contact with bodily fluids of an infected person, so if you maintain very good personal hygiene (wash hands regularly with soap or use hand sanitizers) you should be ok. If you live in a place with a high number of cases (East Asia mainly - like China, HK, Singapore, etc) then you should be even more careful about personal hygiene - wearing surgical masks when in public would be the bare minimum you could do.

We have an Ebola vaccine that is 97.5% effective.

Cancer death rates are dropping dramatically in late stage cancers due to immunotherapy, an entirely new drug class whose potential is just beginning to be unlocked.

The economy of the globe is growing at a steady pace and over the past decade has lifted millions out of poverty.

Polio and the guinea worm parasitic infections are on the verge of eradication. If they are successfully eliminated, they will be the second and third diseases after smallpox to be wiped off the face of the earth due to prevention and vaccination.

The 90-90-90 campaign to get 90% of HIV patients diagnosed, 90% of those on therapy, and 90% of those patients with undetectable viral loads (which means they cannot transmit the virus) just barely missed its goals for 2020 and is leading to reductions of HIV transmission and deaths globally.

Scientists are inching closer to a universal flu vaccine which would prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths a year.

CRISPR/Cas9 is allowing scientists to begin curing genetic diseases that previously were completely incurable.

Okay, so first and formerly. The coronavirus has a lethality rate about 3% to 5%. Older people, young people (like babies) and people with already complications are at higher risk of getting life threatening complications.

The virus itself doesn't survive long in the air, or on surfaces for that matter. You can get it by being close to people, people sneezing at you ECT.

Oh, and it seems that a German scientist named Rolf Hilgenfeld wants to try out his vaccine on infected mice. He has had history of the coronavirus and has tried to develop a vaccine for SARS and MERS since 2003.

My advice for you: Practice basic hygiene, don't travel to China and just calm down. Panicking about it isn't going to help. I've already done that and it didn't help me at all. I know it's scary but it'll be alright. Thankfully has China acted quickly by quarentining the city and located where the virus came from originally. Other countries are on high alert as well.

Just calm down, and don't listen to the media all that much. They get money on views and clicks and of course they will make everything seem worse."

During this period of the year, a lot of tourists cross those villages and family and friends of the villagers go to visit them. They are also prohibiting the villagers from visiting their families, and blocking the passage of public vehicles, subway stations and etc.

The majority of Chinese people on the internet seem positive about those attitudes, while others not so much.

If masks were effective at filtering infectious droplets, why is it that [higher quality masks do not provide more protection](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190903134732.htm)?

I would recommend OP go on a news diet.  Stop listening to every talking head yell how the world is going to end.

Nuclear attacks - didn't happen.  Iran is just bluffing to buy time to reorganize their Quds forces and stabilize their domestic issues.  North Korea bluffs about nuclear attacks about once every 2-3 years when they start running low on humanitarian aid.   It's like a sickly bum on the street corner threatening to beat up a 250 lbs. man unless he gives him $20 for food and smokes.

Multiple deaths from military bombings - I assume this is about the General Soleimani killing.  It was inevitable, as that man was organizing para-military attacks all over the Middle East and focused on disrupting coalition forces in Iraq.  Sadly, can we even name a single month in the last 20 years where there was NO military bombings anywhere in the ME?

Australia burning - Yeah, the areas affected by the fires are huge, but the issue behind the fires is far more complex than global warming.   Australia has always had fire months due to the dry grasslands in the Outback.   The Aboriginal people developed fire breaks and controlled burns a thousand years before westerners arrived due to this.   Also, the news talk about the fires suddenly went away when it was discovered that a lot of the fires were acts of arson or carelessness.

Coronavirus - It's ugly but regional epidemics are nothing new.  The news media loves to hyperventilate about epidemics spreading but it never happens as severe as made out on TV.   Remember the Ebola outbreaks a few years ago?  If you only got your info from news broadcasts, it was the first sign of the apocalypse.  The reality was that it was terrible for the people of west Africa but did not spread much outside, given the efforts doctors and nations did to quarantine the infected and treat them.  The Coronavirus is going to end the same way: terrible if you live in the epidemic center but not going to be a significant event outside of it."

I get it, they're family and you care about them. That's fair. But it's also fair to tell the government if anyone the grandparents came into contact with had been feeling ill, and to get them properly screened by said government when they enter the country. Finally, keeping them in quarantine in 1 bedroom of the house until the time has passed that they could become ill. Does it suck? Yes. But not as much as it would suck to kill someone in your family by being reckless.

&#x200B;

It's the same reason we had our first case in my country: The man came from that area of China after a trip, had been experiencing flu-like symptoms, presumably lied during border crossing because our government is getting everyone to fill out questionnaires about how they're feeling and where they travelled from, and this guy's form didn't say he was feeling ill, went home to his wife, and someone else called emergency on the man because they found all of this out. He was quarantined, and found to have coronavirus. Then his wife caught it. Lord knows who else he put at risk by willy-nilly walking around with the coronavirus.

First, the basic reproduction number (R0) is defined as *the number of secondary cases arising from a single index case in an otherwise uninfected population*. It is *not* more generally the number of people one person will likely infect. Second, R0 is calculated for a specific population in a specific context, and may not apply to other populations. For example, initial estimates for R0 for SARS were much higher than was observed in spreading of the disease in other countries.

In addition, others have pointed out already that ""coronavirus"" is actually a family of viruses, each with apparently different transmission rates.

There was a containment breach and the virus got out. 70 million Chinese have been quarantined so far (the largest in Human history), upwards of a 250,000 are infected by leaked reports from Chinese Health officials (note: they have ran out of test kits, and won't be receiving anymore, so figures are unknown from this point). The virus is the perfect weapon: it kills within 2 days to a month of contraction; 50% of hosts are asymptomatic and show no signs of illness; the virus is capable of infecting up to 25 people per person; 20 year olds are now among the dead, meaning a healthy immune system and healthy body isn't enough to fight it off. If unofficial figures are true (as though the Chinese Communist Government could be trusted on anything), projections based off leaked figures see upwards of a million dead by the end of February (in China alone).

The Liberal government has refused to place a moratorium on travel from China (unsurprising), and instead opted to use thermal cameras to test for fevers on migrant arrivals. China's own health minister laughed at this proposal, stated clearly that 50%+ of hosts have no symptoms, and this screening method is doomed to fail.

Now let’s say officials worldwide do not get the coronavirus under control, and it is spread as widely as the flu. Because it is 30x more lethal (.01% vs. 3%) that would kill 30x as many. That would be 1,050,000. Over a million. 

If the official numbers are to be believed (which they’re not) 2,744 have gotten sick in a month. Estimates show the R0 of this virus could be up to 5.47, meaning for every one person sick they are likely to infect 5.47 others. (For reference, the common flu has an R0 of only 0.9-2.1) With a two week incubation, that means in two weeks alone that 2,744 could become 15,000. You can keep doing the math but the growth, undisturbed, would total in the millions infected after the year is out. And those are lowball estimates because the incubation is UP to 2 weeks and people are contagious the entire period they show symptoms. 

So this virus is very serious, and new, and officials are working to get it under control as fast as possible.

￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼

What are coronavirus infections?

Coronaviruses are a group of common viruses. They are named for the crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Some coronaviruses only affect animals, but others can also affect humans. Most people get infected with human coronaviruses at some time in their life. This usually causes mild to moderate upper-respiratory infections, like the common cold. But they can also cause more severe illnesses such as bronchitis and pneumonia.

There are several different types of human coronaviruses, including the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses.

How are coronavirus infections spread?

Human coronaviruses usually spread from an infected person to others through

The air by coughing and sneezing

Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands

Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands

Rarely, feces (poop)

Who is at risk for coronavirus infections?

Anyone can get a coronavirus infection, but young children are most likely to get infected. In the United States, infections are more common in the fall and winter.

What are the symptoms of coronavirus infections?

The symptoms depend on the type of coronavirus and how serious the infection is. If you have a mild to moderate upper-respiratory infection such as the common cold, your symptoms may include

Runny nose

Headache

Cough

Sore throat

Fever

Not feeling well overall

Some coronaviruses can cause severe symptoms. The infections may turn into bronchitis and pneumonia, which cause symptoms such as

Fever, which may be quite high if you have pneumonia

Cough with mucus

Shortness of breath

Chest pain or tightness when you breathe and cough

Severe infections are more common in people with heart or lung diseases, people with weakened immune systems, infants, and older adults.

How are coronavirus infections diagnosed?

To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will

Take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms

Do a physical exam

May do blood tests

May do lab tests of sputum, a sample from a throat swab, or other respiratory specimens

What are the treatments for coronavirus infections?

There are no specific treatments for coronavirus infections. Most people will get better on their own. However, you can relieve your symptoms by

Taking over-the-counter medicines for pain, fever, and cough. However, do not give aspirin to children. And do not give cough medicine to children under four.

Using a room humidifier or taking a hot shower to help ease a sore throat and cough

Getting plenty of rest

Drinking fluids

If you are worried about your symptoms, contact your health care provider.

Can coronavirus infections be prevented?

Right now, there aren't any vaccines to prevent human coronavirus infections. But you may able to reduce your risk of getting or spreading an infection by

Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds

Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands

Avoiding close contact with people who are sick

Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch

Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Then throw away the tissue and wash your hands.

Staying home when sick

 The continued spread of the coronavirus appears to be hitting global markets like a similar outbreak in 2003, but the history of recent health scares and market internals may mean the pullback won’t last long and investors are currently overreacting. 

 “If the outbreak follows the course of past ones this century, the global economy faces just a temporary stumble,” Michael Gregory of BMO Capital Markets said in a note to clients on Monday."

>China’s skills in certain basic public-health tasks, such as outbreak investigations, are uneven, despite its world-class genomics, virologists and gleaming hospitals, according to one person familiar with China’s public-health system.

>The stakes are enormous for China. Mr. Xi has made it a priority to revive the country’s stature on the global stage. That includes proving to the world China can handle a health problem in ways that it failed to with SARS, when 774 people died.

&#x200B;

I have been a huge Kara and Nate fan all the way back to their videos in Australia and New Zealand when I first became a subscriber. I started watching them along with Christian Leblanc when I started getting the urge to travel more. My wife and I watch them together and have seen every single video. They have been a huge inspiration to us, to the point that we are going to be traveling around the world starting in June (specific date TBD thanks to Coronavirus). I wish nothing but the best for them.

&#x200B;

That being said, hugely disappointed in how this has become less of a genuine experience, and more of a business. I don't fault them for Patreon, Fare Drop, Course sales, affiliate links, etc. because those actually provide value. They deserve to get paid through those channels. But to pull a switch and grab on the video titled ""COUNTRY #100"" is very deceitful. We feel betrayed. 

&#x200B;

We know its not a money problem. In 2018, Kara and Nate had $364K in revenue. Through August of 2019, they were at $350K and set to earn more than $500K for the year if they repeat what they did in the 3rd Quarter for 4th Quarter. I don't know about you, but that is a lot of money. Again, I get it for the value they bring on those other revenue streams, but feel betrayed that they are forcing us to pay to play essentially. 

&#x200B;

I wouldn't even feel bad if they announced that ""Patreons get early access to the video"". Or ""In addition to our normal videos, we are making a Documentary that will be available to donators"". 

&#x200B;

The innocence of K&N is gone. The lust for adventure to see the world is gone. It is now a money grab where all decisions are made to profit the Company."

>The goal? Have a vaccine ready for human testing in an unprecedented 90 days.

>NIH is partnering with a US vaccine company, Moderna, Inc.

>The vaccine is a new type called RNA. According to Reuters (“With Wuhan virus genetic code in hand, scientists begin work on a vaccine,” Jan 24, 2020), “[these are] vaccines based on ribonucleic acid (RNA)—a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins.”

>The PHG Foundation/University of Cambridge explains further: “Unlike a normal vaccine, RNA vaccines work by introducing an mRNA sequence (the molecule which tells cells what to build) which is coded for a disease specific antigen [virus]; once produced within the body, the antigen [virus] is recognised by the immune system, preparing it to fight the real thing.”

>Let’s have a look at Moderna (twitter), the company that will be making and testing the new RNA vaccine against the China coronavirus. Its website states, in a January 23rd press release: “Moderna Announces Funding Award from CEPI to Accelerate Development of Messenger RNA (mRNA) Vaccine Against Novel Coronavirus”.

>Funded by CEPI. Who is that? (twitter) Its website states: “CEPI is a innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations. We’re working together to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks.”

>A more relevant quote: “CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the World Economic Forum.”

>Bill Gates. Doesn’t that send your trust and faith rocketing up into the sky?

>There is more. Going back to the Moderna Inc. website — at the bottom of the press release referenced above, we find a VERY interesting statement, in a section titled, “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”: “…there has never been a commercial product utilizing mRNA technology approved for use…”

>And there you have it. The vaccine that is being tapped by the US government… under its National Institutes of Health…through drug company Moderna…HAS NEVER BEEN USED ON THE PUBLIC BEFORE. IT IS NOT LICENSED FOR PUBLIC USE.

>RNA VACCINES AND THE TECHNOLOGY THEY USE ARE ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL.

>AND THIS IS THE TYPE OF VACCINE BEING RUSHED INTO EXISTENCE IN 90 DAYS.

>What in the world could possibly go wrong?

>One way to find out is to unleash it on millions of people, stand back, and see.

>The PHG Foundation at the University of Cambridge gives us a substantial clue: “… better understanding of [RNA] vaccine adverse effects is needed – these can include inflammation or autoimmune reactions.”

>Autoimmune reactions—the human immune system attacks healthy elements and processes of the body itself. The body goes to war with itself.

>I’m sure you would volunteer for a test run of the vaccine, right? You would certainly offer up your child for a grand experiment, wouldn’t you?

>And if you’re a doctor reading this, you’ll definitely inject the vaccine into unsuspecting patients, won’t you? Conscience is such an annoyance, isn’t it?

>ISN’T IT?

Travelling on an aircraft is a perfect environment for transmission of these types of virus, because the air is recirculated, there are a lot of people in close proximity, and the low humidity dries out your nose mucus and reduces protection.

Now, to be clear, I don't think there's a high risk of infection in the US currently: those at risk are generally already in poor health, there are only a handful of confirmed cases in the US, none of which were in Boston or Vegas, and those people have been isolated, so it's pretty low risk currently: but we shouldn't spread misinformation such as suggesting that the coronavirus is only spread by physical contact."

Now for coronavirus the mortality rate is currently being reported as 4% which is more then 270 times higher. However if this follows what happened with SARS and MERS, China significantly underreported the number of people infected and the mortality rate ended up being much lower. 

Currently there are 44 infections reported outside of China with no deaths. Now if the mortality rate was 4% you would have expected 2 of those people to have died. So I believe it is just Chinas control of media leading to miss information. 


https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51259649

There is another thread here on Reddit where some said looking at all the WHO data the mortality is closer to 0.3% and even though it is higher then the flu is much better then the 4% being reported now. 

By Friday we will have much better data as we reach the 2 week mark on more of the infections outside China."

Because we are relying on Chinese govt data for their cases (whether they've widened case definition or if their confirmed cases are PCR positive etc, I'm not sure what they're counting), I don't think its unreasonable to make some assumptions RE pathogen epidemiology based on some knowns. 

From a personal point of view as a microbiologist:I think there is an element of panic thats been injected by the 24/7 news media but it absolutely does not mean people should be lax of personal and public hygiene control measures. I am still slightly suspicious of China's sudden response in quarantine and movement restrictions after an entire month of denying N-Cov 2019 is a public health problem. 

I will personally just be more aware of personal hygiene and where possible avoid large crowds. The important thing is not to panic.....and not be like my family and chain-forward various whatsapp messages that spread misinformation. I'll be keeping an eye the usual public health channels and biorxiv to see if anything interesting pops up.

Latest big hustle was DRIP, bought in right before the Iran strikes because I thought things would cool, then it dropped 25% during the attack and I shit my pants but it rebounded once it was determined that the strikes weren’t a big deal and then took flight once tensions began cooling. I don’t like holding over weekends, but with this Coronavirus stuff going on I bought some NUGT because gold should go up. God bless the market and compounding, absolutely beautiful things."

Eternal 'results' are all that matter. Anyway, you just explained in the same post (your opinion):

>we are eternal souls, we come to earth to increases our consciousness, to level up, my article will level up your consciousness more than anything else you could read in about 10 mins.

Respectfully, how do you know this? Or at least why do you think this?

>How do you think the saints performed their miracles?

Not sure I know what you mean by saints but God, who created everything, would have no problem performing miracles inside His own creation. 

>The coronavirus is 100% made up, its fear and despair mongering by psychos like yourself. 

It was supposed to be more of an analogy rather than literal. What if you got a deadly virus tomorrow? 

> Despair is a sin.

Believe me, there's no despair if you put your faith in Christ. He saves anyone who genuinely believes in His gift and asks to be saved. He didn't suffer and die on the cross for nothing.

>dont start weirding everybody out with fake Christ talk. Christ was a follower of the one true path of God, he did it so well they renamed the way or the system of one absolute path, Christianity.

My Book says that God in the flesh died on the cross for all our wrongdoing so we could be forgiven. Otherwise God, as a perfect being, has to judge our sin for what it is. Sin cannot enter heaven. What part of this do you disagree with? Do you think you are righteous enough, through your magic, straightness, miracles and ""Nen"" to make it into heaven on your own? If so, where did you learn that? And why do you assume it's true over what the Bible says?

It wasn’t until a feisty newspaper (whose staff were later detained for their continued dogged reporting) broke the news and a whistleblower came forward that officials publicly acknowledged the extent of the SARS outbreak. At the time, microblog platform Weibo and messaging app WeChat were still years away, people could bypass the government and share news mainly by text message.

....


Online, there has been a steady trickle of photos, videos, and witness accounts from overwhelmed hospitals that seem to undermine the state’s narrative of having the situation firmly under control. Along with reports from medical personnel, some of these grassroots accounts may have played a role in authorities moving to build temporary hospitals in Wuhan. While some hashtags and posts are quickly scrubbed by censors, others—like the hashtag #Wuhan on lockdown#—are allowed to remain, showing the government’s attempts to walk a delicate line between censorship and transparency.


...

In recent days, as the death toll climbed, China’s actions to contain the virus have intensified, as have communications from officials regarding the seriousness of the situation. China’s National Health Commission deputy director Li Bin vowed last week that the government would “disclose information on the outbreak based on facts” in a timely manner. On Saturday (Jan. 26), Chinese leader Xi Jinping said the outbreak was of “grave concern” and ordered a centralized response to tackle the epidemic.


I've pointed out some paragraphs. When it comes down to it, most of the information we are getting are based on reports from China, and they dont exactly have the best reputation for being transparent. This isn't fear mongering, this is acknowledging that things could be a lot worse than they appear to be.

Mongolia has shut down its border. North Korea  has shut down its border. Those are pretty extreme moves.

Initial symptoms are fever, dry cough, myalgia (muscle pain), and fatigue. Productive cough (a cough that produces phlegm) and headache are infrequent, hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and diarrhea occasional. It can take about a week before an infected person feels sick enough to seek medical care.


Like its siblings SARS and MERS, the new coronavirus causes pneumonia—the infection of one or both lungs. But that may be only one potential syndrome, which is one of the factors making it difficult to spot.

After this deceptively slow start, the disease progresses rapidly during the second week—in a similar fashion to SARS. Hypoxemia caused by increasing lung injury leads to difficulty breathing and the need for oxygen therapy. ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) is a common complication. Between 25 and 32 percent of cases are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation and sometimes ECMO (pumping blood through an artificial lung for oxygenation).

Other complications include septic shock, acute kidney injury, and virus-induced cardiac injury. The extensive lung damage also sets the lung up for secondary bacterial pneumonia, which occurs in 10 percent of ICU admissions. (This may also be the case for the Spanish flu of 1918, which killed 50 million people; the fatalities attributed to the viral influenza may be more because of the bacterial pneumonia that followed.)

Pneumonia from any cause severe enough to require ICU admission is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

`In 2017, as the opening of the lab approached, scientists told the publication Nature of their worries that one of those killer viruses could ‘escape’ and go on to infect members of the public.` 

`Tim Trevan, a Maryland biosafety consultant, said he had fears China’s culture could make the institute unsafe because ‘structures where everyone feels free to speak up and openness of information are important’.`

`But worries surround the Chinese lab, too.` **The SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times**`, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Tim Trevan, founder of CHROME Biosafety and Biosecurity Consulting in Damascus, Maryland, says that an open culture is important to keeping BSL-4 labs safe, and he questions how easy this will be in China, where society emphasizes hierarchy. “`**Diversity of viewpoint, flat structures where everyone feels free to speak up and openness of information are important,**`” he says.` 

 `But Ebright is not convinced of the need for more than one BSL-4 lab in mainland China.    He adds that governments will assume that such excess capacity is for the potential development of bioweapons.   “These facilities are inherently dual use,” he says. The prospect of ramping up opportunities to inject monkeys with pathogens also worries, rather than excites, him: “They can run, they can scratch, they can bite.”`"

That's the number of confirmed cases (and not just in Wuhan).

In the US, they've placed people who are possible cases in hospital isolation rooms immediately, before confirming that they have the disease.

I've no idea if they have the rooms available to do that for everyone who is suspected of having it in China and is waiting for testing completion, but I'd imagine that they'd do so for as many as they have the reasonable ability to do it for, as it'd help limit the spread.  After all, the question right now, whether the disease can be contained, is one of whether the rate of new infections can be cut below the rate at which people recover/die.

Not to mention, as others point out, that it's not as if the entire hospital capacity of Wuhan is devoted solely to 2019-nCoV patients."

> The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei province, including Wuhan city, climbed from 56 to 76 overnight, health commission officials said, with four deaths elsewhere in China.

> Chinese National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said on Sunday the incubation period could range from one to 14 days, and that the virus was infectious during incubation, which was not the case with SARS. The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.

Sure. it CAN be deadly to people who can't fight off the disease due to some pre existing condition (The very young and old, and those immunocomprimised) But the disease itself is not inherently that deadly. Look at the symptoms of the coronavirus: 

&#x200B;

 Common human coronaviruses, including types 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold. Most people get infected with these viruses at some point in their lives. These illnesses usually only last for a short amount of time. Symptoms may include

* runny nose
* headache
* cough
* sore throat
* fever
* a general feeling of being unwell

Human coronaviruses can sometimes cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. This is more common in people with cardiopulmonary disease, people with weakened immune systems, infants, and older adults.

[source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/symptoms.html)

This is basically just an UPI (Upper Respiratory Infection)

The reason the coronavirus is huge news is because of our inability to control it. We have zero immunities to it at this point (its a 'new' disease or mutation of SARS) so if you're exposed to it, there is a GREAT likelihood that you will get sick. For a normal person with a normal immune system, your body will fight it and you'll be fine after a week; With most illnesses, we build antibodies against them or get vaccines to prevent them. Whenever something mutates there is no vaccine against it, so those who could die from getting it are not protected from herd immunity. 

So the media hype over the now Pandemic is really all just that - Hype. The flu virus kills 464,000 people a year. 

We really have nothing to worry about."

774 dead from 8.098 infected = .09 fatality rate in the end 

Yes that’s bad. But that was the final count for that period. 

It’s been only 2 weeks now and there is 80 dead out of 2700 in 2 WEEKS.

the treatment you are referring to is currently being tested to treat the symptoms of the coronavirus. That is also sourced from the Chinese government who are hiding the true numbers of how many people are sick and dead in Wuhan. They are saying anything to make themselves looks good. Current citizens of Wuhan are right now being turned away from hospitals because there are no more beds/rooms and being told to go home and wait. They are being told there is no treatment or being sent home with antibiotics. I have family in areas nearby like Chengdu who have quarantined themselves because of how crazy it is there.

If the flu was worse do you think this shit would be like how it is now?"

It was easier to contain, and as such China was able to lock down the information about the virus during the first few months. It took like 3 - 4 months, and a whistleblower-Doctor in Beijing before the news about the actual numbers of the virus reached outside of China.

The spread of this virus appears to be more publicly released this time, which means that the initial spread of the virus is more visible on the international stage when its exciting and new; not four months into a slow-leak of ""limited"" cases from a foreign nation.

SARS also got a large reaction, but it wasn't as intense because the public had more time to get used to the idea that the new virus existed, before its spread was monitored as closely (by international media).

To be clear, both SARS and this novel coronavirus are serious health issues - but the hysteria we are seeing is part of a symptom of the novelty-freshness of the Wuhan virus."

It’s only been 2 weeks since we even knew about the coronavirus and there’s over 2700 confirmed people with it and 80 CONFIRMED deaths- media outlets in China reports even more high numbers. 

SARS didn’t spread this fast. And didn’t have this long of a incubation period. 

If you give me a 5-10% of the world population getting the flu every year and 200-300k people die .... the coronavirus is still WAY WAY worse then the flu. 

We also don’t have a treatment for the coronavirus. If you have the flu- you go and get tamiflu or stay at home sick- with this- there’s nothing and if you do nothing there’s a high chance you will die- MUCH higher chance then the flu. 

Again- YES a lot of people die from the flu.
But it won’t be as much as this thing if we keep brushing this off like it’s not as bad as the flu.

Obviously still not an ideal situation and we should all take precautions but it's FAR from the deadly pandemic you and some other unhelpful people are making it out to be thanks to modern containment practices (that we learnt from the Spanish Flu), the relative poor infectivity of the coronavirus and fairly early detection.

china is doing their best considering the population of the country and the population density found in some of these affected cities. 

honestly though, being a nurse & having read the recent cdc pathology report out of boredom, the coronavirus is p much glorified flu virus that will pretty much only kill the elderly / immunocompromised- and to boot it is currently harder to spread than the common flu or something like measles. 

for reference, the flu infected 13 million americans in 2019, hospitalized like ~125,000 americans, and killed about ~7,000 americans, for a population of like 335 million people, compared to china, which has ~1.4 billion people. 

nobody however is shitting on the US and their treatment of flu patients [although people consider stuff like the flu shot to be very annoying] or doctors in the US despite the large number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths- which would seem extreme to the average person who finds out about it- but it's really not a big deal statistically, yknow."

I'm not going to duplicate the efforts of every major news organisation out there that's providing beat-to-beat updates about every new confirmed case, every statement, etc. Instead, I've picked through a few key things that I think clinicians should be aware of.

* [Hong Kong University](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1505090-20200127.htm?spTabChangeable=0) has held a press conference during which the dean of the university's medical school provided their estimate for latest true infection numbers in Wuhan city (44,000 infected, 25,000 of those demonstrating symptoms only in Wuhan). This compares to the overnight mainland official tally of 2,744 cases, with 80 case fatalities and 461 reported to be in 'critical' condition. As I've mentioned before, the scale of China's response seems discongruous with the official numbers. 769 (28%) of the official cases were confirmed in the last 24 hours.

Prof Leung's team estimated an R0 of 2.13. With HKU's numbers, the doubling rate for incidence is roughly six days. Given this, in the absence of control success, the outbreak is expected to peak within 6-8 weeks in Asia; HKU also suggested strongly that the lockdown was too late. Perhaps most tellingly was the reply Prof Leung gave to a question about what could be done for major mainland cities that aren't yet affected:

>*...the Hong Kong government should not really try to answer [that] question (should we do more about Chinese major urban areas at risk) but rather answer how can we sustain Hong Kong's food supply, Hong Kong's ability and capacity to deal with a major epidemic.*

* Chinese authorities have extended the national Lunar New Year celebrations (a public holiday) for an additional week; this is a bit like making New Year's Eve a weeklong holiday. This has obvious benefits in keeping people at home instead of community to work, but is not an easy decision to make given the loss of perhaps 1/52nd of a year's output. Suspensions to long-distance bus services, which remain the cheapest way for people to travel between cities in China, have been expanded.

* The global economic effects are a fairly good barometer for the anticipated severity of the international and consumer *response* (but not necessarily the true severity of the outbreak). The FTSE is down 110 points (1.5%), the Nikkei had its biggest fall (2%) in five months, and Brent crude is down $1.3 (2.2%) to below $60/barrel. These are small percentages but actually represent rather large movements. Investors are flocking to perceived 'safe havens' - precious metals, stable currencies like the Swiss franc, etc.

* Confirmed cases are being [published by the AP](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jan/27/coronavirus-china-death-toll-climbs-to-80-with-more-than-2700-cases-live-updates?page=with:block-5e2e87588f08e97ed212afc9#block-5e2e87588f08e97ed212afc9). Human-to-human transmission outside of China has been confirmed. The USA and Australia have each reached 5 cases, France has three, and Japan has four. The UK's suspected cases have all tested negative, but England’s chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said there was a ""*fair chance*"" cases would emerge in the UK. I suspect over this week we will find that countries have unwittingly imported incubating patients over the last week, and that what we'll see is a rise in these numbers as those who were asymptomatic become unwell. This has major implications for frontline staff; isolation and extended travel histories (including travel histories of close contacts) are very important.

* The WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has flown to Beijing and will spend today in meetings with Chinese government officials. A statement is expected along with the sitrep this evening.

* A live feed of the massive construction project of a new field hospital in Wuhan [is available](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ypKdQbavRqGW).

* JHU CSSE has posted a [new model](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov-model/) which agrees with HKU that the true number of cases is much higher than reported:

>For 40 cases to have been exported out of the country, we believe the number of 2019-nCoV cases in mainland China are likely much higher than that reported throughout January. Specifically, we estimate there to be around 20,000 cases of 2019-nCoV in mainland China on January 25 (at which time closer to 2000 were reported).

It's worth a line for the caveat that there are (of course) unavoidable assumptions limitations with any model, including this one. There's enormous difficulty with the quality and accuracy of official information being provided. Instead of being able to extrapolate from true historic data, experts are having to fit a model retrospectively to surrogate measures of outbreak spread that can be trusted (exported cases) before making predictions.

In view all of the above, I think this next week will be fairly critical in terms of:

1. determining the success of control measures - does the R change with the lockdown?
1. determining the extent of the asymptomatic spread - who's been incubating the virus this week and where?
1. determining the true extent of the outbreak in China, and the natural history of the disease.
1. if the above are unfavourable, making preparations for the possibility of containment failure in key areas. This is preparation, not panic.

As I've said before, this is a situation that is unlikely to imminently affect the average medditor. However, public health experts are increasingly pressing for acceptance of the possibility that this will land on our doorsteps. Panic at any stage is notably unhelpful, and right now there's not a lot any individual can do. This is not a freight train barreling towards your stalled car on the level crossing. However, spreading awareness and running departmental thought exercises or sims, FUO/fever in a returning traveler drills, and familiarising yourself with PPE is never unwise. I'd suggest that this subreddit's clinicians in unaffected areas are more likely to do good at this stage with emphasis on hand hygiene and good travel histories than anything else at this time. As always, stay tuned.

As a final note, please don't [do this](https://twitter.com/EP_Lawrence/status/1221674006664773632)."

Based on the data we now have coming in, I think many of us this sub would now agree that we're at the beginning of a global pandemic.   


Sustained human-to-human transmission, a R rate between 2 and 5.13, between 44,000 and 100,000 already infected, and a 'doubling rate' of six days. If we take his data point of 44,000 as of three days ago, we are very close to our [other estimate](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/26/coronavirus-could-infect-100000-globally-experts-warn) of 100,000 already infected.  


With 20,000 people already having travelled into India from China, there's a high possibility of it spreading there already. [Yesterday I posted a scenario](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/euc884/more_than_20000_passengers_returning_to_india/) which at a conservative estimate put 4 infected people in India as of 19th of January. It was based on there being **2000 infected people** in a city of 9,000,000 (0.02%). I was criticised (by some) for estimating a 0.5% infection rate in Wuhan. Using the numbers we have today, that infection rate rises to 0.5% - 44,000 people in a city 9,000,000. If you apply that rate to [the 20,000 people we know have travelled to India](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-11-including-7-from-kerala-under-watch-in-india-over-wuhan-virus-fears-2169421) since the outbreak, that's 100 infected people in India as of 19th of January.  


With a doubling rate of six days, its possible there are already 200 infected people in India, which is going to be very difficult to contain.   


We will have to see how it plays out of course - the doubling rate of six days does slow things somewhat. Is this accurate? Because yesterday we had 1400 cases, and today we are at 2500 cases, which suggests a doubling rate which is shorter than six days.  In any case, the data we have coming in is now highly indicative that a global pandemic is possible. It all depends on how the virus mutates/changes from here on out."

Until the 21st century, the worst a coronavirus, a large family of viruses capable of infecting humans and animals, could do to humans was to deliver the common cold—annoying but hardly sinister. But three times so far in the 21st century, novel coronaviruses have emerged that could potentially cause a deadly pandemic—SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) in 2012, and now 2019-nCoV emanating from Wuhan, China. As of Jan. 26, the new coronavirus has reportedly infected at least 2,463 people and caused at least 80 deaths. Those numbers are certain to mushroom.

Controlling the spread of the virus requires both public health and medical measures—and for that we need a clear clinical profile. At this stage, that information is only just being put together, but what we do have is disturbing.

So far, the limited clinical information coming out of China means we know only about the mid-to-worst-case outcomes—from moderate to life-threatening pneumonia. Two studies released on Jan. 24—one about 41 infected patients and the other on a family cluster of six separate from those 41—provide both clues and concerns.

The official story is that this new coronavirus emerged from a Wuhan wet market, where live animals that would never normally meet in the wild live side by side, facilitating trans-species mutation of pathogens. Yet the first three known cases from Dec. 1 and 2 were not linked to the market. Neither were 11 more cases of the 41 reviewed in the recent study. This early data suggests an evolving virus that surfaced considerably earlier. Undetected among the plethora of similar chest infections and common symptoms, it honed its capacity to spread from human to human. As happened with SARS, new corona may be mutating along the way, gradually becoming more virulent.

The coronavirus is a physically large virus—in relative terms, at just 125 nanometers with a surface of spike projections, too big to survive or stay suspended in the air for hours or travel more than a few feet. Like influenza, this coronavirus spreads through both direct and indirect contact. Direct contact occurs through the physical transfer of the microorganism among friends and family through close contact with oral secretions. Indirect contact results when an infected person coughs or sneezes, spreading coronavirus droplets on nearby surfaces, including knobs, bedrails, and smartphones.

As with SARS, droplets generated during medical procedures such as bronchoscopy and respiratory treatment may be aerosolized, infecting multiple medical staff and enabling super-spreading. Hand hygiene and personal protective barriers—gowns, gloves, masks, and goggles—reduce droplet transmission. The incubation period, however, is unknown but currently very roughly estimated as between one and 14 days.

To complicate matters further, we do not know how easily the new coronavirus spreads. Can transmission take place before the onset of symptoms? (Measles, one of the most contagious diseases on Earth, is infectious two to four days beforehand.) Do people who never become symptomatic nonetheless spread the disease? Do symptomatic people become less contagious over time, like SARS, or is it like Ebola, which becomes increasingly contagious as the disease progresses? These are all unanswered questions.

Like its siblings SARS and MERS, the new coronavirus causes pneumonia—the infection of one or both lungs. But that may be only one potential syndrome, which is one of the factors making it difficult to spot. In fact, it probably causes a spectrum of disease, from asymptomatic to lethal. Even in deadly cases, new coronavirus infections start off much like many other less dangerous diseases. Initial symptoms are fever, dry cough, myalgia (muscle pain), and fatigue. Productive cough (a cough that produces phlegm) and headache are infrequent, hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and diarrhea occasional. It can take about a week before an infected person feels sick enough to seek medical care.

    Like its siblings SARS and MERS, the new coronavirus causes pneumonia—the infection of one or both lungs. But that may be only one potential syndrome, which is one of the factors making it difficult to spot.
After this deceptively slow start, the disease progresses rapidly during the second week—in a similar fashion to SARS. Hypoxemia caused by increasing lung injury leads to difficulty breathing and the need for oxygen therapy. ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) is a common complication. Between 25 and 32 percent of cases are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation and sometimes ECMO (pumping blood through an artificial lung for oxygenation).

Other complications include septic shock, acute kidney injury, and virus-induced cardiac injury. The extensive lung damage also sets the lung up for secondary bacterial pneumonia, which occurs in 10 percent of ICU admissions. (This may also be the case for the Spanish flu of 1918, which killed 50 million people; the fatalities attributed to the viral influenza may be more because of the bacterial pneumonia that followed.)

Pneumonia from any cause severe enough to require ICU admission is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Defined as an infection of one or both lungs, it was already considered an ancient disease in Hippocrates’s time. In 1881, pneumococcus—the main cause of bacterial pneumonia—was finally identified. Over the next century, medical advances and the development of antibiotics made treatment possible, honed by intensivists to reduce the mortality rate to single figures.

In contrast, because few respiratory viruses cause more than mild infection, adult intensive care physicians generally have relatively little experience with viral pneumonia. Yet infection by SARS, H1N1, and MERS can lead to severe pneumonitis, ARDS, and respiratory failure, possibly because of an exaggerated inflammatory reaction. (Corticosteroids, the go-to anti-inflammatory drug, are ineffective and not recommended by the World Health Organization, or WHO.) The lack of effective antivirals and treatment options means viral pneumonia has a high mortality rate.

We do not know how lethal the new coronavirus is. While the single figures of deaths in early January seemed reassuring, the death toll has now climbed to above 3 percent. This may indicate better reporting—or the lethal lag time (the time for those infected to die). Another big unknown is the risk factors that would lead infection in a deadly direction. Certainly, some adults have compromised immune systems due to chronic illnesses. Of these, 15 percent have died, with higher fatality rates among older patients and those with co-morbidities of diabetes, hypertension, or coronary artery disease. However, most patients with severe illness were healthy to begin with, including a 30-year-old man who recently died.

While I’m not certain that the new strain has the same effect, I am certain that little is known about it. The 2002 Coronavirus strand that broke out in Guangdong Province, China was the strand that was contained and tested on animals. Those who died of the 2002 strand were also studied.

Tills de är friska eller döda räknas de bara in i siffran ""bekräftade fall"", men den är ju implicit ""smittad-men-inte-död"" vilket trycker ner dödligheten (siffran) tills det att hela sjukdomsförloppet är klart (ännu en sak vi inte vet ännu, men det pratas om inkubationstid på 2 veckor)."

It is understandable to be concerned about novel viruses. However, it is known that the death rate, although higher than ordinary flu, is lower than SARS or the Spanish flu. If you are a healthy person and practice good hygiene then you face a very low risk. Frankly, the coronavirus panic and emphasis on good hygiene may well help stop the transmission of regular flu, which will be a welcome bonus.

The most recent numbers I've seen estimate death by the coronavirus to occur a week or more after first symptoms. 

14% of the original group of 41 patients died from the disease. This can't be generally applied because apparently most of these 41 patients were of an advanced age, and are not representative of overall demographics.

20% of cases were officially described as ""severe"" when compared against the total number of officially reported cases. This can't be generally applied because the officially reported cases do not include the potentially very large number of people being turned away from hospitals, or never showing up at all, due to never experiencing more than minor symptoms. 

60% of patients died when considering number of officially reported deaths versus the sum of officially reported deaths and full recoveries. This can't be generally applied because it likely considers only or primarily cases that were severe enough in the first place to require hospitalization and testing.

**We just don't know.** There is too little credible information available to make any statements about the coronavirus' mortality rate except that it could range anywhere from as low as the flu to as high as 60%. We will probably not have the information needed to make a reliable estimate for another week or two."

That’s simply false. SARS case fatality rate was 11%, we currently don’t have a case fatality rate for coronavirus, as there’s not enough information. From the hospital’s confirmed cases, the fatality rate is 16%. Its likely the case fatality rate is lower, but we don’t know yet. Add to this that coronavirus is spreading far faster than SARS ever did, where SARS throughout its lifetime had 8000~ confirmed cases and coronavirus is already at 2000~ cases, with many more suspected. 

You’re proving my point by purporting to have information that no one does. The case fatality rate isn’t known yet, the infection fatality rate isn’t known yet. The R0 isn’t known yet, the levels of asymptomatic transmission isn’t known yet, a vaccine or cure isn’t known yet

It sounds like you're scared and that's fair considering the mass hysteria from news outlets. Here's the link to the CDC's website on the virus outbreak:  [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html). When it comes to outbreaks like this, you're better off reading what the CDC says than CNN. I can see how you're dad thought your question was insensitive, but also why you were worried. So if you have concerns, just follow what the CDC says, replace ""coronavirus"" with ""upper respiratory infection that is potentially dangerous for people who are already immunocompromised"" in your head when you see news articles about it and get your flu shot. IMO, that's what I would do."

> the death toll from the virus has risen to 81, with more than 2,700 affected. Of those who have been infected, more than 400 are in a critical condition

This doesn’t include asymptomatic carriers or people who WILL develop symptoms. Betting on under-reporting and under-detection. 

Another reddit user in r/news said [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/euhlp6/comment/ffprq2d)

>Also the type of pneumonia that is triggered is closer to an immune response than normal pneumonia. This is why with the coronavirus, pneumonia is found on both lungs rather than one lung for normal pneumonia. Simply put, it’s the patient’s own immune system attacking their lungs that’s causing the pneumonia.

>This would imply that stronger, healthier people would suffer more from the pneumonia once it’s triggered, although we do not know why it is triggered in the first place. Also why AIDS medication seems to work a bit on the pneumonia patients [who have this virus].
