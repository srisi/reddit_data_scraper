This is what this post implies, and it is false.

In other words, people going outside (people NOT social distancing) actually shortens the length of the pandemic... but it causes more people to be infected at the same time and hospitals won't be able to help everybody.

**It's unintuitive, but social distancing extends the length of the pandemic.** In this case, people will be infected over a longer period of time and fewer people will be infected at the same time. This allows hospitals to better accommodate the infected. This means overall fewer people will die, and this is what we want (until we get a vaccine).

>For the past few weeks, state health department officials have been working with an expert task force of physicians, researchers and mathematicians from local universities to try to predict how the novel coronavirus spreading across the world might progress locally. 
>
>The group of specialists provided three reports to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, as of the end of last week, and Gov. Jared Polis presented some of the findings of the experts during a press conference Friday, March 27. Polis relayed some stark estimates during the press conference, with possible COVID-19 deaths in Colorado ranging from 900 to 33,200.
>
>But CDPHE has so far refused to make public what the experts from the University of Colorado School of Public Health, School of Medicine and the University of Colorado at Boulder provided. And the agency has given conflicting explanations for why they won’t allow the public to see it. 
>
>During an April 2 web-streaming press conference, Scott Bookman, CDPHE’s COVID-19 incident commander, said the expert research gives them reason to believe that the number of COVID-19 cases in Colorado is between four and 10 times higher than what’s currently known.
>
>But in response to why the state decided not to allow the public to see the experts’ work, Bookman said, “I think it's important to understand that there are a number of different models out there. It's also really important to understand that any model we're using is a single snapshot, and every time we learn more information about the impact of our social distancing—the impact on the spread of disease in our community.” Bookman said the slides Gov. Polis presented were made available. 
>
>CDPHE did not respond to a written request to clarify their response to address why the decision not to make the model or documents related to it available to the public.
>
>But CDPHE’s records manager provided a different explanation. In a response to a formal request under the Colorado Open Records Act, which broadly classifies government records as disclosable upon request with some exceptions, CDPHE didn’t raise the “number of different models out there” or that it was “a single snapshot.” 
>
>CDPHE’s records manager told Colorado Politics that they needed to delay the release of the records because of “extenuating circumstances.” Colorado public records law allows government agencies to spend up to seven days in addition to the three days allowed by law to produce copies of public records, when they’re formally requested. 
>
>But the “extenuating circumstances” provision of Colorado law allows the extra seven days only when a request is broad, voluminous or insufficiently specific, or if the records are impossible to compile within three days, or if, “an impending deadline or period of peak demand that is either unique or not predicted to recur more frequently than once a month” requires “all or substantially all” of the agency’s resources. Despite added complications or “peak demand” to the state health department due to work associated with the spread of the coronavirus, the agency has processed other formal records requests in recent days and weeks — just not for the expert research provided by the university task force.
>
>Jeff Roberts, the executive director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition, said the state health department should, especially in times when providing information can mean the health of Coloradans, provide access to reports that are compiled and complete. And they should provide them proactively, he said. 
>
>“The extenuating circumstances is understandable in this time, for records that really do have to be compiled and gone over for privilege, but if we’re talking about reports that are done, and they know what’s in these reports, then I would say that information should be provided in an expeditious way to the public and the journalists working to informing the public,” Roberts said. “And I would add the health department should be providing this proactively, without having to use a request. If there’s anything that’s privileged, then they should redact that, prior to proactive release.”
>
>The agency has not responded to requests to explain why their records manager and their crisis manager gave different answers to why the state is keeping the records secret for now."

but a very high enough concentration of 5G can actually harm you; 5G is just energy, your body can absorb that energy and it can heat up water inside you. except, there isn't any high concentrations of it. for example, imagine a 5G tower as a \~200W LED light bulb. it's extremely bright up close, but as you move not even that far away it becomes very dim. thats why its dangerous to go near, really any radio tower for long periods.

>*The first thing to say is that if Derby County needed me to take a pay cut to save the club I would understand and look to support them in whatever way I could. And if the government approached me to help support nurses financially or buy ventilators I’d be proud to do so — as long as I knew where the money was going.*  
>  
>*But I’m not every player. I’m 34, I’ve had a long career and I’ve earned well. I’m in a place where I could give something up. Not every footballer is in the same position. Yet suddenly the whole profession has been put on the spot with a demand for 30 per cent pay cuts across the board. Why are footballers suddenly the scapegoats?*  
>  
>*How the past few days have played out is a disgrace. First the health secretary, Matt Hancock, in his daily update on coronavirus, said that Premier League players should take a pay cut. He was supposed to be giving the nation the latest on the biggest crisis we’ve faced in our lifetimes. Why was the pay of footballers even in his head? Was he desperate to divert attention from his government’s handling of this pandemic?*  
>  
>*The Premier League then announced it was looking for its players to give up or defer wages by 30 per cent. This despite owners and the Premier League board knowing players were already deep in discussion about what their contribution should be. It seemed strange to me because every other decision in this process has been kept behind closed doors, but this had to be announced publicly. Why? It feels as if it’s to shame the players — to force them into a corner where they have to pick up the bill for lost revenue.*  
>  
>*The EFL will probably wait to see what is agreed at Premier League level and so, as Derby captain, I might face similar discussions to those Premier League captains, who were asked to agree reductions on behalf of their whole squad. But as a captain, how would I know the financial background of my team-mates?*  
>  
>*The Championship is different from the Premier League. We have one player who lives with his mum on a council estate — not that that matters — who I imagine has responsibility for paying the bills for his whole family. He’s a footballer but he’s facing the same circumstances as lots of people in our country today.*  
>  
>*He’s a youngster and hasn’t had time to build up any security to fall back on. A cut might be fine for me but what about him? Thirty per cent of £2,000-a-week would lose him £600 — and that could be what his family needs to live on. Remember, players’ careers are short so they have to make investments or have savings, with most facing retirement at 35 but — unlike a previous generation — unable to draw a pension until much later.*  
>  
>*Of course, Premier League pay in most cases is higher but there will be younger players who just aren’t on the kind of money where they can be forced to lose 30 per cent. And, like everyone else in the world, footballers spend according to their means. Some players will buy houses they can’t really afford, some buy cars they don’t need. Whether that’s right or wrong, it’s the reality. When I was a kid at Everton I bought a £20,000 Audi before I had the money because that’s the kind of daft thing you do at that age. What would have happened to me? Then you have all the players with family members being laid off and who will be under even more pressure to support them.*  
>  
>*I get that players are well paid and could give up money. But this should be getting done on a case-by-case basis. Clubs should be sitting down with each player and explaining what savings it needs to survive. Players would accept that. One player might say, “I can afford a 30 per cent cut”; another might say, “I can only afford 5 per cent.” Personally, I’d have no problem with some of us paying more. I don’t think that would cause any dressing room problems.*  
>  
>*At Derby we’re keeping in touch about what we can contribute to our local community and especially those affected by, or at the front line of, coronavirus. Some players are saying they can afford to do something, some are saying they can’t afford to do anything. We all respect that.*  
>  
>*For the Premier League to just announce the proposal, as it has done, increases the pressure on players and in my opinion it is now a no-win situation: if players come out and say they can’t agree or are not willing to cut by 30 per cent, even if the real reasons are that it will financially ruin some, it will be presented as “Rich Players Refuse Pay Cut”.*  
>  
>*Whatever way you look at it, we’re easy targets. What gets lost is that half our wages get taken by the taxman. Money that goes to the government, money that is helping the NHS.*  
>  
>*And what about the big stars from other sports, who are able to avoid tax by living in places like Monaco — why are they not getting called out? Why aren’t all the wealthy being forced to contribute extra? Wouldn’t that raise more money?*  
>  
>*It shouldn’t be forgotten footballers already give a lot of money to charity. We help our communities. I don’t like talking about what I’ve done but throughout my career I’ve always contributed to charities that mean something to me. This disaster is hitting the whole world. We’re all human beings. Becoming targets like this I feel is wrong. I’m worried for some of the players, especially the young ones.*  
>  
>*The big clubs don’t need players to take pay cuts. Are you telling me Manchester United or Man City need 30 per cent of their players’ wages to survive? If that’s the case then football is in a far worse position than any of us imagined.*  
>  
>*If it’s not about club survival, but about diverting money to important causes I know from my own experience in lots of dressing rooms that the players are always the first to say we need to do something about this. We have to remember footballers here come from all over the world and some players will have different ideas what they would do with any money they have given up. You have African players who, I have no doubt, would rightly want to support their homelands and I’m sure that’s true of a lot of foreign players. Shouldn’t that be respected?*  
>  
>*As I understand it, the Premier League is putting £20 million towards the NHS and that should be applauded but in reality that’s a drop in the ocean compared to the £500 million the PFA say the clubs would save by wage reductions.*  
>  
>*I know that in writing this people will point the finger at me and say, “Oh you’ve earned all this money in your career.” I know there’ll be implications for me. But I’m not talking about me personally. I’m talking about footballers, people I have shared dressing rooms with. The pressure put on them is not acceptable and I need to speak up for them. At the moment it’s almost a free-for-all: it’s like the government, Premier League and sections of the media have set the players up to fall.*"

There's no mention of the reports that China has and continues to downplay the impact and threat of the virus.  This article indicates the white house could have easily predicted what was going to happen but that assertion is flawed considering China's attempts at misinformation.

This is the AP, it generally doesn’t get much more neutral than that. China certainly tried to suppress information about the coronavirus early on, but by late January they were giving out enough information that it was clearly a serious issue. If nothing else, China’s lockdown of the entire Hubei province to stop the spread of the virus should have been a clear tip off. That was on Jan 23. 

Italy started seeing rapid growth of coronavirus cases in mid-to-late February, yet the federal government didn’t place its first orders for masks until mid March. Let’s give the administration the benefit of the doubt and say that despite widely available information, China’s obfuscation completely tricked them. By February there were cases all over the world in other countries which showed the scale and severity of the problem. Why did it take another month to act?

> The article also talked about trump being at odds with media reporting but the media has attacked trump since before he announced his run for president. Why would anyone think he would all of a sudden start trusting the very organization that has been against him for so long?

Trump was at odds with the media, scientists and medical experts, and with US intelligence reports. What else is new, right? This is exactly the problem. Again let’s give trump the benefit of the doubt. The media has been super-duper mean to him and he doesn’t trust them. He also doesn’t trust government scientists. He also doesn’t trust intelligence reports. Trumps reliance on his inner circle for information continues to be an inexcusable problem. 

> The last part is the idea that the federal government should have stepped in earlier rather than letting the states take the lead.  When was the last time the Fed stepped in and declared an emergency, enacted the defense act, prior to an emergency actually happening?  The idea there should have been more federal action makes sense in hindsight but the timeline the article uses implies immediate recognition of the viruses threat.


The emergency was the rapidly spreading virus. We knew it was highly contagious from early reports, and monitoring the spread in China, Italy, Europe, and even the US. When we had early, isolated cases one person would infect a cluster very quickly. This happened in the nursing home Washington and in New Rochelle in NY. 

I don’t know the history of federal government emergency declarations but state governments routinely declare an emergency when a hurricane is en route in order to free up funds and supplies for a proactive, immediate response. In this case, PPE prevents the spread of the virus, particularly among health care workers who are in short supply. It is asinine to wait for enough doctors to be out sick before we respond with PPE to protect the rest. 

> I absolutely think the administration could have done better and most of the poor choices stem from the advisors trump will listen to.  However, all factors have to be looked at and not skimmed over because people hate trump.

Thank you for ending with this because we’re in excellent agreement here (and I like to agree). I will say though I don’t think there were sufficient mitigating factors to remotely excuse the administration’s response or lack thereof."

Was just informed via phone call that I tested positive for Coronavirus and let me tell you: this infection was the weakest shit I've ever dealt with in my life. The flu/ pneumonia is so much worse. I killed this virus in two days flat. Was doing two hour home workouts by the 4th day. I stayed home and self-quarantined. The people who are dying are either very old, have compromised immune systems or just aren't taking the proper precautions. My parents have it now too, are following my instructions and are fine as well.

The key to fighting this infection: 4000mg Vitamin C, L-Lysine for respiratory health, elderberry gummies, multivitamins, fish oil, gallon of water daily, etc.

But you are allowed to go to church in person, and that is not breaking the rules. If they're open for Easter, then I would expect a pretty big spike in deaths in May, as we saw with Mardi Gras in New Orleans.

There are a lot of people obeying the other rules here, but there are also a lot of people who aren't taking it seriously at all. Not sure how that compares to elsewhere.

Florida deaths are doubling every 3 days, which seems to be pretty middle-of-the-pack. We're helped by the fact that overall population density is lower than the places you mention. Also, we have a relatively high number of hospital beds per capita than many other states (iirc), though that won't be a factor for several weeks. There are a lot of other variables working for and against us, average age, and the weather, to name a few. But whatever the case is, deaths and confirmed cases are both increasing exponentially, just like everywhere else.

If there’s occultism in the industry as well as pedophilia I’m sure he’s aware of stuff simply because of all the people in the industry that he knows that may have brought it up before.

Seth MacFarlane from family guy makes jokes all the time such as about Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey for years and people in the audience just laugh as it’s basically an open secret. 

So seeing things that are that dark and abusive can take a toll on you especially when you can’t say anything or risk being killed or something else crazy like that.

Adam Sandler strikes me as someone who hides in his house all day or hangs out with his friends, so he is probably not in big crazy social circles but given his wealth and how long he has been in that industry and how well known he is.

Researchers at Monash University and Alfred Health have developed a rapid test to determine a person’s immunity to Covid-19.


>The test will indicate who remains infectious and the severity of Covid-19 if a person was to get it.
Cell samples will begin arriving from the three coronavirus hotspots – Italy, China and New York – as well as sufferers from Melbourne, from next week.
The test will also look for differences in the blood of patients with a mild disease compared to those with a severe infection to find biomarkers to predict who needs early medical treatment.


>Experts repurposed influenza and allergy testing tech­nol­ogy to create the rapid test, which will involve a blood test.


>“This and other tests like it will provide us with a more nuanced approach to managing the disease,” lead researcher Associate Professor Menno van Zelm, from Monash University’s Central Clinical School, said on Monday.


>The test, similar to that for influenza, looks at memory B lymphocytes which are immune system cells that make antibodies to fight pathogens such as viruses.
The cells remember the same pathogens for a faster fight in the future, and are formed after vaccination.
If there is evidence of a large population of the cells specific to a pathogen, it is likely a person has been infected in the past.

>A customer of a Sherbrooke Walmart dissatisfied with the social distancing rules imposed in the store tried to kill a security guard by rushing at him with his car, before fleeing.

>The event occurred around 5:00 p.m. Saturday night. At that time, the client, a 25-year-old man, came to the store with his wife. However, Walmart management accepts only one customer at a time per vehicle, in order to limit the number of people in the establishment during this pandemic period, explained Sherbrooke police on Sunday.

>A security guard intervened and the couple left the store, but continued the argument in the parking lot. Then, the man, driving his vehicle, rushed on the agent, dragging him on his hood for several meters, before making a maneuver to throw him on the ground. The suspect then fled.

>The worker suffered serious head injuries and was still fighting for his life on Sunday morning.

>The driver, for his part, was found in a home in Sherbrooke and arrested during the evening. ""He is facing charges of armed assault with a vehicle, aggravated assault and a hit and run,"" said police, adding that he was scheduled to appear on Sunday.

>The agent's employer, TITAN Security, denounced this ""tragic incident"" caused by an ""enraged customer"".

>""We are deeply saddened by this unprovoked aggression in times of national crisis where we are all trying to enforce the urgent regulations implemented by our government,"" the company said on its Facebook page on Sunday.

>A crowdfunding campaign was launched on the Tiing site to help the worker and his family. It had raised more than $ 400 at 11 a.m. Sunday morning.

>TITAN Security also promised to support its employee and his family.

>For his part, the director of the Sherbrooke Police Service, Danny McConnell, launched an “appeal for calm” with his fellow citizens affected by the coronavirus crisis.

>""I urge people to respect officers and employees who just enforce basic rules for your protection,"" said McConnell in a statement.

* **April 5, 2020Updated** **5:30 a.m. ET**

DUBAI — Warring factions in Yemen accused each other on Sunday of attacking an oil pipeline pumping station in the central province of Marib, where clashes have raged for weeks and displaced tens of thousands of civilians.

The oil ministry of the internationally-recognized, Saudi-backed government in Yemen said on Sunday the Iran-aligned Houthi group had targeted the station, according to the Saudi state news agency (SPA).

Hussein al-Ezzi, an official in the Houthi-controlled government based in the capital Sanaa since 2014, said Saudi-led coalition forces had attacked the Kofel pumping station in what he described as a dangerous escalation.

Both sides gave no details of the reported attack.

The pipeline is operated by the Yemeni government-owned Safer oil company but no oil has been pumped through it for years.

Yemen's oil output has collapsed since 2015 when a Saudi-led military coalition intervened in the war to try to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power after it was ousted by Houthi forces in Sanaa.

The United Nations and Western powers hope the threat posed by the global coronavirus pandemic will push Yemen's combatants into fresh talks to end a largely stalemated war that has left millions vulnerable to disease and starvation."

That being said, I did not find that this interview gave us ""both sides of the story.""  He gave us PeaceHealth's side of the story.    

Per the [LA times article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-04-03/fired-coronavirus-doctor) on Dr. Lin:  

""He called for drive-through testing for the coronavirus, faster turnaround of test results and screening of patients and staff as they entered the facility.

Subsequent [posts](https://www.facebook.com/minglin) said that nurses were given gowns offering little protection and that some had been told not to wear masks.

He said the hospital, where he had worked for 17 years, lacked an area where workers could disinfect to avoid carrying the virus back to their families and the community.""  

ZDogg let the COO, Richard DeCarlo, off a little easy in my opinion:  

\*There were no questions on whether or not PPE was appropriate.  

\*Mr. DeCarlo's response that ""we didn't need a service tent outside"" supports Dr. Lin's assertion that they didn't have one.  If they truly felt that not having one ""was a better way to treat patients"", then responding to the community in kind would have been appropriate.  Mr. DeCarlo did not explain the rationale.  

\*Mr. DeCarlo admitted that PeaceHealth asked TeamHealth remove Dr. Lin from the schedule.  When asked if there was a policy for clinicians to not communicate to the press or social media, Mr. DeCarlo dodged it.  ""It's not that we have a policy that says don't ever talk to the media, what was at issue was the misinformation.""  

\*Mr. DeCarlo described the situation as one of ""going into a theater and yelling fire...\[patients felt\] it's not safe to go to that hospital, I could get Covid.""  Well, if there wasn't appropriate PPE and there wasn't any outside pretesting... yeah, I think you \*could\* get Covid.  

  

I just don't see the ""misinformation"" addressed.  They didn't have drive-through testing.  They didn't say they had appropriate PPE.  When asked about the department morale, Mr. DeCarlo mentioned that ""they were saddened by this whole episode because it has brought a lot of negative attention.""  I wasn't impressed - if I had a rogue clinician spout inaccuracies about my group I'd be disappointed \*because it wasn't true\*, not because of negative attention."

*“And this was always the deal: You came here because everyone was here. They aren’t all interesting or fabulous or famous or gritty, but a lot of them are, and they all chose to be here even though it would easier, simpler, roomier and cheaper to live someplace else. And without them, what is left? Just a bunch of big buildings and small apartments, the same city, but without its strivers—a place, at last, like anywhere else.

New York has withstood disasters before: 9/11, the financial crash, Hurricane Sandy, the Knicks. But those disasters were limited in geography and in scope. Huge swaths of New York and of its people were unaffected by them. Coronavirus will touch every corner of New York City life, and in time, every corner of American life. There will be nowhere to turn to for help, since what started here will soon spread out there.

To live in New York is to live on top of another, to constantly be jostling for space, whether it is lining up to fight the big building going up that would block out your light and air, or the armrest at a movie theater. It is hard to imagine a time when it will be safe to live like that again. And even if it were, what would be here to come home to?

That New York is dead now, too. By the end of this, the city’s sense of terminal uniqueness may have to come to an end. At some point New York will stop dealing with its horrific death toll and have to deal with its now staggering budget deficit, the fact that the businesses that snatched office space in downtown can now just have employees who work from home, the fact that many New Yorkers have fled elsewhere, and that there is much less of a city here to lure them back. It is a hole unlike any the city has ever had to dig itself out of.

I wish I could say that the New York we knew will return soon, that the people who post their phone numbers on telephone poles and invite their neighbors to call if they need food or medicine delivered or the peple who go to their balconies to cheer health care workers every day at 7 p.m. show the spirit and resiliency of the city, and that, like after 9/11, we will build back better than before, but I can’t right now. One day, perhaps, but now. It is impossible to look on New York and not despair.”* - David Freedlander"

On that same day, the Senate voted on the production of additional documents in the impeachment trial of President Trump.

Chinese authorities began publishing daily figures on 1 April on the number of new coronavirus cases that are asymptomatic, with the first day’s figures suggesting that around four in five coronavirus infections caused no illness. Many experts believe that unnoticed, asymptomatic cases of coronavirus infection could be an important source of contagion.

A total of 130 of 166 new infections (78%) identified in the 24 hours to the afternoon of Wednesday 1 April were asymptomatic, said China’s National Health Commission. And most of the 36 cases in which patients showed symptoms involved arrivals from overseas, down from 48 the previous day, the commission said.

China is rigorously testing arrivals from overseas for fear of importing a fresh outbreak of covid-19.

Tom Jefferson, an epidemiologist and honorary research fellow at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, said the findings were “very, very important.” He told The BMJ, “The sample is small, and more data will become available. Also, it’s not clear exactly how these cases were identified. But let’s just say they are generalisable. And even if they are 10% out, then this suggests the virus is everywhere. If—and I stress, if—the results are representative, then we have to ask, ‘What the hell are we locking down for?’”

Jefferson said that it was quite likely that the virus had been circulating for longer than generally believed and that large swathes of the population had already been exposed.

Users of Chinese social media have expressed fears that carriers with no symptoms could be spreading the virus unknowingly, especially now that infections have subsided and authorities have eased curbs on travel for people in previous hotspots in the epidemic.

Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, said that asymptomatic infections would not be able to cause another major outbreak of covid-19 if such people were kept in isolation. Officials have said this is usually for 14 days.

Nanshan said that once asymptomatic infected people were identified, they and their contacts would be isolated and kept under observation.

Citing classified data, the South China Morning Post said that China had already found more than 43 000 cases of asymptomatic infection through contact tracing.

The latest findings seem to contradict a World Health Organization report in February that was based on covid-19 in China. This suggested that “the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.”1

But since that WHO report other researchers, including Sergio Romagnani, a professor of clinical immunology at the University of Florence, have said they have evidence that most people infected by the virus do not show symptoms. Romagnani led the research that showed that blanket testing in a completely isolated village of roughly 3000 people in northern Italy saw the number of people with covid-19 symptoms fall by over 90% within 10 days by isolating people who were symptomatic and those who were asymptomatic.2

In an article on the website of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Jefferson and Carl Heneghan, director of the centre and editor of BMJ EBM, write, “There can be little doubt that covid-19 may be far more widely distributed than some may believe. Lockdown is going to bankrupt all of us and our descendants and is unlikely at this point to slow or halt viral circulation as the genie is out of the bottle.

“What the current situation boils down to is this: is economic meltdown a price worth paying to halt or delay what is already amongst us?”"

The article doesn’t say she had coronavirus.

Unfortunately at my hospital, for the last few weeks prior to the covids rolling in more recently, our census has been remarkably low both inpatient and even in the ED. People just aren’t coming in to the hospital. I’m sure there are fewer heart attacks when people aren’t exerting themselves at work, sure, but all the other medical conditions don’t just stop existing. I am grateful that telemedicine is amping up near me, but I am 100% sure that people that need care for other causes aren’t getting it because of fear of coming to the hospital, and that terrifies ME."

These are not inconsistent. The publicly reported data that we have available now is perfectly consistent with *both* a very high fatality rate *and* a gigantic mountain of unreported cases.

The mistake most people are making is comparing today's case number to today's death number. That doesn't work, because death occurs a median of 18 days after the first symptoms appear. So today's deaths reflect the number of symptomatic cases 18 days ago.

[When I did the math last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fp4bvd/-/fljhg7f), I found that in order for the case fatality rate to be *as low as* 3%, *at least* 96% of cases must have been undetected as recently as March 11. Repeating the same estimate with today's numbers, it looks like at least 88% were undetected as of March 22. And that's not even counting pre-symptomatic cases."

What I did, for people pay-walled out of the article, was: 

(1) explain that the 430,000 number should be viewed as 390,000 before February 2, and 40,000 after February 2; and

(2) clarify that while Trump deserves credit for imposing the February 2 travel restriction, he also deserves to be criticized for poorly addressing the  threat posed by the 40,000 Americans returning from China and all of those Americans/non-Americans who entered the US from infection hotspots in Europe, by failing to systematically screen/test/ quarantine/monitor these potential sources of infection in February and March.

> All you did was attempt to divert, distract and dilute

Unless you believe that Trump should have imposed much more comprehensive global travel restrictions in  early January, there's no way you could think I'm trying to exonerate Trump, could you?

By February, person-to-person transmission meant that this was no longer a ""Chinese virus"" but a global coronavirus. 

My comment was intended to clarify that it was catastrophically shortsighted for Trump to myopically look at the threat from the coronavirus as exclusively coming from non-Americans who had visited China.

OP, I think you have confused ""clarifying"" with ""correcting"" or ""criticizing"".

Huge swaths of New York and of its people were unaffected by them. Coronavirus will touch every corner of New York City life, and in time, every corner of American life. There will be nowhere to turn to for help, since what started here will soon spread out there.

To live in New York is to live on top of another, to constantly be jostling for space, whether it is lining up to fight the big building going up that would block out your light and air, or the armrest at a movie theater. It is hard to imagine a time when it will be safe to live like that again. And even if it were, what would be here to come home to?

By the end of this, the city’s sense of terminal uniqueness may have to come to an end. At some point New York will stop dealing with its horrific death toll and have to deal with its now staggering budget deficit, the fact that the businesses that snatched office space in downtown can now just have employees who work from home, the fact that many New Yorkers have fled elsewhere, and that there is much less of a city here to lure them back. It is a hole unlike any the city has ever had to dig itself out of.

I wish I could say that the New York we knew will return soon, that the people who post their phone numbers on telephone poles and invite their neighbors to call if they need food or medicine delivered or the peple who go to their balconies to cheer health care workers every day at 7 p.m. show the spirit and resiliency of the city, and that, like after 9/11, we will build back better than before, but I can’t right now.

In the study, the use of surgical masks by sufferers significantly reduced the number of flu viruses detectable in droplets released through breathing and coughing.
It also reduced the number of seasonal coronaviruses - among the causes of common colds - detectable in the air as suspended microdroplets, or aerosols. The study did not look at the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
“Further research is needed to determine whether masks can specifically prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2,” the scientists said.
The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, coincides with the pandemic of COVID-19 respiratory disease, which has infected more than a million people worldwide and killed more than 53,000.
Benjamin Cowling, the professor who led the study at the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for infectious disease epidemiology in Hong Kong, said its findings could be extrapolated to simpler cotton masks.
“My expert view is that cloth or cotton masks would have an effect, but maybe slightly less of an effect than a surgical mask properly worn,” he said in a telephone interview. “And in terms of COVID-19, we’re looking at every possible measure that could help.”
Until now, there has been little robust scientific evidence on the effectiveness of face masks in slowing transmission of respiratory diseases.
The WHO says masks should be worn by anyone with symptoms such as cough or fever, or anyone caring for a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case, but does not advise healthy people to wear them in everyday situations.
There is some evidence, however, to suggest that the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is due at least in part to the fact that it can be transmitted by people showing no symptoms.
upert Beale, a specialist in infection biology at London’s Francis Crick Institute who was not directly involved in Cowling’s work, said the study offered “strong and compelling evidence” for mask wearing as a means of reducing transmission of some viruses, but that they were not a magic bullet.
“Mask wearing does not completely prevent transmission and cannot be relied on as a sole measure,” he said, “but, combined with other social distancing measures, should form part of the ‘exit strategy’ from lockdown”."

The models show, there’s no El Nino to steer the hurricanes away like last year, there’s a 68% probability that FL or the Eastern Atlantic will get hit and it’s 2020, this year just sucks.  What could make it worse? A major disaster. 

Hurricane predictions are published the same time each year, we’re in South Florida, we have a dumb Governor and the stores are still sold out of everything.  I’m taking the warnings and trying to stock up from now, I bet the Trump supporters are going to be the first ones crying out for help.  They’ll be the first ones to say, no one warned us.

2020-04-05,inconclusivehush,AskReddit,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fveefp/is_coronnavirrus_a_hoax_why/fmhzpqf/,"Part of the reason we need to take such precautions (beside the death totals) is we know so little about COVID-19, or any coronavirus versus what we know about the influenza family of viruses.

1. We have never created a human vaccine for a Corona virus.
2. We have no treatment for this virus
3. Even people who have no/little symptoms have lasting affects from contracting this virus, people who get a severe case and are hospitalized own immune system can attack their brain, end up with lasting damage to their heart and lungs.
4. CDC answers an awful lot of ""We don't knows"" and ""There is no evidence"" about some areas. ie Do pets carry the virus, can animals infect humans? - there are limited reports of cats and dogs testing positive, and stories of some countries destroying animals
5. They STILL don't know if contracting the virus provides any immunity from catching it again and if it does how long that immunity might last. If it only provides a limited immunity, all those who contacted it the first time are now in the high risk group.
6. My state has about 10000 cases, we had 2000 new cases yesterday. In 2 or 3 weeks the death total is going to be huge. In over 1 month we had 8000 confirmed cases, in 1 weeks time we could triple that number. 
7. It is highly contagious
8. It is mutating. There are 8 confirmed strains of the virus, with many unconfirmed strains. The government/experts say they don't think that will affect developing a vaccine or that the virus will get deadlier.
9. The unknown produces uncertainty, which creates fear in the public and Wall Street.
10.  Some states and countries seem to be showing a different demographic in cases, seems some European countries and US states are reporting more cases of people between 20-50 than what was reported in
11. After about 3 weeks of H1N1 we had 4 deaths, with COVID -19 we had about 500, less than 3 weeks after that we have approximately 8500. Yesterday we had over 1000 deaths in the USA, which is over double the deaths in a day of the worst flu season, with the numbers increasing exponentially."
2020-04-05,HybridEng,politics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fvcvre/coronavirus_failures_show_trump_is_clear_and/fmhzq38/,What a bullshit article.  He's demonstrated this well before coronavirus appeared.
2020-04-05,macarthur_park,moderatepolitics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/fvdgcd/us_wasted_months_before_preparing_for_virus/fmhzuyw/,"> That's an interesting article but I wish it had taken a neutral stance.  There's no mention of the reports that China has and continues to downplay the impact and threat of the virus.  This article indicates the white house could have easily predicted what was going to happen but that assertion is flawed considering China's attempts at misinformation.

This is the AP, it generally doesn’t get much more neutral than that. China certainly tried to suppress information about the coronavirus early on, but by late January they were giving out enough information that it was clearly a serious issue. If nothing else, China’s lockdown of the entire Hubei province to stop the spread of the virus should have been a clear tip off. That was on Jan 23. 

Italy started seeing rapid growth of coronavirus cases in mid-to-late February, yet the federal government didn’t place its first orders for masks until mid March. Let’s give the administration the benefit of the doubt and say that despite widely available information, China’s obfuscation completely tricked them. By February there were cases all over the world in other countries which showed the scale and severity of the problem. Why did it take another month to act?

> The article also talked about trump being at odds with media reporting but the media has attacked trump since before he announced his run for president. Why would anyone think he would all of a sudden start trusting the very organization that has been against him for so long?

Trump was at odds with the media, scientists and medical experts, and with US intelligence reports. What else is new, right? This is exactly the problem. Again let’s give trump the benefit of the doubt. The media has been super-duper mean to him and he doesn’t trust them. He also doesn’t trust government scientists. He also doesn’t trust intelligence reports. Trumps reliance on his inner circle for information continues to be an inexcusable problem. 

> The last part is the idea that the federal government should have stepped in earlier rather than letting the states take the lead.  When was the last time the Fed stepped in and declared an emergency, enacted the defense act, prior to an emergency actually happening?  The idea there should have been more federal action makes sense in hindsight but the timeline the article uses implies immediate recognition of the viruses threat.


The emergency was the rapidly spreading virus. We knew it was highly contagious from early reports, and monitoring the spread in China, Italy, Europe, and even the US. When we had early, isolated cases one person would infect a cluster very quickly. This happened in the nursing home Washington and in New Rochelle in NY. 

I don’t know the history of federal government emergency declarations but state governments routinely declare an emergency when a hurricane is en route in order to free up funds and supplies for a proactive, immediate response. In this case, PPE prevents the spread of the virus, particularly among health care workers who are in short supply. It is asinine to wait for enough doctors to be out sick before we respond with PPE to protect the rest. 

> I absolutely think the administration could have done better and most of the poor choices stem from the advisors trump will listen to.  However, all factors have to be looked at and not skimmed over because people hate trump.

Thank you for ending with this because we’re in excellent agreement here (and I like to agree). I will say though I don’t think there were sufficient mitigating factors to remotely excuse the administration’s response or lack thereof."

But here’s some anecdotal evidence for you. In Northern Italy, 60 volunteers who thought they'd never suffered COVID-19 gave blood. 40 of them tested positive for antibodies to the virus.

Iceland lab's testing suggests 50% of coronavirus cases have no symptoms. 

There is an app you can download in the U.K. (and now the US) to report COVID-19 symptoms. Initial findings published this weekend show a predicted 1.9 million cases of symptomatic COVID-19 in the UK. If you account for asymptomatic cases, there is potentially significant underreporting.

The big thing to note is that not every state peaks at the same time. Its spread out based on social distancing and when the first cluster happens. That may be partially accounted for in the one you referenced, but the dashed line has a huge range of uncertainty for the peak since it averages the national case count. I don't like that particular model because it's important to recognize that you can't move a person in ICU from California to Texas effectively or safely. It's not that it's entirely wrong, its just not properly informative imo."

Here is the article




	Premier League football players have said demands to take steep pay cuts would result in £200m less in taxes to the NHS, as part of an intensifying row about how to spread the financial losses faced by the sport from suspension of fixtures during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Professional Footballers’ Union, the players’ trade body led by chief executive Gordon Taylor, has so far resisted calls by the Premier League for elite players to take 30 per cent reduction in wages. Last week, health secretary Matt Hancock also called top footballers to “take a cut and play their part”.

Following the latest round of crisis talks this weekend with the Premier League and the English Football League, which runs the three professional divisions below, the PFA released a statement.

“The proposed 30 per cent salary deduction over a 12-month period equates to over £500m in wage reductions and a loss in tax contributions of over £200m to the government,” it said. “What effect does this loss of earning to the government mean for the NHS? Was this considered in the Premier League proposal and did the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock factor this in when asking players to take a salary cut?”

On Saturday, league leaders Liverpool became the latest side to announce it will use the UK government’s furlough scheme to fund the wages of non-playing staff, without having first agreed cuts with their high-earning footballers.

The PFA has also been critical of moves by other Premier League clubs also owned by billionaires, such as Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United, for using the taxpayer-backed scheme.

Outside the PFA-led talks, players at teams such as Manchester United, the highest earning club in the country, are in active discussions over waiving a portion of their salaries or making donations to charitable causes, according to people familiar with the talks.

AnalysisThe Big Read
Can the sports industry survive the coronavirus shutdown?

Last week footballers at other leading European clubs agreed temporary wage reductions. Spain’s Barcelona agreed to cuts of 70 per cent, Germany’s Bayern Munich 20 per cent, while at Juventus in Italy, players have waived their salaries for four months. 

The PFA has said its members are “expecting to contribute financially to any solutions agreed upon” but wants to protect vulnerable players, particularly those in the lower leagues, where wages are substantially less, as well as those working on short-term contracts that are due to end in June. 

Executives at lower-league clubs have warned that without financial assistance and drastic cost-cutting measures, some are likely to go bust within weeks. The PFA has called for an agreement that would support these teams, adding: “Football needs to find a way to increase funding to the EFL and non-league clubs in the long-term.”"

Corona is very common and it's likely most of us have had it at some point in time.  Covid-19 is but a specific strain of Corona.  The problem is with Covid-19...not Corona in general.

At this point, isolation will not stop Covid-19.  According to health experts, 1 in 1000 Americans has confirmed cases.  This doesn't even count unconfirmed cases, which mean the real numbers are likely much higher.

Let's do some basic math and probability.  If 0.1% of Americans are infected, and a thousand or more visit a grocery store in day...isn't it safe to assume the grocery store is infected?  That most gas pump handles will be infected?  That most postal centers and mail will be infected?  I could go on...even with ""essential services"", it's extremely easy for this virus to spread. 

0.1% is a HUGE number.  At this point we need to stop pretending we can outrun the wave but rather we need to position ourselves not to capsize when the wave hits."

Christians are not being targeted. People who are breaking the Shelter ins are. Christians have GOT to learn how to meet without physically meeting. If any of these pastors instead said ""Hey idiots, because some of you are sick were moving to online videos for the next x weeks"" they would easily have fallen inline with ordinance. Online Church and active participation within your relationships is an easy way to alleviate this. It is my full belief that pandemic panic will blow over, having to wait a few weeks to go back out will not turn the U.S. into a China-Like police state. Things will be different, but it won't be the government's approach to handling Christianity.

The articles you posted are very weak, and add to the fear and hysteria without the substance to back it up. (I don't really care if other people are scared of this or not, but if they are it should be for good reason-these articles do not amount to that reason.)

*As The U.S. Economy Collapses... Unthinkable Might Happen*

For those who didnt read it... the ""unthinkable"" is we might have to wear PPE masks for a while. This article made no forecast for what a post Coronavirus America might do or look like.

*Alabama and Massachusetts ... Over to Police*

They are handing over the address to the police, they already have all of our information. If you are infected and are still going out you are a veritable threat to society. Wait two weeks and your doctor gives you the all clear. If the police can add up the information and prove youre knowingly potentially infecting people you should be punished for it. 

The two other articles are satisfied by my comments above.

*Have you thought about this?*

Yes, two months of low activity will not change the structure of Christianity in the United States.

*What things do you think we need to consider?*

Well, for at least the start healthy individuals that are in the lowest risk category should be asking high risk individuals if they need help with going out to hot zones. If they have already recovered fron c19 this is doubly so. (Provided you can't be reinfected, I don't know if this is true or not.)

What do we need to watch out for?

Looting. If this begins I'll start another post. (Either on how to do it effectively /s or how to stop others from doing it.) Otherwise corona is really just going to be tadgeting people who are bad stewards with their money. Oh well.

*How will technology and tracking affect our decisions and our ability to gather?*

Good question. If it becomes apparent this is happening, leaving phones at home.

*The time is rapidly approaching when we will not have the luxury of discussing or thinking about it. ""The prudent man sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it."" Proverbs 22:3*

It is within the realm of possibility, that herd immunity could be from 30%+ upwards... Kinda varies it seems https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity#Mechanics

Currently in lockdown, the most careless people in our society are doing the world a favour by meeting with other careless people. They may be spreading the virus onto some careful people when they come home etc, but generally, it will mean they will be the first to not be spreaders of the disease eventually.

That itself might have a weird effect on this whole immunity thing. The lockdown is pretty unprecedented.

As things go on and people crack, the next layer of people will become the carriers and get immunity. And then again, again.

Once things start getting lifted, people are still going to be semi cautious about things, and the less cautious will get it, blah, repeat of above.

I feel all this could potentially lead to herd immunity quicker than we typically see, because if careless types are the ones getting immunity first, then that should reduce the opportunities to have a person to jump to, right?

Yeah, I think a level of herd immunity is the only way out. They've never made a coronavirus vaccine, and a regular influenza vaccine is barely 50% effective, who knows how effective the one they make will be. If we have to wait until 2022, it's basically too late, and if we speed a vaccine through early, its likely to not be as effective as we need it to be.

Europe obviously is screwed the way it went so far with no caution initially. But I believe with caution, but still active spread, we can get to immunity... :\
_______

But Australia..... I don't know if we have enough active transmitters around to infect enough of the careless people! It was just so EARLY, we had to do it I know, we can't see what's going on and not lockdown, we're human, but...

If we collectively get so sick of the lockdown, and it doesn't even spread much in our country.... You know it's still out there even if its in small numbers.... the layers of careless people need to get infected, gradually, unfortunately, in my opinion, to lessen the impact, and to stop hospitals being overrun at once. Because I fear otherwise all the layers of careless people will get it at once, and it will blow up into something unmanageable and no one will have any immunity at all, which will rapidly spread it, in the heart of winter. 😮

Just my theory though."

It was all over reddit and international news. This was a big PR disaster for the Tablighi Jamaat people as they faced wrath of multiple south eastern countries who were affected by this. This single event spread the virus to dozens of countries. This is not a news anyone in that group can ""miss"" as it affected them so much. I am sure every single Tablighi Jamaat person who was in Delhi event knew about this.

Despite the outbreak, Tablighi Jammat organised a second international mass gathering on 18 March in Gowa Regency near Makassar in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Though the organisers initially rebuffed official directives to cancel the gathering, they subsequently complied and cancelled the gathering.

Nizamuddin faction of the Tablighi Jamaat held a religious congregational program in Nizamuddin West, Delhi from 13 to 15 March 2020 before pan-India lockdown was announced which was attended by several foreign speakers and over 500 members. It is suspected that some of these speakers were infected by the Coronavirus which later spread to the congregants.

In Pakistan, 36 Tableeghi Jamaat members tested positive in Hyderabad, Pakistan on 30 March. 1000s more are suspected and common people in Pakistan are ostracizing people of Tableeghi Jamaat due to fear of coronavirus.

These are the known places. It is very possible that they have infected in Bangladesh and several other countries like Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

The thing is that even after knowing they were infected and caused such a massive problem in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonasia, two weeks later, they did a similar event in Delhi. Another bad thing is that even after knowing about this outbreak in Malaysia originating from this group, India failed to stop them from doing an event in India.

It is within the realm of possibility, that herd immunity could be from 30%+ upwards... Kinda varies it seems https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity#Mechanics

Currently in lockdown, the most careless people in our society are doing the world a favour by meeting with other careless people. They may be spreading the virus onto some careful people when they come home etc, but generally, it will mean they will be the first to not be spreaders of the disease eventually.

That itself might have a weird effect on this whole immunity thing. The lockdown is pretty unprecedented.

As things go on and people crack, the next layer of people will become the carriers and get immunity. And then again, again.

Once things start getting lifted, people are still going to be semi cautious about things, and the less cautious will get it, blah, repeat of above.

I feel all this could potentially lead to herd immunity quicker than we typically see, because if careless types are the ones getting immunity first, then that should reduce the opportunities to have a person to jump to, right?

Yeah, I think a level of herd immunity is the only way out. They've never made a coronavirus vaccine, and a regular influenza vaccine is barely 50% effective, who knows how effective the one they make will be.

Europe obviously is screwed the way it went so far with no caution initially. But I believe with caution, but still active spread, we can get to immunity... :\
_______

But Australia..... I don't know if we have enough active transmitters around to infect enough of the careless people! It was just so EARLY, we had to do it I know, we can't see what's going on and not lockdown, we're human, but...

If we collectively get so sick of the lockdown, and it doesn't even spread much in our country.... You know it's still out there even if its in small numbers.... the layers of careless people need to get infected, gradually, unfortunately, in my opinion, to lessen the impact, and to stop hospitals being overrun at once. Because I fear otherwise all the layers of careless people will get it at once, and it will blow up into something unmanageable and no one will have any immunity at all, which will rapidly spread it, in the heart of winter. 😮

Just my theory though."

Why are you concerned about making him feel bad? Clearly he’s a player who gets around since you’ve heard stories. I’m sure he’ll be okay if you decide to be a reasonable person and put your foot down about this and tell him no.

Also, when is this supposed to happen? Genuine question, why aren’t you practicing social distancing? You shouldn’t be going out and socializing and having sex right now. Depending on where you live that may even be illegal. You don’t want coronavirus and you don’t want to get pregnant.

> So what’s life like for the other 10%? Are some Americans still chatting at the local barbershop, meeting for post-work happy hours and gathering for backyard barbecues?

> Not so much. The reality is a complicated and even conflicted mix of respect for a deadly pathogen, concern over its economic implications, and a desire to maintain a sense of American independence in the face of a collective tragedy.

„The only means to fight the plague is honesty.“ Albert Camus, The Plague (1947)

According to the latest data of the Italian National Health Institute ISS, the average age of the positively-tested deceased in Italy is currently about 81 years. 10% of the deceased are over 90 years old. 90% of the deceased are over 70 years old.

80% of the deceased had suffered from two or more chronic diseases. 50% of the deceased had suffered from three or more chronic diseases. The chronic diseases include in particular cardiovascular problems, diabetes, respiratory problems and cancer.

Less than 1% of the deceased were healthy persons, i.e. persons without pre-existing chronic diseases. Only about 30% of the deceased are women.

The Italian Institute of Health moreover distinguishes between those who died from the coronavirus and those who died with the coronavirus. In many cases it is not yet clear whether the persons died from the virus or from their pre-existing chronic diseases or from a combination of both.

The two Italians deceased under 40 years of age (both 39 years old) were a cancer patient and a diabetes patient with additional complications. In these cases, too, the exact cause of death was not yet clear (i.e. if from the virus or from their pre-existing diseases).

The partial overloading of the hospitals is due to the general rush of patients and the increased number of patients requiring special or intensive care. In particular, the aim is to stabilize respiratory function and, in severe cases, to provide anti-viral therapies.

(Update: The Italian National Institute of Health published a statistical report on test-positive patients and deceased, confirming the above data.)

Here are some things you could look at to troubleshoot:

1. mouse/mousemat: does it track predictably and precisely? Is the mouse comfortable in your hand? -- Go to a store with display models or a gaming cafe sometime (after coronavirus, welp) and figure out whether your setup at home is good. Easiest basic check is to test other setups.

2. posture/desk/seat. Are you in a good position where your arm can move freely/you can brace your wrist comfortable, where you're not getting fatigue or cramps or pain. -If so then it doesn't need to be perfect, but if not then it's really important.

3. input lag and frame rate. - Look up your monitor model ([here](https://displaylag.com/display-database/) for example, ) and see how much input lag it has. -- And some graphics settings (not just Vsync) apparently tend to or always introduce input lag, I couldn't tell you which but there's a guide out there somewhere.

4. health. As cool and matrixesque as online gaming is, you still aim with your wrist/hand/arm, so it's still a physical task of the mere flesh, and so it still helps to be in good shape. - Now obviously no one can just snap their fingers and be in better health, but it's a factor, and if you're in it for the long haul then it's a factor to work on and a confines within which you have to work.

5. focused practice. You may have already dedicated some time to this, I don't know, but it's worth noting that 4200 hours of CS may not- by raw amount of time spent shooting moving targets, be very much practice at all, especially if you feel you were relying on other things than your aim. So if you haven't already then go play some quake deathmatch or tf2 ammomod or Osu or aim trainer(s) or overwatch custom modes and FFA.

TL:DR: If after 4200 hours you feel like it's still bad, I'm guessing you either just have admirably high standards, or one of the above things is missing."

The CDC [specifically advises HCPs to conserve respirators and surgical masks by reusing them until they become visibly soiled](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html). They do not become visibly soiled after 20-30 minutes of normal wear. I've been reusing the same surgical mask at my hospital for the past month, storing it in a paper bag between shifts.

Those posters I saw were just a few days ago and had really angered me with the false recommendations and the threatening of law enforcement (technically per those posters I myself would not be able to go to work and would have to stay home effective immediately and that could be enforced - which is just insane.)

Unfortunately at my hospital, for the last few weeks prior to the covids rolling in more recently, our census has been remarkably low both inpatient and even in the ED. People just aren’t coming in to the hospital. I’m sure there are fewer heart attacks when people aren’t exerting themselves at work, sure, but all the other medical conditions don’t just stop existing. I am grateful that telemedicine is amping up near me, but I am 100% sure that people that need care for other causes aren’t getting it because of fear of coming to the hospital."

The article would be better served as a statement from Neuel himself as no one else is quoted or sourced.  In addition, outside of the West, Neuel isn't treated as credible because of his pro-Israeli and anti-Palestinian stances.  Neuel, himself, has a tendency to be hypocritical when it comes to his defense of Israel while castigating other countries for human rights lapses and decrying of all anti-Israeli sentiments as anti-Semitism or racism.  These tendencies become especially relevant because of UNHRC's constant focus on Israeli treatment of Palestinians (UNHRC has passed more resolutions condemning Israel than the rest of the world combined).

In a perfect world, those who perpetrate human rights abuses are immediately prosecuted and punished.  But unfortunately, the UN and the world are far from perfect.

Besides all this, trying to politicize and play the blame game in the response to the current coronavirus situation is ridiculous.  Is China at fault?  Yes.  Does China deserve blame for failing their initial response?  Yes.  But the response has also been botched in the West as well even with plenty of warning signs from China."

It was all over reddit and international news. This was a big PR disaster for the Tablighi Jamaat people as they faced wrath of multiple south eastern countries who were affected by this. This single event spread the virus to dozens of countries. This is not a news anyone in that group can ""miss"" as it affected them so much. I am sure every single Tablighi Jamaat person who was in Delhi event knew about this.

Despite the outbreak, Tablighi Jammat organised a second international mass gathering on 18 March in Gowa Regency near Makassar in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Though the organisers initially rebuffed official directives to cancel the gathering, they subsequently complied and cancelled the gathering.

Nizamuddin faction of the Tablighi Jamaat held a religious congregational program in Nizamuddin West, Delhi from 13 to 15 March 2020 before pan-India lockdown was announced which was attended by several foreign speakers and over 500 members. It is suspected that some of these speakers were infected by the Coronavirus which later spread to the congregants.

In Pakistan, 36 Tableeghi Jamaat members tested positive in Hyderabad, Pakistan on 30 March. 1000s more are suspected and common people in Pakistan are ostracizing people of Tableeghi Jamaat due to fear of coronavirus.

These are the known places. It is very possible that they have infected in Bangladesh and several other countries like Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

The thing is that even after knowing they were infected and caused such a massive problem in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonasia, two weeks later, they did a similar event in Delhi. Another bad thing is that even after knowing about this outbreak in Malaysia originating from this group, India failed to stop them from doing an event in India.

1) we were not told this was an issue and the administration was downplaying it during Mardi Gras. We had no known cases at the time Mardi Gras started. 

2) for anyone about to contest point 1: Mardi Gras is not one day. Mardi Gras lasts for 6-8 weeks, sometimes longer depending on where Easter/Ash Wednesday falls. But if we want to go with Mardi Gras day, WHO had not yet classified it as a pandemic on 2/25. (Specifically CNN reported: World Health Organization officials say it's still too early to declare the novel coronavirus a pandemic). 

3) the entire world could have been affected by nuclear holocaust and New Orleans would not have been aware of one bit of it from 2/19 until 2/26. The Wednesday before Mardi Gras day is the point of no return and everyone’s life here consists of Mardi Gras until Ash Wednesday.

Infusing the mindset of slaves and destroying liberty is a reach. You're being told not to leave the house to do nonessential activities for the time being, its insulting to compare that to slavery and people who actually live in a country where their rights are truly limited. 
What I hear from this is: ""The vulnerable that may be infected and may be killed be damned, so long as I can keep my right of going wherever the fuck I please whenever.""
It's not about you, it's about the people you're directly affecting. If someone runs around brandishing a knife outside, they'd also be stopped. 
If you're really that worried, people who understand this will not be 'infused with the mind of slaves', trust me. 

The economy on the other hand won't avoid suffering, as it does in pandemics. It revolves around the people, and ironically, the more people are infected the more it'll suffer in the long run. 
I won't claim that this quarantine isn't an added problem to the lack of freedom in some countries.
But for the majority, this is done as an absolute necessity and is not an attack on people's rights."

I will add that the simulation (red, blue, green, yellow) should have a gigantic asterisk next to it. Modeling fluid flow in an actual enclosed space with people moving around, HVAC, breathing, doors opening, etc. while accounting for all of the complexities like turbulence and thermodynamics is very computationally challenging. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was actually impossible at the moment. This simulation is going to be a very ideal case - a closed system and nothing happening outside of the cough.

So no doubt the droplets can hang around for a while, as lab testing showed. However, if someone coughs in a room you’re almost certainly not going to have a micro droplet cloud polluting the room for hours as the simulation implies. It’s a good idea to wear a mask to protect yourself against stray droplets but also realize that when you walk into Harris Teeter you’re not walking into a pervasive cloud of coronavirus."

Work back from deaths. 15,000 is 1.3% of the entire population. Assuming 100% of the population got infected, that would need an IFR 5 to 10 times the best estimates to result. 

Make sure you understand the difference between IFR and CFR. The [best estimate for CFR](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3556644) right now is about 2.8%:

>We find that the naı̈ve estimator of CFR is asymptotically biased for the true CFR. To compensate for both of these variables we apply an expectation maximization strategy previously developed for emerging pathogens such as pandemic influenza. We obtain a CFR estimate of 2.8% for COVID-19. We also show that all estimators for the relative CFR are unstable with current data. Finally, we release our code on GitHub so it can be used as more data becomes available globally.

The CFR is the number of confirmed cases that are estimated to be likely to die. It is a vast overestimate of the number of *infected people* who are likely to die, because none of the countries where the information was obtained from tested and caught every single person who was infected. Asymptomatic individuals, multiple individuals in the same family after 1 tests positive, minor cases, people who just stay home and get sick and don't seek help, they don't get tested so they don't count in calculating the CFR.

The [best estimates](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/) for the infected fatality ratio (IFR) is between 5 and 10 times less than the CFR. That would be between 0.27% and 0.56%

Even if 100% of the Saskatchewan population were expected to be infected, an IFR of even 0.56% would still be less than 6,500.

Secondly, in order to justify our present course of action, we need to figure out how many people we are expecting to actually save.

If we keep the present lockdowns going for the [next 18 to 24 months,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready) we can wait it out and eventually have a vaccine. How much does this reduce the total number of infected people? I'm not sure because no one has provided the relative reduction of R0 for the actions we are taking. Let's assume we reduce the total infections by 90% (look, I'm telling you my assumption, the government is not). Great! We saved 5,900 lives! But we also spent 5 to 6 times more than we are currently estimating, because the current stimulus package and economic harm estimates assume ending the lockdown after 3 months. The stimulus package runs out in June. The harm to the economy has us lose 20% of our GDP in the next 3 months. Not 20% annualized for the quarter. Just chop off 20% of our GDP in a single quarter. That's unprecedented and it will probably take us 100 years to fully recover from that. Multiply the costs for 18 months and we are all living in the dark ages or Mad Max. Congratulations. You saved 6,500 people by ending western civilization. 

Assume we keep this up for 3 months then return to normal. We get a big second wave that does as much or more damage as the first wave would have. All 6,500 people would still die. Congratulations. You spent $100B in federal spending and lost $200B from the national economy (our share of that all would be approximately $9B) and saved no one. \*sad trombone noise*

So where is the balance between the number of lives we are going to **SAVE** and the economic suicide we are committing?"

>Our paper yields two main insights. First, we find that areas that were more severely affected by the 1918 Flu Pandemic saw a sharp and persistent decline in real economic activity. Second, we find that cities that implemented early and extensive NPIs suffered no adverse economic effects over the medium term. On the contrary, cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively experienced a relative increase in real economic activity after the pandemic subsided. Altogether, our findings suggest that pandemics can have substantial economic costs, and NPIs can lead to both better economic outcomes and lower mortality rates.

...

>With respect to the economic effects of the pandemic, we find that more severely affected areas experienced a relative decline in manufacturing employment, manufacturing output, bank assets, and durable goods consumption. Our regression estimates imply that the **1918 Flu Pandemic led to an 18 percent reduction in manufacturing output** for a state at the mean level of exposure. Exposed areas also saw a rise in bank charge-offs, reflecting an increase in business and household defaults. These patterns are consistent with the notion that pandemics depress economic activity through reductions in both supply and demand (Eichenbaum et al. 2020). Importantly, the declines in all outcomes were persistent, and more affected areas remained depressed relative to less exposed areas from 1919 through 1923.

...

>Comparing cities by the speed and aggressiveness of NPIs, we find that early and forceful NPIs did not worsen the economic downturn. On the contrary, cities that intervened earlier and more aggressively experienced a relative increase in manufacturing employment, manufacturing output, and bank assets in 1919, after the end of the pandemic.

...

>For example, economist Danny Quah notes that Singapore's management of COVID-19 has avoided major disruptions to economic activity without leading to a sharp increase in infections through the use of forceful, early interventions. Therefore, well-calibrated, early, and forceful NPIs should not be seen as having major economic costs in a pandemic.

Here's a projection of deaths per day, per 100,000 if coronavirus is let loose:

Applied to Alberta, at it's peak we could expect 700-750 people dead, *per day*.

Here's a graph of ICU beds needed:

https://images.app.goo.gl/LzqAq5kW2VmGDjq79

The red line at the bottom is the UK's capacity.

Applied to Alberta, it's over 11,000 beds occupied at once. 

.

The fatality rate of all infected is about 0.66%:

>Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33)

.

The disease isn't so much the problem as the shock of a bunch of bad things happening all at once. If the hospitals are overwhelmed, then people with ""ordinary"" emergencies are at greater risk of death or disability. Add up all the people who will die because they can't get a ventilator, and all the people who will die because the hospitals are overflowing with COVID patients, and we could easily see 1-2% of our population die this year if we just let the pandemic run it's course.

On the economic side, it's ridiculous to think that we can wipe out a solid 1-2% of our population over the course of several weeks without causing a major shock to our economy. Those people represent a sizable portion of the demand side of our economy, and without them there's less money flowing around. That's a recession. We might be able to absorb that loss, but not in such a short time span. There's likely a number of unintended consequences from doing this that can't be predicted as well. Lucky for us, we get to watch the United States bum-rush the 1 million dead mark and learn what that means.

We simply don't have the capacity for this pandemic to run wild. We will be storing bodies on our hockey rinks, and using school gyms to house sick people on army cots. We don't have the people to staff this scenario. People will die who don't have to, by the thousands. 

Here's my takeaway from the whole situation we're in. There is no perfect solution that saves lives and the economy. We are faced with the choice between a bad economic downturn of our own making, or a catastrophic downturn resulting from an uncontained pandemic. Taking a temporary hit to save our healthcare system will let us retain our economic productivity for the future."

Two descriptions of the virus published on Nature this week indicated that the genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis ^1,2. It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it passed onto human.

>An article published on The Lancet reported that 41 people in Wuhan were found to have the acute respiratory syndrome and 27 of them had contact with Huanan Seafood Market ^3. The 2019-nCoV was found in 33 out of 585 samples collected in the market after the outbreak. The market was suspicious to be the origin of the epidemic, and was shut down according to the rule of quarantine the source during an epidemic.

>The bats carrying CoV ZC45 were originally found in Yunnan or Zhejiang province, both of which were more than 900 kilometers away from the seafood market. Bats were normally found to live in caves and trees. But the seafood market is in a densely-populated district of Wuhan, a metropolitan of ~15 million people. The probability was very low for the bats to fly to the market. According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents
and 28 visitors, the bat was never a food source in the city, and no bat was traded in the market. There was possible natural recombination or intermediate host of the coronavirus, yet little proof has been reported.

>Was there any other possible pathway? We screened the area around the seafood
market and identified two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus. Within ~280 meters from the market, there was the Wuhan Center for Disease Control & Prevention (WHCDC) (Figure 1, from Baidu and Google maps). WHCDC hosted animals in laboratories for research purpose, one of which was specialized in pathogens collection and identification ^4-6. In one of their studies, 155 bats including Rhinolophus affinis were captured in Hubei
province, and other 450 bats were captured in Zhejiang province 4. The expert in collection was noted in the Author Contributions (JHT). Moreover, he was broadcasted for collecting viruses on nation-wide newspapers and websites in 2017 and 2019 7,8. He described that he was once by attacked by bats and the blood of a bat shot on his skin. He knew the extreme danger of the infection so he quarantined himself for 14 days ^7. In another accident, he quarantined himself again because bats peed on him. He was once thrilled for capturing
a bat carrying a live tick ^8.

>Surgery was performed on the caged animals and the tissue samples were collected for DNA and RNA extraction and sequencing 4, 5. The tissue samples and contaminated trashes were source of pathogens. They were only ~280 meters from the seafood market. The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital (Figure 1, bottom) where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic. It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs
are needed in future study.

>The second laboratory was ~12 kilometers from the seafood market and belonged to Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ^1,9,10. This laboratory reported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused the 2002-3 pandemic ^9. The principle investigator participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human emergence ^10. A direct speculation was that SARS-CoV or its derivative might leak from the laboratory.

>In summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of 2019-nCoV coronavirus. In addition to origins of natural recombination and intermediate host, *the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.* Safety level may need to be reinforced in high risk biohazardous laboratories. Regulations may be taken to relocate these laboratories far away from city center and other densely populated places.

I spent the previous 10 years thinking I had ME/CFS, and to me having an EDS diagnosis was an incredible relief because I finally had a physical explanation for all of my problems.

But I feel the same deprivation you do. This illness has taken my life away, and it made it hard to do the most basic things in the world. A lot of the time, I'm focused just on getting through the day, surviving to the next day. So, I'm not thinking about how much I resent this illness. But I certainly do.

But this will almost certainly get better given time. Medical technology is developing at an amazing pace, and right now we are going into a period where medical spending will be accelerating more, and more people will be trying novel drugs, some of which may cure things that they didn't expect to be cured of.

For instance, the first patient who was cured of HIV only got that because he was diagnosed with leukaemia, and treated for it. The leukaemia treatment (admittedly quite an extreme one I believe) cured his HIV.

Who knows, someone with EDS may well try some novel coronavirus therapy (I'm looking at monoclonal antibodies, probably) and find that their EDS symptoms significantly recede, and then they'll find that the drug works in a large proportion of other EDS patients.

And that's far from the only avenue of medical development. Survive long enough and we'll all probably have some kind of cure. Heck, in 50 years we'll probably be able to do mind uploads into a robotic body. I know if I can survive 50 years and raise the money for it, I'll be able to get a new body."

Maybe people embracing the idea of an apocalypse are not envisioning a Hobbesian state of nature but the total opposite. Maybe chaos is needed for change and so we're enthralled by the chaos because it's a beacon that we're in a place in time that we're able to dramatically shift the narrative  we've been stuck in. Subjugated by corporate greed, pollution, politicians that aren't servants but just set on exchanging money and power and covering things up.

There's a chance at change for the entire planet. Unfortunately, us humans waste in comfort and it takes something devastating to act as an impetus for action. Kant said, ""If the truth will kill them, let them die"" Apocalyptic scenarios and what we're facing with coronavirus creates an environment to let all the weak links break. This is an opportunity for growth we haven't had because the show's been going on according to plan.

The fact that the adults in the room have been able to push Trump out of the way to get their voices out despite Trump trying to stand in front of them long enough to hobble together a response does not speak glowingly of Trump's response.  We've been reasonably successful in spite of Trump, not because of him.

At the same token, attention is a limited resource.  Trump sells papers, but I don't know that criticisms of Trump are good for our psyche, and some of the criticisms have been.... irrelevant.  There were a few articles posted that said that ""if Trump owns the stock market rise he owns the stock market fall"" which is a cheap pot shot that is always taken at presidents despite the general consensus that . a president can't control the economy and given what we're seeing around the world, Coronavirus was going to have a pretty big impact despite Trump's response, but it does feel like most of the actions Trump is directly responsible for (not necessarily his administration) have made things worse, like [telling his staff not to work with Governor's who criticize his administration](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/trump-says-white-house-shouldnt-work-with-governor/).  I can't think of another president in recent history who wouldn't have used this moment to try and unify the country.

This isn't to say a president has to be particularly knowledgable about the details of how to fight a pandemic.  I don't blame Trump for not knowing how to fight a pandemic.  I blame him for trying -- and trying in bad faith.   A leader should speak words of support to the country and get out of the way for the experts to handle things.

But despite all this I kinda think we just need to shut Trump out.  Someone should hold him accountable but I don't think it's not useful to continuously reiterate the incompetence of our president, especially in a time when we're uncertain enough about everything."

But, it's a great book to read at some point your young life. 

Basically the key takeaway for me personally was to be shameless in being passionate about things and to find your confidence in being productive. The world is full of people who just *talk* and live off the backs of those who *act*. You want to be someone who acts, not just an empty shell of a person that just talks, and your potential is then limitless. That's basically what you can condense the whole book down to in a few words. Even though it was written over fifty years ago, it feels so in-the-present based on our current political climate and *extra* especially now during this coronavirus hysteria. There's a lot of hate toward the book, but the book itself is not as polarizing as people who never actually read it make it out to be."

Might be a while before I do another big post. But just to kind of give an update:

*Hit day 100 mid February. Enjoyed 3 weeks of being back at work, going out to eat and going to grocery stores but then this coronavirus thing hit.

*Stopped Brentuximab due to neuropathy. I technically didn't fall into the high risk category anyways but for a couple reasons (mostly relapsing after early stage disease) my onc thought it would be worth doing and got approved. Made it two doses in before neuropathy in my fingers and face became a pretty significant issue and we decided to stop/pause. Neuropathy has pretty much unchanged since last treatment (hasn't gone away but hasn't gotten worse). That decision was made a week or two before coronavirus became a thing but it did cause my counts to drop too so maybe would have stopped anyways. When I got labs drawn a week ago my counts were all normal except my hemoglobin which was like 13.5 and has been steadily creeping back towards normal.


*Strength/endurance is slowly improving too. Exercising most days and now able to run up to 4 miles at a time. 

*Appetite and taste have been normal for a while now, but not sure if I specified that in any posts.

Otherwise I have mostly just traded anxiety about my diagnosis for anxiety about COVID. I'm relatively young and outside of cancer completely healthy so I'm hoping that even if I got it I'd be fine, but on a BMTinfonet video an oncologist from Harvard said any AutoSCT patients within 6 months of transplant are high risk (I'm right around 5)

I'm in a sticky situation with my employers and it's very frustrating.
I work for an independent catering company as a senior manager who pre-coronavirus ran 2 kitchens in 2 different cities. When the initial outbreak became serious before they closed restaurants we decided to close and begin looking at opening a series of take-aways in those cities. Then the lock down became serious and my directors began insisting that no more than 2 people ever be in any of our offices or kitchens at any one time. 

Then i got told my pay would be changed to furlough and for the most part we needed to self isolate, so i began self isolating. Then my partner got a letter from the NHS saying that they had to quarantine because they were at sever risk due to medical issues they have. 

Over the last week my directors have started to get very angry with me for not basically single-handedly setting up these businesses and are insisting on making me travel between cities to set up and recruit people for these takeaways. I explained to them that it wasn't wise for me to travel between cities as my partner is high risk, and since they are refusing to leave their houses at all, it's a bit unacceptable to expect me to do everything, especially since i'm being payed via furlough. 


I got a response saying they agree that i shouldn't have to travel between cities, then the following day i got a phone call saying i had to travel 140 miles to buy kitchen equipment, recruit a full kitchen team and train them to run these businesses. whilst training up a full team of staff in my current city, whilst not having more than 2 people in the building at any one time. Then i got a message from my other director that i was basically going to have to run both businesses simultaneously to cut down on other people coming into contact with one another. i'm relying on a few people that they're organising to do construction work for me and delivering storage containers and fridges and they haven't organised it for me because they want to reduce how much human contact they have to have. but i cannot actually get to these people because i don't drive. 


So far i designed menus, got suppliers, got everything set up. then i got radio silence from them for 2 days, followed by a dead line for less than a week to get these takeaways set up, and was told to completely change the menu, and recruit our own drivers, and train up a team to be able to run the business in a week so i can be available to basically move to another city for a week.

Whenever i try to reach out and talk to them, i either get snotty whatsapp messages, a promise of a conference call that never happens, or just silence followed by them just giving me a list of ridiculous tasks whilst they're sat at home. and i don't know what i should do or if i were to refuse to commute between cities it would put my job on the line. i don't drive so i would be obliged to take public transport, whereas all my directors drive but aren't willing to travel.



TL;DR:

Being made to travel between cities and set up food outlets whilst being forced to work solo due to self-isolation.

Bosses are ignoring my requests to self isolate due to my partner's medical situation. 

Being payed the government's furlough in lieu of my actual pay, but being made to work full time hours.

being given dead lines for setting up food outlets without any sensible resources and rather than discussing it with me, they just send me snotty messages and lists of bizarre tasks when i try to get in touch with the issues i'm facing."

This pandemic has compromised our economy completely - a double whammy of depriving us of new revenue from everyone being out of work and having to pay benefits to those affected by the pandemic.

I was planning on launching and selling the device this month, but because of the coronavirus and economic uncertainty, I decided to put it on hold.  

I was looking a the app and I can put down over $10K in costs for the 12 months prior to Jan 31, but for my revenue part, it will be $0.  

Since my revenue part is $0, what are my chances of getting this grant because right now I really need it to keep this business afloat since I spent so much developing it.  Or does anyone have any advice or suggestion on what I should do?   

Thanks so much in advance for the help!"

Can you cite any actual sources for what you are suggesting? Or is this your own ""personal hunch"" on a situation you only understand from reading news articles? The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease is calling for a nationwide shelter-in-place order for a reason.
> For those that don't understand how contagious this virus is and that it can be dormant in people for quite a while before they show symptoms, they would think that the virus would be wiped out. But that's not what would happen. It would just spread once the lockdown was lifted.

So what are you suggesting here? We don't lock down at all? We need to let some people build immunity naturally before we lock down? It appears you are conflating the idea of herd immunity through vaccination (which the term is typically associated with) with an idea of herd immunity achieved through ""natural means."" Typically, the concept of herd immunity refers to the vaccination of a large percentage of the population, so that the virus is unable to propagate and be transmitted to individuals with compromised immune systems that otherwise cannot be vaccinated. [Here is a video explaining this concept.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuiHFg_nfnE) In the situation where a novel virus appears to which we have no vaccine (coronavirus), most or all individuals of the population are susceptible. Herd immunity is achieved by either (1) letting the virus run rampant through the community, infecting and killing large swaths of people--what I described as the ""natural means"" above or (2) implementing measures to contain everyone (specifically infected individuals). In the case of (2), the disease is allowed to run its course in individuals who are already infected--ie, allow those people to build immunity--and reach a point where they have a viral burden in their system that is effectively non-transmissible. All while not exposing uninfected individuals and allowing the disease to be transmitted. In the case of (2), you use the time during lockdown to develop a vaccine and ultimately achieve herd immunity at a later time point.
> If you lock down a town before they have any immunity, then when everybody else releases the lockdown, that town with no immunity will get destroyed.

You are suggesting some imaginary option (3), wherein you don't lockdown immediately, allow infected individuals to develop immunity, but somehow don't transmit the disease? That is impossible and completely asinine.

> Perhaps you know it isn't true and you're being dishonest, or perhaps you just don't know, either way your advice would cause more people to die because you don't understand herd immunity and epidemiology. Lockdowns have to take place based on local conditions, not global conditions.

Perhaps you should actually gain an understanding of herd immunity and epidemiology before you start criticizing. Stop talking out your ass and peddling a narrative where lockdowns should be implemented on a reactive basis rather a proactive basis."

2020-04-05,caboclo_capiroba,China,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/fp716s/where_is_huang_yanling/fmi4tha/,"At first glance, that first article is interesting. But really its very spectulative, unreliable and misleading. It quotes sources back from 2013 to say that bats and rodents have been captured for research purposes. This explains nothing.

The statement that a doctor contamined himself with bat blood is supported by a 2017 paper. The virus wouldnt take 3 years to spread, and if it took, it would be transmiting itself and mutating through the years to a multitude of different people. It probably wouldnt even be traceable back to Wuhan.

It has little evidence to support its hypothesis, so it quotes articles about hantabiruses and bacteria to back up its claims. The only quotations about coronavirus researches themselves say well known facts in the scientific comunity. Yes, it was already known that an epidemic of coronavirus could take place someday.

Moreover, the article number 9 in the references analyses the ACE2 receptor. Ironically, an analysis of the same receptor is one of the reasons that support the view according to which the onset of the virus in a laboratory is unlikely (see article below).

> According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors, the bat was never a food source in the city, and no bat was traded in the market. There was possible natural recombination or intermediate host of the coronavirus, yet little proof has been reported.

It doesnt quote any sources to the ""no bat in market"" statement, but its false that little proof has been reported about natural recombination. Actually a recent well done genetic study has shown it is likely that the virus sprung from recombination among animal and/or human hosts. This study also takes in consideration the laboratory hypothesis and explains that it is unlikely that the virus began in a laboratory: 

""Although the evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here. However, since we observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features, including the optimized RBD and polybasic cleavage site, in related coronaviruses in nature, we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible."""

CNN claims that the White House was ""distracted"" by the impeachment trial. I'm sure it was.

But CNN was also covering the impeachment trial 24/7. And when the impeachment trial was over they started covering the Democratic nomination 24/7.

Most people don't read newspapers anymore. They get their news from TV and the internet. And there are people in red states who continue to call the coronavirus a ""hoax"".

There is a lot of blame to go around. CNN didn't start paying attention until cases started appearing in the US. When somebody died in Washington State Trump said ""Look he was an old man with preexisting conditions. He was already sick.""

“China’s numbers are fake,” the report concludes.

“There’s no indication that the data that came out of China in terms of their infection rate and their death rate was falsified in any way,” [Hajdu said](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://twitter.com/TrueNorthCentre/status/1245767301099655169__;!!MtWvt2UVEQ!SvBFkdao5SFC_jZwcXRld8OI5e-q_3apJxHKT4lTf1s-roYLAdZq33h80dSUukJK%24) sternly.

And trying to do this from home because of stay at home orders. So they are slammed. All in the course of a couple of weeks. 

He said it’s the most volatile he’s ever seen. Rates fluctuating from 2.5% to 3.5% within a couple of days. Multiple rate repricings a day. The day I called he said rates were 3.0% on a 15 year loan. I told him what rate I’m looking for (or under) and he took all my info and pulled my credit so I was ready to go. I told him “if it’s 2.75% or under on a 15 year refi, lock for me ASAP.” He texted me a couple days later that he locked me at 2.625%. Now going through the full underwriting. Good man."

United States involvement in regime change has entailed both overt and covert actions aimed at altering, replacing, or preserving foreign governments. In the latter half of the 19th century, the U.S. government initiated actions for regime change mainly in Latin America and the southwest Pacific, including the Spanish–American and Philippine–American wars. At the onset of the 20th century the United States shaped or installed friendly governments in many countries around the world, including neighbors Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. 

During World War II, the United States helped overthrow many Nazi Germany or imperial Japanese puppet regimes.

I've lived in Germany (a whole year though intermitently) but also in France and Spain over the last decade and my experience with the German healthcare system was much worse than that of the French or the Spanish one (hence, even though it is undeniable that the German healthcare system is reliable and qualified, it is not far from the FRench or the Spanish one). In addition, taking into account the number of tests carried out according to reliable sources, it does not show that comparatively Germany has tested much more people than Italy or Spain. In fact, while in Germany there have been done about 11,000 tests per 1M people such amount is similar in Italy it was over 11,000 as well and a bit less in the case of Spain (over 8,000) which are the three European countries that have carried out more tests.

Instead, even if the coronavirus was just a contributing factor or if it’s “assumed to have caused or contributed to death,” it can be listed as the primary cause.



The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or ICD, has established the code U07.1 for death by coronavirus infection. There’s a secondary code, U07.2, “for clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 where a laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available,” according to the CDC guidance.

“Because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the U.S., NCHS is not planning to implement U07.2 for mortality statistics.”

Therein lies the problem.

“The underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate. However, the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID- 19 being the underlying cause more often than not,” the guidelines read.

Is this new CDC guidance problematic?
“COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death. Certifiers should include as much detail as possible based on their knowledge of the case, medical records, laboratory testing, etc.,” the guidance continued.

“If the decedent had other chronic conditions such as COPD or asthma that may have also contributed, these conditions can be reported in Part II.”

Author and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, one of the few well-known figures to question some of the statistics on COVID-19, questioned the new CDC guidelines as well:

Nos trajetos e horários que ficariam vazios (com destinos comuns à parques, shoppings, etc), o número tem que ser reduzido para desencorajar a circulação desnecessária e evitar ônibus rodando vazios.

A SPTrans tem todos esses dados e espero que eles tenham sido considerados no controle de frota.

*Gestern (03.04.2020) ist eine neue Verordnung über die Beschränkung  sozialer Kontakte zur Eindämmung der Corona-Pandemie veröffentlicht worden.  Diese Verordnung enthält beispielsweise die Neuregelung, dass Bau- und  Gartenmärkte jetzt doch geöffnet haben können.*

*In einem Punkt schießt die Verordnung jedoch über das Ziel  hinaus und muss korrigiert werden: Aus dem Verordnungstext kann man  herauslesen, dass in Niedersachsen fortan auch Besuche zwischen engsten  Familienangehörigen (Eltern und Kindern) nur in sehr wenigen Konstellation  erlaubt seien. Das gelte, so der Verordnungstext, ebenso für das gegenseitige  Besuchen engster Freunde.*

*Auch wenn in der Tat die physischen Kontakte zu anderen  Menschen, die nicht zu den Angehörigen des eigenen Hausstandes gehören, auf ein  absolut nötiges Minimum reduziert werden sollten, um eine Infektion mit dem  Coronavirus zu verhindern, ist die gestern veröffentlichte Regelung zu  weitgehend. Sie wird zeitnah dergestalt geändert werden, dass Besuche im  engsten Familienkreis und unter Lebenspartnerinnen und Lebenspartnern sowie mit  wenigen engen Freunden oder sehr guten Bekannten zulässig sind. Verboten bleiben Feierlichkeiten in der eigenen Wohnung. Selbstverständlich werden bis dahin Verstöße gegen die zu ändernde Regelung nicht geahndet.* 

*Nichtsdestotrotz bitten wir die Menschen in Niedersachsen  sehr herzlich, ihre direkten physischen Kontakte so weit wie irgend möglich zu reduzieren. Es bleibt dabei: die Corona-Pandemie ist außerordentlich ernst zu nehmen und es muss uns gelingen, die Zahl der Neuinfektionen zu verringern.  Deshalb halten Sie bitte weiter Abstand voneinander!*

As an acquaintance of mine pointed out earlie, we all deal with teh crisis in our own special ways.

1.The Rich - retire to their estates, palaces etc. Appear on TV feigning concern and profiting. No need to stockpile, they have no trouble fulfilling their wants.

2. The Middle classes - work from home, realise kids are hard work and teachers have a tough job. Appear on Twitter with 1st world concerns. Stockpile.

3. The poor - go to work, risk disease, no one cares. Can't get basics because 1&2 have control of supply.

So which one are you OP?

I live in a deprived urban area in the north and I think it's a reasonable question OP

There have been gang wars kind of thing. Criminals pulling in their debts with violence, sometimes in the street. But that was more around the time of the lockdown and seems to be calming down now, hopefully.

The streets in the town/city centres seem to be really quiet from what I've seen and what others have told me.

The thugs on street corners, marking their territory are still a problem but I think the general consensus is that the police should be able to crack down even harder on these well known bullies in neighbourhood's. I think many will quietly be relishing the thought of it and understandably

People have their grumbles about the police, and always did but there is still a lot of general support in working class communities for them, and now is no exception"

Nachdem vorgestern  verschärfte Kontaktbeschränkungen in Kraft getreten sind werden diese  heute mit einer sehr....interessanten....Pressemitteilung wieder zurück  genommen. *Enge Freunde* und *sehr gute Bekannte* können sich ja schließlich gar nicht anstecken -.-

&#x200B;

*Gestern  (03.04.2020) ist eine neue Verordnung über die Beschränkung  sozialer  Kontakte zur Eindämmung der Corona-Pandemie veröffentlicht worden.   Diese Verordnung enthält beispielsweise die Neuregelung, dass Bau- und   Gartenmärkte jetzt doch geöffnet haben können.*

*In  einem Punkt schießt die Verordnung jedoch über das Ziel  hinaus und  muss korrigiert werden: Aus dem Verordnungstext kann man  herauslesen,  dass in Niedersachsen fortan auch Besuche zwischen engsten   Familienangehörigen (Eltern und Kindern) nur in sehr wenigen  Konstellation  erlaubt seien. Das gelte, so der Verordnungstext, ebenso  für das gegenseitige  Besuchen engster Freunde.*

*Auch  wenn in der Tat die physischen Kontakte zu anderen  Menschen, die nicht  zu den Angehörigen des eigenen Hausstandes gehören, auf ein  absolut  nötiges Minimum reduziert werden sollten, um eine Infektion mit dem   Coronavirus zu verhindern, ist die gestern veröffentlichte Regelung zu   weitgehend. Sie wird zeitnah dergestalt geändert werden, dass Besuche im   engsten Familienkreis und unter Lebenspartnerinnen und Lebenspartnern  sowie mit  wenigen engen Freunden oder sehr guten Bekannten zulässig  sind. Verboten bleiben Feierlichkeiten in der eigenen Wohnung.  Selbstverständlich werden bis dahin Verstöße gegen die zu ändernde  Regelung nicht geahndet.*

*Nichtsdestotrotz  bitten wir die Menschen in Niedersachsen  sehr herzlich, ihre direkten  physischen Kontakte so weit wie irgend möglich zu reduzieren. Es bleibt  dabei: die Corona-Pandemie ist außerordentlich ernst zu nehmen und es  muss uns gelingen, die Zahl der Neuinfektionen zu verringern.  Deshalb  halten Sie bitte weiter Abstand voneinander!*

1.  The US Government has announced that all coronavirus treatment will be paid either by your health insurance or the US government if you are uninsured. 

2.  The US population will not be cut in half.  In the worst case scenario, about 80% of the total population would get infected. Of all infections, 2% will die. So 350Mill x 0.8 x 0.02 = 5.6Million deaths. That’s the worst case. It’s a lot of deaths but not half of 350 Million.  

Trump has been declaring 100,000 then 200K and now 300K deaths projected. I think these are laughably optimistic numbers. We will see at least 1 Million deaths but I cannot trust government statistics to be truthful by then.  

I am not an optimist but we will recover because the population WILL reach a herd immunity. Either by vaccine or by recovered cases or both. The reign of COVID19 is finite. There is an end date. It’s just gonna be a while. I think 18 months. I base that on an early report by the Imperial College of London. This whole easing off and opening the economy by June is laughable."

I was fortunate in that I never had to engage in much direct conflict, but what I observed in that society changed me forever. The complete destruction of a society, infrastructure that was practically non-existent, and children playing soccer amongst unexploded ordinance and rotting corpses. These were things that had never entered my relatively sheltered life in America. Sure, I had had my share of grief and challenges.  I’m a little older and didn’t live what people in my country would consider a charmed life up until that point, but I had had advantages I never fully appreciated until my experiences in a war zone. I didn’t realize how much it changed me until I came back home. I was shocked at what people categorized as existential problems. Some 400 lb person on their scooter bitches about the long line at the supermarket and how unbelievable the whole thing is. That’s not a real problem. What we’re going through now, that’s a real problem, and even still, not on nearly the scale that people have faced all over the world at practically every point in history. A FB friend of mine from college recently posted that “this is one of the worst periods of human history.” I question now whether that person has ever been in the same room with a history book. I see people on social media with unbelievably lavish luxuries such as nice cars, expensive clothes and electronics and who take trips to exotic locales on a regular basis. They seem to have it all and it’s all together. Now, those same people are in dire straights, complaining about the relatively minor interruptions to their lives and incomes. Not to say they aren’t suffering, but perhaps the excesses they once thought defined life will no longer seem as important. I’ve got friends, even family, who worked (past tense is intentional) in the hospitality industry and as recently as last month touted their immense social value and how important they must be for the perks of their positions. Now, they’re sheltering in place and unemployed. It’s not that they deserved it, but I think we’re all learning very quickly what it means to be essential to society. Maybe in the future, we can have some better understanding of the delineation between what’s required and what’s just nice. I want to reiterate that I’m not happy people are suffering or that they’re sick and dying. I’m simply positing that this may lend some much needed perspective to a society which has been sorely lacking that perspective during the recent history of unprecedented prosperity and convenience."

Reinfection is definitely not common at all. I'm not virologist, but common sense informs us that if it was a common issue we would hear about it and see it. 

The reality of the matter is that scientists just don't know for certain yet. Some other coronaviruses and seasonal flus do reinfect people. There were a few reports of this happening with coronavirus survivors in China, but those claims do not have a definite reliable source, have not be tested clinically or confirmed by any medical institutions, and have been sensationalized by media. No one can give you a definite yes or no on reinfection risk.

I do think Bob and Abe hanging out is a bad idea though, not because of risk of reinfection for Bob, but because Bob and all his clothes and belongings would be contaminated after visiting Abe and anything Bob touches on his way home would be at risk. If he doesn't sanitize properly he could spread it to healthy friends. 

I'm no virologist, this is just my interpretation based on the the sanitation standards I've been informed of. Imagine a doctor who is immune and caring for a sick patient. They would still wear gloves, mask, and gown so that they do not accidentally spread the patients illness to others through contact. The doctor themself is not at risk, but they recognize that they can be a vector for transmitting it to others. This is Bob's situation"

We know that the virus generally takes several days to show up as symptoms in a patient. I’ve heard average around 5 days after infection. So I think it’s safe to assume, that this virus “cycles” at a slower rate than an influenza strain.  Say it takes anywhere from 72 hrs to 120 hrs for the virus to replicate or “cycle” as opposed the Flu which does it at 6 hrs. Then it would make sense that some people that were initially infected with a low viral load only show very minor symptoms or none at all.  If they got a low initial viral load, their immune system maybe was able to suppress it before it got large enough to overwhelm them and cause more severe symptoms.  That would also seem to pair with how we’re seeing deaths that come 3-4 weeks after infection and people with prolonged illness compared w the Flu. If you dont fight off the virus before it’s first cycle, then it becomes more severe. If you had a high initial viral load, then it becomes harder to fight it off before it’s next cycle. Would also explain why lots of docs and healthcare workers seem to be dying, perhaps because of repeated exposure causing the viral load to remain high."

As someone that works in medical research, I can't imagine his frustration, and the frustration of the other physicians and nurses on the frontlines, but I can assure him that the scientific community is already fully engaged in trying to find out everything we can about this virus and the disease to develop treatment options and vaccines as quickly as possible. Indeed, as the recent explosion of computing power made available to the Folding@home and similar projects has shown, the general public has even made their resources available and joined the scientific community in this work. This is one reason why the general public is seeing the news of several ""cures"" being published by the media. There has already been an explosion of research, and the the media has latched on to any scrap of promising research, even before any of it has been peer reviewed, yet alone replicated.

>A customer of a Sherbrooke Walmart dissatisfied with the social distancing rules imposed in the store tried to kill a security guard by rushing at him with his car, before fleeing.

>The event occurred around 5:00 p.m. Saturday night. At that time, the client, a 25-year-old man, came to the store with his wife. However, Walmart management accepts only one customer at a time per vehicle, in order to limit the number of people in the establishment during this pandemic period, explained Sherbrooke police on Sunday.

>A security guard intervened and the couple left the store, but continued the argument in the parking lot. Then, the man, driving his vehicle, rushed on the agent, dragging him on his hood for several meters, before making a maneuver to throw him on the ground. The suspect then fled.

>The worker suffered serious head injuries and was still fighting for his life on Sunday morning.

>The driver, for his part, was found in a home in Sherbrooke and arrested during the evening. ""He is facing charges of armed assault with a vehicle, aggravated assault and a hit and run,"" said police, adding that he was scheduled to appear on Sunday.

>The agent's employer, TITAN Security, denounced this ""tragic incident"" caused by an ""enraged customer"".

>""We are deeply saddened by this unprovoked aggression in times of national crisis where we are all trying to enforce the urgent regulations implemented by our government,"" the company said on its Facebook page on Sunday.

>A [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.tiing.ca/soutien-a-lagent-de-securite-percute-au-walmart-de-fleurimont) was launched on the Tiing website to help the worker and his family. It had raised more than $ 400 at 11 a.m. Sunday morning.

>TITAN Security also promised to support its employee and his family.

>For his part, the director of the Sherbrooke Police Service, Danny McConnell, launched an “appeal for calm” with his fellow citizens affected by the coronavirus crisis.

>""I urge people to respect officers and employees who just enforce basic rules for your protection,"" said McConnell in a statement.

>The suspect is facing charges of armed assault with a vehicle, aggravated assault and hit and run. He is scheduled to appear on Sunday. The charges could change if the victim's condition changes. They could be even more serious if the worst could happen, said the SPS spokesperson.

>As for his spouse, she should not be charged. ""In our investigation so far there will be no charges for the passenger"", clarified Martin Carrier.

>Police are still expected to meet with witnesses on Sunday. The investigation is still ongoing, said Martin Carrier. There are certain areas that we will have to check, meetings of witnesses that will have to be done again on Sunday to allow us to bring other elements in this file.

>The family of the victim, saying they were in shock, did not want to comment on the event. However, the victim's brother shared a message on Facebook.

>> ""Yesterday we were going to pick up my brother after work, but it was a crime scene that we found. Because someone refused social distancing, he told himself that trying to get my brother away from his five children and his wife, perhaps forever, would relieve his frustration.""

>Walmart's senior director of public affairs, Steeve Azoulay, said by email that he was very saddened to hear of this incident. In his message, Mr. Azoulay reminds that the store has introduced new social distancing protocols in order to protect our associates and our customers and we strongly encourage all Canadians to join them.

The same mechanism that stops malaria from getting its hands on hemoglobin and gobbling it up seems to do the same to COVID-19 (essentially little snippets of DNA in an envelope) from binding to it.

HCQ doesn't bind to DNA.  COVID19 virus is RNA-based not DNA based.  HCQ is thought to work [due to two mechanisms](https://www.livescience.com/chloroquine-coronavirus-treatment.html):

>Chloroquine interferes with the virus's ability to replicate in two ways. First, the drug enters compartments called endosomes within the cell membrane. Endosomes tend to be slightly acidic, but the chemical structure of the drug boosts their pH, making the compartments more basic. Many viruses, including SARS-CoV, acidify endosomes in order to breach the cell membrane, release their genetic material and begin replication; chloroquine blocks this critical step.

>The drug also prevents SARS-CoV from plugging into a receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2, on primate cells, according to the 2005 report. When the virus inserts its spike protein into the ACE2 receptor, it sets off a chemical process that alters the structure of the receptor and allows the virus to infect. An adequate dose of chloroquine appears to undermine this process, and in turn, viral replication in general, the authors noted.

[BTW here is the reference to the viral glycoproteins binding to heme and freeing iron](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/COVID-19_Disease_ORF8_and_Surface_Glycoprotein_Inhibit_Heme_Metabolism_by_Binding_to_Porphyrin/11938173)




Given the evidence that a malaria treatment works against COVID19 and the evidence for heme-related oxidative stress in COVID19, it is interesting that there exists another connection between malaria resistance, heme, and oxidative stress.

One mechanism by which malarial resistance is conferred is by sickle-cell trait.

[According to this article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20450-how-sickle-cell-carriers-fend-off-malaria/), a byproduct of heterozyogous sickle cell (one copy), which confers resistance to malaria, is the production of low levels of carbon monoxide in the blood...which is what in turn confers malarial disease resistance via [anti-inflammatory activity and cytotoxic T-cell immune downregulation](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(14\)00448-3).  

The carbon monoxide that arises due to sickle cell is actually due to the fact that sickle cell results in higher than normal free heme, which promotes its breakdown via heme oxygenase-1, which causes carbon monoxide, which binds to free heme (free heme is released into the blood [due to malarial red blood cell lysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00109-008-0368-5)).  CO binding to free heme inactivates it and thereby reduces oxidative stress, and CO also downregulates cytotoxic T-cells, reducing tissue damage while anti-malarial medications work to kill the parasite."

the person you replied to is saying that mathematically, that may not be true. for example, consider an elderly at risk victim of coronavirus may have been likely to die on saturday regardless of coronavirus. in that case, they would have been part of the 7778 expected deaths for saturday. so there would still expected to be 7777 non coronavirus deaths, but now we also have 1 coronavirus death. the total mortality rate has not changed in this example.

The reason why they chose a coronavirus for their fake pandemic is because it is so common pretty much anyone will test positive and they can manipulate the numbers however they see fit.

Also every year about 2% of people die of resperatory issues, that number hasn't changed despite of this new virus, I wonder why, maybe because covid-19 is in fact, just the regular flu.

To claim that it's a virus which is sent by God for CAA and NRC and is for non Muslims is disgusting. People rightfully got detested by it. On the top of it,Jamaat members were busy hiding themselves. What would any sane person think when he or she would see both of these together? 

The fact that some Muslims tried to link a secular tragedy to Religion wasn't lost on People. The deliberate laxity of the Jamaat only strengthened the feeling. I am an Apostate,the videos were targeted towards me too,so I felt enraged at the videos too. 

The Coronavirus pandemic had little to do with Religion. Even the most Looney Hindu Fundamentalists didn't blame it on the Muslims but suggested cow urine as a remedy. It wasn't ever Communal. The whole thing of Coronavirus being a god sent virus was started by tiktok guys. It became communal when some Muslims (admittedly a vocal minority) started treating this as a result of the CAA and NRC debate. 

The communalism started when the tiktokers said this was a virus mean for those who supported the CAA. Loose talks like these benefit no one. 

Because it is difficult to track. Do you really think not one person had the virus and didn't spread it in the jam-packed crowds?

//

Well,you're not basing it on evidence. You're assuming that the virus may have spread without any hard evidence. Even then,those Hindu festivals were criticised. No one supported the organisers or levelled accusations of Hinduphobia. 

There were tonnes of mosques which had group sessions,no one is blaming any other Islamic organisation due to the same reason. It's based upon evidence. We have evidence of the Jamaat's laxity (deliberate?) being the reason of the spread. 

_________-___________

And if someone is defending what the jamat did as right, they are very wrong.//

This is what people are against. The Jamaat deliberately and defiantly went ahead with the makraz. 

Many FB pages are busy defending the Jamaat and are calling for the FIRs to be withdrawn. Perhaps we shouldn't turn a blind eye to these pages and should counter them instead of offering platitudes? It's clear that the jamaat is to blame for 30% of the infections right now. 

________-________
 But if someone is defending the jamat saying they are not the reason for the whole spread in India, rather they are trackable, and they are similarly guilty as other religious groups who behaved irresponsibly not taking it seriously, they are correct.

//

1. Maybe because of different places and circumstances. I saw a video of Muslims in mosques being punished by dandas.

//

That's what my point is. The administration right now is impartial. So this whole narrative of muslims being the victim doesn't work. You break the rules,you suffer the consequences, regardless of Religion. 

__________-___________

2. What the jamat did was definitely very wrong, but unless proven otherwise, all superstitious people were not taking stuff seriously and did not process the consequences of the virus would be so dire. Take NRIs taking crocin to stop fevers at airports during checkup, do you really think they intended to commit terrorism?

//

With the Jamaat,there comes in the problem of Islamist ideology. NRIs regardless of Religion did it to escape quarantines..but then when you see people say that this is a Conspiracy against Islam,and then say that the virus is meant for Non Muslims and DELIBERATELY wipe their noses and make tik tok videos on how it's going to affect CAA supporters,one can obviously guess people would be troubled. 

_________-____________

3. No, even if it was construed that way, it would still be justified to ban them. It would have eventually made sense looking back.//

Looking back,the same voices alleging Islamophobia now,would be even more loud. There have been accusations of Islamophobia despite the jamaat contributing to the count by its deliberate recklessness and individual Muslims posting communal videos. If the government would have banned the Makraz,it would have been constructed as yet another Islamophobic act. 


_______-_________

But anyway, since Hindu festivals were allowed to continue too, the problem people have is why are Muslims being targeted by corona-jihad? How is it any different than what others did?

//

That's deliberate red herring. No one had banned festivals. Delhi had put restrictions on any gathering >200 people since 13th of March. 

The Jamaat organisers deliberately ran against the order,didn't disband when asked to,made a mockery out of the Restrictions,said that the restrictions were a conspiracy against Islam,and lastly started hiding their members once the police started hunting them. 

__________-______________

4. Again, they were very wrong, but I don't know how you can say they intended to cause more harm./

Well, the reason as to why it was deliberate is because Saad mocked the social distancing measures. To not follow it is one thing,to be conscious and avoid following it is something else. He went a step further. He even mocked it. 

There were videos on Tiktok which said that the virus was a curse by God and it was an NRC sent by god-

""Welcome to India, coronavirus. To the ones who were asking for our NRC, my God (Allah)’s NRC is now being implemented. Now only He will decide who will stay and who will go."" 

Some on Tiktok deliberately lied and said that none of the Makraz attendees tested positive. Some licked currency notes. 

If you still think that these actions were not deliberate,then I guess it's futile to discuss. As to why it these videos were linked to the event? It's because these tiktokers defended the event. 

You're free to argue if welcoming the virus and calling it an NRC Isn't actually intending for the virus to spread. 

 They believed that there was no way around it//

13-22 is ample time my friend. 

______-________

which is stupid and why religion is very harmful, but weren't Hindus who continued with their festivals essentially believing the same thing?//

Yet to see similar Hindu videos welcoming the coronavirus by saying it on air..that wouldn't make sense because the government itself is against it and is a Hindu nationalist govt."

A lot of countries still haven't hit their ""peak"" in terms of case numbers or deaths yet due to COVID-19. Worldwide we are at over 66,000 recorded deaths this far, and this number will keep rising. 

In the terms of the seasonal flu statistic that's listed, it's seasonal whereas the coronavirus is not, so cases and deaths will continue to rise worldwide. I am unsure if these numbers are accurate for the statistics listed ... But a better comparison would've been between COVID-19 and the seasonal flu, Spanish flu, SARS, MERS, Ebola, Measles, etc. 

Also, staying home wouldn't affect the other statistics (except traffic fatalities) even though they may be considered public health issues. Staying home for COVID-19 can reduce the spread of the virus which is meant to protect the health of everyone, especially those who are vulnerable. If we were not staying home, the death rate would be even higher. And unfortunately, in the United States we are still just getting started."

Do you think the President of the United States should just sit there like a little baby and accept these fake and slanderous accusations against our military and country?

Do you think the President has the prerogative to combat propaganda with facts?

Here are some numerous indisputable facts about the Chinese virus.

1. The Chinese virus originated in China. First case of the virus was in November 17

https://amp.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back

2. China threatened doctors and destroyed evidence in order to suppress the magnitude of the Chinese Virus

https://www.thedailybeast.com/china-silenced-doctor-who-first-raised-alarm-about-coronovirus-nyt-reports

3. On January 14, the WHO and Chinese authorities released this statement: ""preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the novel corona virus identified in Wuhan.""

4. 10 days after that statement, China locked down Wuhan. However, 5 million people left Wuhan before the lockdown 

https://www.businessinsider.com/5-million-left-wuhan-before-coronavirus-quarantine-2020-1


In summary, China waited two months before taking tangible action to stop the Chinese virus. They destroyed evidence, threatened doctors, and lied to the world about the transmission.

China is unequivocally responsible for the Chinese virus. They will pay for it!"

>A security guard intervened and the couple left the store, but continued the argument in the parking lot. Then, the man, driving his vehicle, rushed on the agent, dragging him on his hood for several meters, before making a maneuver to throw him on the ground. The suspect then fled.

>The worker suffered serious head injuries and was still fighting for his life on Sunday morning.

>The agent's employer, TITAN Security, denounced this ""tragic incident"" caused by an ""enraged customer"".

>""We are deeply saddened by this unprovoked aggression in times of national crisis where we are all trying to enforce the urgent regulations implemented by our government,"" the company said on its Facebook page on Sunday.

>A [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.tiing.ca/soutien-a-lagent-de-securite-percute-au-walmart-de-fleurimont) was launched on the Tiing website to help the worker and his family. It had raised more than $ 400 at 11 a.m. Sunday morning.

>Police are still expected to meet with witnesses on Sunday. The investigation is still ongoing, said Martin Carrier. There are certain areas that we will have to check, meetings of witnesses that will have to be done again on Sunday to allow us to bring other elements in this file.

Chinese officials note serious problems in coronavirus response. The World Health Organization keeps praising them.

China's Surveillance State Should Scare Everyone-The country is perfecting a vast network of digital espionage as a means of social control—with implications for democracies worldwide.

Congress Tries to Sneak Through Dangerous Spying Bill Under the Cover of the Coronavirus Crisis - WASHINGTON - Leading members of the House of Representatives are rushing a vote on Wednesday to extend abusive government surveillance powers before they’re set to expire on March 15.

If approved, the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2020 would reauthorize Section 215 powers Congress established under the USA Patriot Act in 2001. Section 215 is the provision national-security agencies have cited to support their unwarranted collection of phone records of hundreds of millions of people in the United States.

Fox is [saying](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxnews.com/us/uss-theodore-roosevelt-commanding-officer-relieved.amp) he was relieved after being *accused* of leaking the letter which is technically true but misleading.

Blaming ""the media"" for any opinion makes about as much sense as blaming ""the auto industry"" because one maker had to recall a specific engine in 2018. 

""The media"" consists of tens of thousands of journalists - with varying degrees of education, integrity, and experience - which allows for virtually any agenda to be promoted or defused; *especially* within opinion pieces, which I'd wager every single one of those headlines above is pulled from. The problem is that most people (at least in America) seem to have no ability to discern between subjectivity and objectivity and how they relate to actual *news* vs opinion. 

The president downplaying the coronavirus pandemic is news; it's a fact.

You mean the time he told Duterte that the US had subs outside North Korea? Because that was all fake news, he could have figured that out if he just looked up CNN. 

[Here is CNN Talking about those same exact subs arriving in South Korea, three days **before** Trump called Duterte talking about having subs stationed in south Korea.](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/24/politics/uss-michigan-nuclear-sub-south-korea/index.html)

Which is funny, because a few days later, CNN would print articles condemning Trump for telling someone about the subs they had already reported on publicly.

[Hell, here is a picture of the sub arriving in South Korea, taken before Trump's phone call.](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2017/04/USS20Michigan_1493079391774_20101622_ver1.0.jpg?w=640&h=360&crop=1&resize=1280,720)

The subs were there to intimidate North Korea, how would keeping them a secret intimidate them?

> A carrier group was going to...bomb Hong Kong to prevent China from taking over?

Are you being willfully obtuse? 

You do know China has been threatening to conquer Hong kong and Taiwan right? The carrier was there to signal to China that they better not try anything.

This is not exactly the ideal time for fleet commanders to ignore the chain of command, and handing over sensitive operational and fleet readiness information to China. Or do you disagree?

Here is an article from three days ago...

[China’s Military Advances Under Cover of Coronavirus](https://www.thetrumpet.com/22167-chinas-military-advances-under-cover-of-coronavirus) 

Just one month ago, congress signed into law the TAIPEI act, promising to protect Hong Kong and Taiwan militarily. 

> Careful now! If you set the bar there you're going to implicate Donnie and Ivanka too.

By all mean, When did they send classified information? i want sources, because that would be criminal.

> Sure you wanna do that? (:

Yes i sure as fuck am! :D

Man you guys always fall back on this conspiratorial shit when you've got no where else to go. They're individual people and they probably had individual reasons for why they endorsed Biden. But I think for all of them, among the top reasons is that they don't think Bernie has a good chance of winning and they don't think Bernie has demonstrated the ability to expand his coalition beyond those who already support him and view Biden as superior in both respects. Both are valid reasons. 

> Sanders ran that campaign not because he was dumb, but because, that was the primary field he entered into!

And who could have predicted that the field would shrink! That's coronavirus levels of ""No one ever saw this coming!""

When they arrived at the airport, they were to undergo a coronavirus test and an MRI scan (both at their expense), if they were sick, to hospital, if they were healthy, to quarantine.

Quarantine is at an assigned location, typically a converted hotel. No outside contact, nor any outside food or drink allowed in\*.

The quality of your stay at that facility really depended on how comfortable the location was before it was converted, and also how much of a power trip the local officials were going through after being assigned this position.

Again the entire cost of the stay, just like the medical tests, would be entirely at their expense\*\*

The in-laws have had contact with people who have had an ""okay"" time, and also a terrible time.

\*This was particularly worrying for my MIL who has a lot of dietary issues. No outside food, and a more ""tyrannical"" official could equal a bad time.

\*\*I never get a straight answer out of them about what happens if somebody cannot pay"

Elon is still right; the panic about coronavirus is the most dangerous part. It IS dumb.

You think it’s a big deal to our country that a million old people might die? No. It’s not. We’re all numbers to the gov and that’s acceptable losses.

Is it a big deal that it destroyed the average consumer’s faith in the economy? Yes. That is what the government is fighting. No one actually gives a shit about corona, but the dominoes it’s knocking down are hefty. That’s why we’re literally at UNLIMITED QUANTITATIVE EASING. You probably don’t even understand the ramifications of that if you think musk was wrong.

The generations ahead of us are going to get fucked by how we’re choosing to fight this. Extreme inflation in the future.

If I offer you the choice between a ford or a lamborghini, do you really care what colour the lambo is? I have no doubt that Starmer, Nandy and RLB would all be far better leaders of our country than any Tory therefore I would happily support any of them, it really is that simple for me. The only thing that makes me lose support for a Labour leader is if they get trashed in an election, hence why I wanted Corbyn out as soon as the 2019 figures were in. The only thing that makes a good Labour leader (given the fact as I've already said I don't think any of the current options are capable of being bad for the country if they're in power) is winning elections, and so I back the leaders who I think are most capable of doing that when it comes to choosing one. Now that Keir is leader he will stay there until he loses an election in my mind, no ifs or buts. 

Yes I do know that Corbyn believed in all the manifesto policies, so did I. That doesn't make me anything special. Most of us on this sub have a boner for nationalisation and forcing the large companies and the super rich to pay their fair share. Making those policies part of the manifesto is literally the bare minimum Corbyn could have done. Staying consistent does not take courage, going against what you personally believe in because you think it will win the election takes courage. It didn't work for Ed and he was ultimately the wrong man for the job, whatever. We tried, we failed, we try again. Now it's Starmers turn and my head says in all likelihood he's going to fail too, but I will back him up until that day with everything I have. If he fails, we move on from him and someone else picks up the torch and tries again. The way I see it every election cycle is fresh, this one is especially given how coronavirus has managed to finally get Brexit out of the news. Corbyn does not own the rights to nationalisation, we the Labour party do. He was always just the figurehead, nothing more."

I think Corbyn is probably a very nice man, with his heart in the right place, who sincerely believes in the policies he has advocated. I also think he's been an ineffective leader for Labour during a critical period, and that for far too long he stubbornly refused to acknowledge that and allow someone more effective to take over, and that the result has been damaging for Labour and also for UK politics as a whole.

I'm not going to get into the whole ""it was a costed manifesto"" again. That costing been debunked so many times that it's not worth going over it again. And yes, the current government is also going on a heck of a spending spree in response to the coronavirus situation. We're all going to be paying for it for a long time afterwards, with Sunak already all but announcing significant tax rises for some parts of the population.

If you apply for $12,000 dollars, you will get another loan for $2000, and be on the hook for all $12000.

Unable to pay off a goodly portion of its debt ceiling of 26+ trillion owed to China the USA has been racking up debt with a default and destroy plan because money is an economic weapon. 

The Trump administration went with a variation on this plan to make China a vile monster to whom no one owed anything (easily done considering they were 'godless little yellow people' and 'not even human'), effectively justifying an economy smashing default.
So, a biological containment failure had to happen at a lab in Wuhan. The deathtoll, and economic disaster that follows would serve as justification of a backlash against communist china to the point eventually there would be a vilification of China by everyone.
A 'papertrail' from the Wuhan lab would need to be found indicating that someone in the lab had died from the coronavirus, the government covered it up, and thus we get the investigations of a youtuber:

In 2019 the lab is looking to employ people in researching a bat virus that can jump to humans- its already been found infecting some villagers earlier in the year. Heading it up is a chinese scientist refered to as 'the bat lady'. In december another female scientist working in the lab is suddenly erased from the records of being employed there-poorly.
The conclusion is that there has been an accident and specifically multiple vials of corona virus have been spilled and this disappeared scientist is patient zero."

At the time, 2/3rds of patients could trace back to contact to the Wuhan fish market where they think the outbreak originated. At the time r0 was unknown and they never said that person to person spread *couldn't* happen. 

From a [January 15th speech from the WHO director general](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-statement-on-the-advice-of-the-ihr-emergency-committee-on-novel-coronavirus): We know that there is human-to-human transmission in China, but for now it appears limited to family groups and health workers caring for infected patients.

At this time, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen.

There is still a lot we don’t know. We don’t know the source of this virus, we don’t understand how easily it spreads, and we don’t fully understand its clinical features or severity.

That's less than a week before they acknowledged person to person transmission being a major cause. It wasn't so much that China was ""hiding information"" but perhaps we just weren't paying enough attention.

But we aren't gifted with foresight. We want to be proactive, but at not all outbreaks are going to become pandemics like COVID-19. How do we know which ones to be careful about, and which ones will fizzle out on their own? According to the WHO, [Our surveillance teams identify, on average, two disease outbreak events every week](https://www.who.int/westernpacific/news/commentaries/detail-hq/coronavirus-outbreak-shows-asia-needs-to-step-up-infection-preparation) and the context in which these events occur is far more complex than before, due to rapid urbanization and dramatic increases in the movement of people and goods."

2020-04-05,Wisdom-Speaker,Coronavirusbayarea,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirusbayarea/comments/fvgjrm/covid_in_bay_area_la_california_cases_confirmed/fmi915a/,"Final daily update of the COVID growth chart for Bay Area, LA and California. (New type of graph likely, but I need a couple days to get it organized.)

Bay Area COVID confirmed-case curve is bending, but still doubled this week. But hospital space looking ok. Maybe we are clearing older cases fast enough to accommodate the new ones?  

LA has lost the race and overtaken the Bay Area to become ""the hot spot"" in California. The California curve isn't bending enough either. We need to ramp up Shelter-in-Place 2.0 statewide, and get everyone using masks and other means to slow the spread. That's what will allow people to go back to work, without overwhelming the hospitals.

California is overshooting the South Korean ""success"" curve, but can we avoid becoming another Italian or Spanish tragedy? I had expected more cases in CA due to the immense test backlog, but that was cleared over the past 2 days, and nearly all of the \~45,000 lagged tests were negatives. Whew!  Now the backlog is only a couple of days, and testing should improve further per state announcements yesterday.

Since 3/31, California's daily reports include hospital and ICU bed usage for both confirmed and suspected cases. Hospital usage has been stable (within 10-12%) for the past 4 days.  ICU space is available but in tighter supply than hospital beds generally. [Data now available from Santa Clara County](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/phd/DiseaseInformation/novel-coronavirus/Pages/dashboard.aspx#hospital) show 38% of ICU space used for other needs, 30% for COVID care, and 32% available. So I made an initial preliminary estimate that perhaps Bay Area can handle double the current caseload without having to leave people to die (""triage""). This seems consistent with reporting I've seen from the hospitals, who are feeling largely spared so far. Much depends on case progression rates, timing of tests, and the demographics of who gets hit next - a couple of major nursing home outbreaks could flood the ICUs. Or if a cluster of hospitalized patients all need ICU care faster than current ICU patients resolve. 

Various county, state and federal guidelines now support [use of personal face coverings when outside the home](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Face-Coverings-Guidance.aspx) \- it confirms you're aware of what it means to be in a pandemic, helps keep you from touching contaminated hands to your face, and reduces any virus you might be exposed to by 50-85%. Masks also help prevent you from inadvertently infecting anyone else - right now anyone might be a symptom-free spreader and not know it. Guidance is to avoid wearing N95 or surgical mask unless you have a medical need; those are in short supply and a kitchen towel (made into a bandana) works almost as well as a surgical mask. I like mine just a tad moist, since that's what works to trap dust and pollen.

I think we've worked out how to stop this virus, and now we're into the next stage. Will the goal be to eradicate the virus, or do we need to restart the economy while accepting that many more people will be heading to the hospitals as a result?  Either way, the next stage will require some new metrics, so I am working on some new graphs. I'll post when I have something worth sharing again.

It boils down to this: we can't restart the economy until we control the spread. So everything we do to stop the spread also brings back jobs that much faster. Make sure everyone knows this and gets serious!

**Techie Details:**

Plot shows confirmed cases per million population for Bay Area (red), all of California (magenta), LA County (black line), Italy (green) and South Korea (blue). Plot uses a log scale in order to show wide range of data. On a log scale, exponential growth behavior appears as a straight line. The black diagonal dashed line shows the common early trend with doubling every 3.2 days.

Data outside of Bay Area come from the [Johns Hopkins ArcGIS dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/2019-nCoV). Bay Area data pulled daily from each county's public health website: Alameda (Oakland) including Berkeley (separate report), Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara (San Jose), Solano and Sonoma Counties. California data now being taken from CA state site, except for 3/28 when they took a day off.

Korea, Bay Area and California data have been time-shifted to line up with Italy in the section from 10-50 cases per million population. In that section, all 4 geographic regions followed the common trend. If you are interested in these sorts of graphs, and want to look at other states or countries, I highly recommend the [91-DIVOC website](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/).

How each region ""bends the curve"" depends on local actions. Some of those are marked on the graph using + symbols for key changes in public health response. COVID is currently the leading daily cause of death in Italy, by a wide margin. Everyone wants to avoid that scenario!

Across California, unless we continue to curtail the exponential growth, any boost in capacity will be filled within a few days. Fatality rates multiply \~5-10x wherever the caseload overloads hospitals. In that scenario COVID hurts not just infected people, but everyone needing hospitals who can no longer get adequate care."

You also need to have a high rate of tests per million population. This is demonstrated by what South Korea did. 

In my state of Alaska, which benefited from seeing what was happening in Seattle, our positive to total tests percentage is 2.8 percent and our tests per million is 8256. Arizona has a 7.4 percent positive rate and only 3731 tests per million. A lot of infected are not being counted in Arizona, leading to the prospect that the health care system could be overwhelmed when they get flooded by severe cases of covid-19. This might be even more true given that the major metropolitan areas have large numbers of people over 65.

#####Captain Crozier was fired after a leak of a letter he had emailed to Navy leaders detailing the service's failures in dealing with a coronavirus outbreak on the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt.


*By John Ismay  /  April 5, 2020, 11:55 a.m. ET*

Capt. Brett E. Crozier, the Navy captain who was removed from command of the coronavirus-stricken aircraft carrier U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, has tested positive for Covid-19, according to two Naval Academy classmates of Crozier’s who are close to him and his family.

A Navy spokesman declined to comment on Crozier’s Covid status.

The commander began exhibiting symptoms before he was removed from the warship on Thursday, two of his classmates said. Crozier was fired following a leak to The San Francisco Chronicle of a letter he had emailed to Navy leaders that detailed the failures on the service’s part to provide the necessary resources to swiftly move sailors off the carrier and disinfect areas on board as the virus spread through the ship.

Thomas B. Modly, the acting secretary of the Navy, said he had lost confidence in Crozier’s ability to command the ship effectively as it dealt with the evolving crisis after Crozier sent the letter on an unclassified email system to 20 to 30 people. Sending such a letter, Modly said, caused unnecessary alarm about the operational readiness of the ship and undermined the chain of command. “In sending it out pretty broadly, he did not take care to ensure that it couldn’t be leaked,” Modly said. “And that’s part of his responsibility.”

In a briefing Saturday, President Trump offered support for Modly’s decision. “He shouldn’t be talking that way in a letter,” the president said of Crozier. “I thought it was terrible what he did.”

Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that there were 155 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among sailors aboard the aircraft carrier, and that more than half of the ship had been tested. So far there have been no hospitalizations.

“There is an investigation ongoing,” Esper said of Crozier’s actions. “All the services at times relieve commanders without the benefit of an investigation up front because they’ve lost confidence in them. It’s certainly not unique to the Navy.”

The news of Crozier’s diagnosis is likely to fuel further skepticism of the Navy’s handling of the outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier, which has already received notable criticism from the rank and file. On Friday, videos circulated showing hundreds of sailors aboard the Roosevelt cheering for Crozier as he disembarked the ship. Memes depicting the Navy captain rescuing his sailors from a burning building over saving his own career sprouted up across social media.

Crozier’s firing has also raised concerns with Democratic lawmakers. In a statement, the Democratic leaders of the House Armed Services Committee condemned his removal, although they acknowledged that Crozier might have made missteps in his handling of the situation. “Captain Crozier was justifiably concerned about the health and safety of his crew, but he did not handle the immense pressure appropriately,” the lawmakers said. “However, relieving him of his command is an overreaction.”

“Throwing the commanding officer overboard without a thorough investigation is not going to solve the growing crisis aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt,” the lawmakers added.

On Sunday, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. expressed criticism of the Navy’s actions on ABC’s “This Week,” saying, “I think it’s close to criminal the way they’re dealing with this guy.”

“I think he should have a commendation rather than be fired,” Biden added.

A Navy spokesman said that Crozier has been reassigned to the headquarters of the Naval Air Forces Pacific command in San Diego, but that he must complete a quarantine period first.

The captain was being quarantined in “distinguished visitors quarters” on Naval Base Guam, according to two of his classmates. It is unclear when he was first tested for Covid-19 or when he received his results.

All sailors who are evacuated from the Theodore Roosevelt must have a negative test result for Covid-19 before they can be quarantined ashore. At least 400 from the vessel were expected to be sent to hotels in Guam on Sunday, according to Mary Rhodes, the president of the Guam Hotel and Restaurant Association, who is helping the Navy with the logistics of these transfers. “This is an emergent situation and a humanitarian effort,” said Rhodes. “We have 13 hotels to receive up to 4,000 military personnel.”

The sailors will join roughly 625 other service members from the Roosevelt who have already tested negative for the virus and have been sent to quarantine in hotels over the past few days.

You're trying to push me to positions I don't want to defend and don't actually disagree with. Not like you give a shit because I'm not left leaning and therefore wrong, but here goes. 

To start with, at no point did I say the federal response did not suck. The difference is you seem bent on pinning it all on Trump when that's just not the case. The CDC has been nothing but a detriment. We'd literally be better off without their red tape tying up and slowing down private labs trying to produce and distribute COVID-19 tests. Washington should have moved faster, I also agree. But in January everyone was too busy impeaching Trump to care about this. You blame Trump. I blame all of them. A few select senators on both sides of the aisle saw this coming but most of the ones that really matter were too busy pushing their own agenda to care. 

The federal government is the backup to the states. Not the other way around. But, I'll leave Cuomo alone here. Even when Cuomo realized shit was going south, Deblasio flat out ignored both Cuomo and Trump and not only did nothing, he encouraged NYC to go about their daily lives like nothing happened. Try as you might, that isn't Trump's fault. And as a result of this, new York is reaching a point of not what, should he do, what *can* he do? Like I said, objective number one, if anything, is to keep the spread at a slow enough pace to not overload hospitals. If you want to say, that window has since passed and we're in the shit, I can't disagree and we're watching it play out in NYC. More rural areas are less susceptible to exponential spread due to fewer people in a given area. The hope is that people listen to guidelines in rural areas and the virus doesn't firmly take hold, if not.. Things, will get ugly.

If you want to actually discuss things, you're more than welcome to. But so far you've done nothing but what amounts to Orange Man Bad, We're Fucked. We'd be here regardless of who was in office. Hillary, Bernie, likely similar spot. We'd still be trying to tell Biden what Coronavirus is at this point."

 Enquanto parte dos governos estendeu as quarentenas, a redução no contágio faz crescer a discussão sobre como retomar a atividade, paralisada há quase um mês na Itália e há três semanas na maioria dos outros países.

 Na Áustria, o governo afirmou que os números diários de novos casos e de internados em UTIs se reduziram significativamente nos últimos dias, e houve mais recuperados que diagnosticados: entre sábado e domingo, o país registrou 240 novos contágios, e 491 pessoas receberam alta.

 Apesar de os números darem indícios de melhora, o ministro da Saúde austríaco, Rudolf Anschober, pediu que as pessoas mantenham as medidas de isolamento: “Nada de viagens de feriado e celebrações de Páscoa""..

 O chanceler (equivalente a primeiro-ministro) da Áustria, Sebastian Kurz, deve apresentar nesta segunda um primeiro projeto de retomada das atividades, indicando quando, em que ordem e em que condições as restrições serão retiradas.

  “Se todos mantivermos a disciplina durante a Páscoa, etou confiante de que poderemos começar a voltar gradualmente e cautelosamente à normalidade”, disse Kurz ao jornal Kleine Zeitung. O país tem 11.934 casos e 204 mortes.

 A Espanha também divulgou o menor crescimento de mortes diárias em nove dias: 674 em 24 horas, elevando o total para 12.418. O número de novas infecções subiu 5%, também a menor taxa de crescimento desde o começo da crise.

 [A Espanha tem neste domingo 130.759 infectados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/espanha-passa-italia-em-casos-de-coronavirus-e-ambos-reduzem-mortes.shtml), o segundo maior no mundo, atrás dos EUA. O país entrou em quarentena em 15 de março, 11 dias depois da primeira morte.

 Apesar da queda nos novos registros, ainda há hospitais com capacidade de atendimento esgotada, e o governo espanhol renovou as medidas de isolamento até 25 de abril.

 Na Bélgica, o número diário de internações em UTIs teve neste domingo sua maior redução: houve 16 novos pacientes internados, o menor número desde 20 de março, quando começaram os registros oficiais.

 Em quarentena desde o dia 17 de março, seis dias depois da primeira morte, a [Bélgica não enfrentou colapso nos hospitais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/menina-belga-de-12-anos-e-mais-jovem-vitima-do-coronavirus-na-europa.shtml) nesta pandemia. A ocupação dos leitos para cuidados intensivos se manteve em cerca de 50% na última semana, com 1.261 casos graves de Covid-19.

 Na [Itália](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/italia-passa-de-100000-infectados-por-coronavirus.shtml), que completa um mês de quarentena na próxima quinta (9), também caiu o número diário de internações em hospitais em UTI. De 1.276 novas entradas diárias em hospitais e 120 novos casos em UTI em 23 de março, passou a 201 internações diárias e 15 casos em UTI na sexta (3).

 A desaceleração acontece também em países que [têm intensificado o número de testes (o que aumenta o número de confirmações), como a Alemanha](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/coronavirus-por-que-a-alemanha-tem-uma-taxa-de-mortalidade-tao-baixa.shtml), que registrou números menores de novos casos em três dias seguidos.

 Do sábado para domingo, foram 5.936 casos confirmados, elevando o total para 91.714, quarto maior número no mundo. Na véspera, o número de casos havia subido 6.082, e, de quinta para sexta, 6.174. O número de mortes nas últimas 24 horas subiu para 184, depois de vários dias estacionado em 140. São 1.474 mortos até agora, nono maior número global

 Neste final de semana, a Alemanha atingiu a capacidade de testar 100 mil pessoas por dia, segundo o instituto de controle de doenças Robert-Koch Institute, um crescimento de 14 vezes em relação ao começo de março. No total, já foram feitos 1,5 milhão de exames para detectar infectados.

 Os alemães preparam agora um novo programa intensivo de testes, este para descobrir quem desenvolveu anticorpos contra o coronavírus —o que acontece quando o corpo entra em contato com o patógeno e reage à infecção, derrotando-a.

 O Centro Helmhotz de Pesquisa de Infecções (HZI) vai coordenar um estudo com 100 mil participantes, para detectar a presença dos anticorpos.

 Em tese, um resultado positivo poderia significar imunidade. “Indivíduos imunes poderiam ter um certificado semelhante ao de vacinação, que os isentasse de restrições em algumas atividades, afirmou o coordenador do estudo, Gérard Krause.

 É essa uma das estratégias também do Reino Unido, que vem estudando a ideia de um [“passaporte de imunidade”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/04/contra-coronavirus-guedes-defende-passaporte-de-imunidade-para-retomada-da-economia.shtml), segundo o secretário da Saúde, Matthew Hancock. O país negocia 17,5 milhões testes de anticorpos e tem planos para submeter um quarto da população a eles em meados deste mês.

 A ideia é arriscada, segundo cientistas, porque ainda não se sabe com certeza se quem se curou da doença desenvolveu imunidade duradoura. “Certificados de imunidade podem dar uma falsa segurança, que leve as pessoas a reduzirem cuidados indispensáveis”, escreveu a professora de imunologia da Universidade de Edimburgo, Eleanor Riley, no jornal britânico Guardian.

 Se depender desses ""passaportes"", a volta ao normal dos britânicos vai atrasar: nenhum dos nove diferentes tipos de kits de teste recebeu aprovação até este final de semana.

 Além disso, o Reino Unido entrou em quarentena apenas duas semanas depois de registrada a primeira morte: em 21 de março foram fechados bares e restaurantes, no dia 23, suspensas as aulas e apenas no dia 24 houve ordem para que saídas de casa fosem evitadas.

 Embora tenha divulgado um número positivo neste final de semana —o pico esperado para internações em UTI caiu de 30 mil leitos com equipamento de respiração para 18 mil—, ainda há aceleração no número de casos, que chegou a 47.806. Os mortos são 4.934.

 O pouco tempo de quarentena não impede uma pressão crescente por um “mapa da retomada” no Reino Unido. Recém-escolhido [líder do Partido Trabalhista, Keir Starmer](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/04/em-derrota-para-esquerda-centrista-e-eleito-lider-dos-trabalhistas-no-reino-unido.shtml) pediu um plano púlbico em entrevista à rede de TV BBC: “O governo precisa publicar a estratégia de saída do lockdown. O público quer saber quando isso vai terminar”.

 A oposição se soma a vozes dentro do próprio governo, como Rishi Sunak, o equivalente ao ministro das Finanças no Reino Unido.

 Segundo o Sunday Times, Sunak tem pedido que a pasta da Saúde comece a discutir um cronograma para a retomada da atividade econômica, algo que ainda não é possível do ponto de vista técnico, segundo um dos principais conselheiros do governo, o epidemiologista Neil Ferguson, do Imperial College.

 A volta ao normal não será simples, como mostra preocupação recente do governo da Eslováquia, primeiro país europeu a reabrir parte das lojas, em 28 de março, [quando não registrava nenhuma morte por Covid-19](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/03/sem-nenhuma-morte-eslovaquia-comeca-a-reabrir-lojas.shtml).

 A Eslováquia adotou confinamento total no dia 12 de março, quando apenas dez pessoas haviam contraído o coronavírus. Foram proibidas viagens, e as fronteiras ficaram abertas apenas para residentes no país. Todos os eventos culturais, esportivos e religiosos foram suspensos, assim como partidas esportivas. O governo eslovaco também proibiu visitas a hospitais e casas de idosos e suspendeu aulas em todas as escolas.

 Na última quinta (2), após o registro do primeiro caso fatal no país, o premiê Igor Matovic voltou a cogitar um fechamento mais rigoroso, mas o recuo não tem apoio da oposição.

 Na Dinamarca, [outro país que mencionou publicamente como retomar as atividades](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/03/dinamarca-e-2o-pais-a-anunciar-relaxamento-de-medidas-contra-coronavirus.shtml.), a primeira-ministra Mette Frederiksen alertou que, quando ela acontecer, será “gradual, suave e controlada"".

 O país escandinavo foi um dos primeiros a reagir depois que a Itália decretou quarentena, em 9 de março. Dois dias depois, o governo dinamarquês proibiu viagens entre seu país e a Itália, e no dia 14 fechou as fronteiras para todos os não residentes.

 Também fechou bares, restaurantes, lojas e suspendeu as aulas em todas as escolas.

 Em entrevista em 30 de março, quando havia 2.577 casos confirmados e 77 mortes no país nórdico, Mette disse que reavaliaria as medidas de restrição depois da Páscoa. Neste domingo, o país registra 4.369 casos e 179 mortes.​"

I have 40 years experience as a medical professional (I'd rather not disclose more specifics here) and I too was very skeptical for a good 20 years about the level of expertise of physician extenders and was very wary of allowing them too much responsibility. My opinion has changed on that, not least of all due to the extreme pressure MDs and ODs have been under by hospitals and 3rd party payers, which has undermined them and caused their medical work to be less than thorough due to time constraints and the need for excessive and poorly designed documentation. And now, of course, it is a time of crisis, and we need all hands on deck. We are going to lose physicians rapidly, unless those who have already contracted coronavirus (and are thus immune) comprise a larger number than is evident now."
