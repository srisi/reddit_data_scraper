Like i get it.  This all has a learning curve.  But there seems to be a lot of flip flop with all the information.

One of the reviews on amazon says that you only need to change the filters ""once every few months"", but this is for industrial work such as painting. Does anybody know how often is ideal to change them for this virus?

But remember it never had to turn out like this if the government acted sooner and information was allowed to be shared. They're still responsible for this. They essentially gave a known outbreak practically an entire month to spread and they still misrepresent the data to the rest of the world. We have to rely on that data and the CCP is still not willing to give it to us. It would see the rest of the world burn before doing what is right. They will even give officials preferential treatment over sick medical staff. The doctors are overworked inadequately protected, many are sick and dead, and others are still being punished for ""rumormongering.""

&#x200B;

 By definition, aerosols are suspensions in air (or in a gas) of solid or liquid particles, small enough that they remain airborne for prolonged periods because of their low settling velocity. For spherical particles of unit density, settling times (for a 3-m fall) for specific diameters are 10 s for 100 μm, 4 min for 20 μm, 17 min for 10 μm, and 62 min for 5 μm; particles with a diameter <3 μm essentially do not settle. 

here is the link

&#x200B;

And the water in small droplets of the tiny aerosol can evaporate very quickly. And if virus nuclei can survive for a long period of time in the air, someone might inhale the virus nuclei before they die and get infected.

&#x200B;

So, all aerosol =/= airborne.

I don't think people realize how badly everything is faked there, even if it is obvious. They still do it.  There's no concept of being caught in the future, they just do it and deal with it later. It's a terrible mentality.

Heck, there was a Chinese official blatantly lying by saying ""Chinese people enjoy freedom of speech, look at then having lively discussions on social media."" No crap, that's because there are so many people discussing it that the censorship can no longer keep up.

Some other examples I've seen include scammers I have met while in China. Trying to get me to get on a taxi for 120RMB per person when I was aware and told him it should cost no more than 20RMB for the whole group because we've taken taxis before. China claims to be leading the world with green energy when it built fake wind turbines that were actually giant fans using energy to spin and give the illusion they were wind turbines instead of generating energy; they broke down and were never repaired. China even recently lied about its coronavirus hospital. People were watching it on livestream when Chinese media published something that used stock photos from online claiming the hospital was done with people watching the stream could literally verify the fake news, as the photos did not even resemble the actual thing.

They just do it. 能骗就骗  is a very pervasive attitude in the mainland. It's very foreign and strange to westerners because it doesn't make sense. But that's just how it is. They don't think of the consequences because if they can get away with it, they benefit. If there's a problem, just ignore it.

That's because of the way laws are essentially never enforced consistently. People know they can get away if they break certain laws unless there are certain cues telling them the law will be enforced, like if an official is announcing his visit to the city. You can drive your illegal motorcycle for 10 years, put it away for that one week the official is there, then ride it again when he is gone. You can hire prostitutes with your buddies every few days after eating dinner even if there are police officers watching you chatting with a streetwalker. Enforcement is sporadic unlike law here in the USA."

The hard truth is that they are probably gambling with this info in order to keep from spooking the markets so they dont take a huge shit.

* World health
* Country health
* Commonwealth/State health
* County/parish health

The WHO is a health organization, but because they are a globally-focused group, their intentions are much more mired in bureaucracy, red tape, political infighting, money, and straight up global neoliberal political systems. They're primarily concerned with keeping the world's economy afloat, keeping the panic to a minimum, and moving to contain the illness at the behest of its members. It's a very large, slow-moving, lumbering elephant, and while it is effective at its job, it is coated in layers of administration. They have to deal with keeping relationships open between multiple governing bodies, the media, the larger business groups, think tanks, lobbyists...you name it. They don't really care about people. They don't care about ""us"" as much as they care about the system.

The CDC is strictly focused on the United States and US-backed interests. While there is definitely layer upon layer of the same things as the above, the organization is more focused on keeping the federal-level entities, including the economy, the government, the military, and larger businesses, running smoothly while minimizing damage. They  don't really care about people as much as they do with keeping the economy moving, supplies moving, and the coordination of information between state departments of health. They'll also be trying to keep congress/the senate/the supreme court/the president healthy.

Your state department of health and state surgeon general are focused on the state and the neighboring ones. It is primarily concerned with the health of the people in the counties under its control, as well as larger businesses in your state, lobbyists, corporate interests, and law enforcement. They are more concerned with your health, but are also concerned with the local economy and governing apparatuses.

Your county health department is focused on local-level health and disease control. They have the interests of town-level and city-level businesses, but are also beholden to local government organizations (mayors, town councils, and selectmen). They care about your health the most because your health has the most impact on the things within their sphere of control.

It's sort of the same thing with the UN. They don't care about car break-ins in your city or town. Their focus is global and largely economic. They do have ""soldiers"" but they're more of a peacekeeping force, and they're very hard to deploy because of the bureaucracy involved. The FBI wouldn't care about your car, either. Your state might, but not really. Your local police though? Sure. That's because Sergent Rachel lives next door with her husband and two kids. She has to care because your car break-in today might be her break-in tomorrow.

***So to summarize, the WHO doesn't give two steamy-creamies in a truck stop bathroom about me, you, or your family. Neither does the CDC really. The people who kind of care about you are on the local level. The people who really care about you are your local officials and your community.***"

For most people.

You don't work? You don't get paid. And before you say, ""those damn greedy companies!"" understand that they also have no customers which means they have no cash flow. Which means they can't pay even if they wanted to. Sure the massive corporations like a Walmart might be able to pay but even they have limits. No company has the huge cash reserves necessary to pay people who aren't working for weeks or more.

Will the government tell the city water works and electric companies to keep that stuff flowing even though no one is paying? Yes. Otherwise you'll really have panic and riots.

But the other stuff?

The food will be the most difficult thing for the government and the people to deal with. The government will probably try to seize all food so it can ration it out.

Honestly I'm worried about this outbreak. Going to buy some food grade buckets and some rice to store in it. Extra canned food. While it's cheap. If I don't need it I can still use it over time.

Just want to vent a bit my thoughts,

It""s  getting more and more difficult to believe any happy ending of the  epidemic. There are now too much indicator to me that this is going to  go full global catastrophic. Here is how i process :

\-It  already happened 100 years ago, when the world was less connected and  less populated. An H1N1 strain killed 5% of the world population then  mutated in less lethal form maybe to survive because of lack of living  host. It killed mostly healthy and young men.

\-An official 2 % mortality rate is already really high.

\-Chinese  government are know for covering everything that don't suit them.  Provinces are quarantined, hospitals are crowded, sick people have  nowhere to go and dies at home, army is deployed and some internet  source says lot of dead bodies are burned and erased from statistics. 2%  or 700 dead at this time seems really a small odd number to me.

\-It  is heavily contagious.  Like if someone have it and just take an  elevator, the next people will have it. If someone have it and cough,  the infectious airborne droplets will evaporate only to left a  crystallized viral particle that can travel in the dry air for hours.  This is plague level contagiousness.

\-TV  News are not or little talking about it. Strange. Usually they always  seeks for selling you fear, and they have a potential deadly virus with  evil Chinese coverup, they just have to pick one of those Chinese video  on social medias. But not this time. Why ? Do they know something we  shouldn't ? Is the goal is to prevent panic in population ? Have they  guidelines from governments ? This make me think something big is  hidden.

\-People around me are  unaware of the situation. Like very unaware. My lovely gf is a nurse,  but she get annoyed every time i talk about the CoronaVirus. Like it is  just one more flu to her, and it can't hit us because life is always  more easy to us Europeans. I had to explain to her why 50 millions  people in quarantine is concerning. She now understand and play the  game.  I struggle to find in real humans how feel concerned. I stocked  some food and water in case things go bad.

\-People  in my country do not have the discipline of Chinese people. Here, citizen are king. I don't want to see what a quarantined city will look  like here. I still hope Im wrong and all will be ok soon."

They are not remotely concerned with the threat of invasion. China is far more concerned with losing legitimacy from an incompetent response and the existential threat that an economic collapse would pose to the CCP's grip on power.

There is an unspoken tradeoff in China. The CCP maintains its power due to the rapid growth China has managed for the past 2 decades as well as its perceived efficiency in dealing with problems. This centralized power and efficiency come at the cost of human rights, freedom of speech, of the press, etc. So far it has been a bargain worth making for the Chinese people.

What happens though if growth comes to a halt and a virus sweeps across the country killing millions while party cadres steal masks and supplies and provide little in the way of assistance? The tradeoff looks markedly less appealing."

I also read a paper a few days ago that said MS patients were more likely to have antibodies to the common cold-causing coronaviruses than people who didn't have MS.

Human evolution, we have a natural fight or flight. If it’s in your mind that 90% of the world is going to get this, there is nothing for you to fight. Now it’s fear and flight.

I fainted while driving and was taken to hospital in an ambulance. I was unconscious all day. I am a single parent with kids aged 10 and 12 at that time. I had no support. I had to go home. The hospital didn't want to let me go and I had to sign a form that I understood that. I'd say that fell into the 15% severe level. I couldn't drive. I was barely conscious but I couldn't leave young kids alone.  


From the net: It is estimated that the **flu** results in 31.4 million outpatient visits and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year. During the severe 2017-**2018 flu** season , one of the longest in recent years, estimates indicate that more than 900,000 people were hospitalized and more than 80,000 people died from **flu (USA numbers)**  
Thus 200k hospitalisations from a population of 330million is .06% for regular flu and 0.27% for 2017/8 flu season.  


We are talking about an infection rate of 2% according to Chinese figures but western scientists think it is 10x so 20% infection rate. Of that 3% are likely to be critical and die if no/inadquate medical attention. 

Population of USA 330million means 1,980,000 Americans could die.  
Population of China 1.4billion means 8,400,000 Chinese will die.  
Population of India which has less medical facilities 1.3billion means 7,800,000 plus are likely to die."

2020-02-08,chrissseyy,Coronavirus,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f0zwml/who_has_asked_for_censorship/fh1sjsw/,"Look up Dr John Campbell’s videos. They reconstructed the genome of the virus (the one China sent) and said that the virus is asymptomatic. A lot of independent scientists and doctors were also saying it is asymptomatic.

Dr Campbell proved this to be true. He read the 1st death report outside of China, the man who died in the Philippines. The virus was found in the feces samples and “breath”. 

See, this is why I want slap everyone at WHO. They keep saying it’s droplets droplets. No, it’s airborne also. How else can an asymptomatic person spread without coughing or sneezing? Touching the same surface as the infected person? Probably but unlikely.

I mean I’m just piecing the puzzles together. Respiratory virus that attacks the lungs and causes death pneumonia, check. So the chances of it being found by the exhalation of breath is very likely, without a doubt. It doesn’t incubate in the throat, it’s in the lungs.

What WHO is trying to do is suppress the idea that it’s airborne. And they’re comparing it to something like “Of course cancer in the balls can’t be found in the breath”."

If it's equally as bad as a the flu then it's an additive problem to society. 

Think of how many people that *don't* die from the flu and it still sucks. All that emotional and physical drain from feeling like garbage for many days, and the economic loss on both an individual and societal level. What doesn't kill you might set you back pretty hard still.

The best way and that which has been verified in a 2007 study in the  December issue of the *Journal of Environmental Health* is to lightly wet them then place them in a microwave oven.  Between 2 and 4 minutes will annihilate any bacteria or viruses.  The heating action from the vibration of water molecules combined with the same being done to various bonds in the viral and bacterial protein coats destroys them.  

There is a metal tab on the N95.  You can remove it and reglue after sterilization or you can just take a chance.  It will reflect back into your magnetron.  If it starts to arc then just remove it.

With this method, you can reuse your mask safely until it becomes so clogged you can't breathe through it, or the straps break."

BY DEFINITION, Droplets and Aeresolized are BOTH forms of AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION

**Definition of airborne pathogen via ANY medical dictionary.**

""Airborne Pathogen -  any disease-causing organism which can be transmitted through the air."" (PERIOD)

Aeresolized Falls under the classification of airborne.

The virus is and has been airborne like EVERY OTHER COV including the common cold.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

"" An **airborne disease** is any disease that is caused by [pathogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) that can be transmitted through the air. ""

"" Airborne disease is transmitted as both small, dry particles, **and** as larger liquid droplets.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_disease#cite_note-4) ""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne\_disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_disease)

**Per your same NIOSH study**"" ‘Aerosols’ would also include ‘droplet nuclei’ which are small particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less, **typically produced through the process of rapid desiccation of exhaled respiratory droplets** \[[5](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3707-y#ref-CR5), [6](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3707-y#ref-CR6)\]. However, in some situations, such as where there are strong ambient air cross-flows, for example, l**arger droplets can behave like aerosols** with the potential to transmit infection via this route (see next section below). ""

and"" Several authors lump together transmission by **either large droplets or aerosol-sized particles as “airborne transmission**” ""

Note they state "" However, **we think** that it is important to maintain a distinction between particles of < 10 μm and larger particles ""

You present a paper that states it might be a good idea to have a distinction of types of airborne transmission as being THE DEFINITION of airborne, without either reading or noting that this is a suggestion and NOT THE STANDARD DEFINITION ACCEPTED BY THE ENTIRE WORLD currently (since you like to shout, Ill meet you in your world)

NOW how this relates to the current outbreak:nCoV is being considered as extremely similar to SARS albeit more transmissible and showing faster spread (wonder why)

YOUR paper even notes that "" For SARS-CoV, several thorough epidemiological studies that include retrospective airflow tracer investigations are **consistent with the hypothesis of an airborne transmission route** "" Even under its Not universally accepted definition of airborne.

So. I present several standards used the world over noting that droplets are considered airborn YOU present a paper that asks if maybe we should reclassify this world standard as being the world standard.

Every agency is responding to nCoV as an airborne disease, Every other Coronavirus studied is considered Airborne, This Corona Virus is spread through the air and thus is Airborne.  


"" isolate the [PUI for 2019-nCoV](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html) in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR), if available.""

Your constant DENIALISM and attempts to down play this are dangerous as they cause people to under prepare and not take proper precautions and thus potentially SPREAD THE DISEASE FURTHER.

YOU will be responsible for the Dead should this spread to those who read your dangerous posts and don't take proper precautions.

1) there's a fucking vaccine for it (and though it might not work due to differences in strains, it's at least a preemptive measure people can take)  

2) does the flu spread this fast?  

3)  has the flu shut down airports and cities?

4)  has the flu prompted makeshift hospitals and quarantine zones?

5)  according to the CDC, there have been **22 million flu diagnoses** this season, and among those, 12,000 deaths.  it would appear - i'm no mathematician, so feel free to correct me - that CV is far outpacing the flu when it comes to mortality.  even based on what we know are probably bullshit numbers.

btw, when i look at the following map, and the note about ""elevated levels for 13 weeks"", i wonder exactly how many of these flu cases have been misdiagnosed, though i prefer not to wonder for long:

One could say we’re both wrong and right at the same time depending on droplet size and whether it’s still contagious once aerosolized, but it’s fair to say that, being cautious, anyone in a high risk environment should be wearing an N95 mask. Otherwise, regular contact/droplet protection surgical type masks should still offer significant protection. Good luck quantifying that risk differential, but in general, I don’t see a need for everyone to walk around wearing an N95 in public - yet?  

[This super-nerdy CDC guy with a tactical quarantine vest on ](https://www.kcra.com/article/5-quarantined-travis-afb-show-symptoms-of-coronavirus-cdc-says/30817842) says no need for masks in public in the US, and standing 6’ away is all that’s needed to avoid transmission. I would be more cautious than that, as other coronavirus was have been shown to remain viable on surfaces for weeks!

In my opinion, anyone who either knows they have, or can’t afford to catch a respiratory infection should be wearing a regular mask in public anyway. Germ etiquette is sorely lacking in the US, regardless of 2019-nCoV prevalence. I’d say N95’s for *everyone* if it really starts to spread in your area."

Yes, some people will view content like this and begin to panic, and that cannot be helped. However those who do not panic and take information such as this at face value and prepare for what is likely now an inevitability, will be far more likely to get thru what is to come.

- how people around the world are handling things

I've even gone to a shooting range or out in the desert every week or two to hone my various combat and survival skills because that's just who I am. And shooting guns is fun, but that's another thing. I'm only in my late 20's but I realized many years ago that our society is incredibly fragile and even moderate disruptions to things like supply lines spell disaster for my country, and humanity. When shit hits the fan, it really hits the fan, so I've prepared mentally and physically for all the possible things that come with that.

Take a break from the virus news for a few days - you're 16, and if this whole thing blows over, you'll be kicking yourself for wasting hours on ends for days/weeks/months when you could have been doing something more productive and worthwhile. Get all your virus updates from an official government website - I guess that would be CDC for you. Don't engage in social media. 

2. If you're super worried, and you have some spare cash - maybe start buying some prep items like hand sanitizers, canned fruit/veggies, water, masks (if possible), gloves, vitamins, cold/flu meds (not for the virus itself but for other sickness), some painkillers etc. here and there. Don't tell your family about it, and just keep it in your room. If this whole thing blows over, you can just donate it to some charity and if it doesn't, well then your family will be pleased to know you have done some prepping. 

3. If you are diagnosed with anxiety, talk to a health professional and see if maybe you need to be medicated or seek some sort of treatment. Anxiety is helluva mental disease and it can spiral out of control very quickly (source: me). Couple that with paranoia, your body will NOT have a good time."

Few hot takes

The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were depressed total lymphocytes, prolonged pro- thrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Com- pared with non-ICU patients, patients who received ICU care had numerous laboratory abnormalities. These abnormali- ties suggest that 2019-nCoV infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocar- dia injury, hepatic injury, and kidney injury. These laboratory abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in pa- tients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection.

The dynamic profile of laboratory findings was tracked in 33 patients with NCIP (5 nonsurvivors and 28 survivors). In the nonsurvivors, the neutrophil count, D-dimer, blood urea, and creatinine levels continued to increase, and the lymphocyte counts continued to decrease until death occurred. Neutro- philia may be related to cytokine storm induced by virus in- vasion, coagulation activation could have been related to sus- tained inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury could have been related to direct effects of the virus, hypoxia, and shock. The 3 pathologic mechanisms may be associated with the death of patients with NCIP.

Until now, no specific treatment has been recommended for coronavirus infection except for meticulous supportive care.17 Currently, the approach to this disease is to control the source of infection; use of personal protection precaution to reduce the risk of transmission; and early diagnosis, isolation, and supportive treatments for affected patients. Antibacterial agents are ineffective. In addition, no anti- viral agents have been found to provide benefit for treating SARS and MERS. All of the patients in this study received antibacterial agents, 90% received antiviral therapy, and 45% received methylprednisolone. The dose of oseltamivir and methylprednisolone varied depending on disease severity. However, no effective outcomes were observed.

This study has several limitations."

-When China quarenteened 50 mil people, their own gov was telling them flu is worse
-When China told everyones to wear masks, their own gov told them masks are useless
-When China first was told everyones there is asympotmatic transmission, their own gov told them theres no evidence
-When China first told everyones the virus can survive for days on surfaces, their own gov said you cant catch from public places
-When China is testing 6000 samples a day, their own gov tell them the ""world best"" healthcare system can only process 5 a day
-When China quarenteens everyones sharing a bus with a suspected patent, their own gov was letting entire cruise ship of people go before results gmcome back

They're not exactly independent variables either.

More cases -> better awareness -> less freakin' handshaking, perhaps a bit more hygiene -> a bit less spread

More cases -> more spread, harder to track/isolate

More cases -> more in need of care -> less care available -> average quality of care per case lower -> increased mortality

And they count the 200 pneumonia patients that are escorted out by van as confirmed cases and not deaths, even if they plan on killing them (which I'm not saying they are) or the patients die at home or in quarantine or on the way somewhere..  
The actual number of deaths could be 260 per day in this example..

An airborne disease is any disease that is caused by pathogens that can be transmitted through the air. Such diseases include many of considerable importance both in human and veterinary medicine. The relevant pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, toilet flushing or any activities which generates aerosol particles or droplets. Human airborne diseases do not include conditions caused by air pollution such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), gases and any airborne particles.

One could surmise that they're being quarantined, or cremated. If they die outside of the hospital, they die without confirmation.

The sudden death percentage is more like 30%, not 5-10%. 

I think."
