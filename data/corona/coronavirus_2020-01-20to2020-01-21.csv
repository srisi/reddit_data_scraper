In the USA as well as in Asian neighboring countries of China, there are now fever controls at airports for travelers from Wuhan. The wave of travel to the Chinese New Year next Saturday has already begun in China. It is the largest annual migration of peoples, hundreds of millions of Chinese are on the move at this time. This increases the risk of transmission of infectious diseases.

Coronaviruses often cause harmless diseases such as colds. But they also cause dangerous respiratory diseases such as sars and mers. Experts believe that the new pathogen is similar to sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). Almost 800 people died of lung disease more than 15 years ago"

Take a look at the SARS scare, where they hid critical info until Feb 2003.
This [article](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/) suggests that the scale is worse, around 1700 cases.
Either way, this is spreading fast, people are not treating it as a potential epidemic (or worse). If fit people (like the man in the article) can be brought to the brink of death, older people and people in an altered state of health are sureley in for a ride.
Hopefully, we've learned something from the SARS outbreak, although I'm skeptical."

The problem is that not only is this a coronavirus but it has already been analyzed and found to be closer to SARS than to the common cold.

The problem is that this can easily become widespread and when it mutates THEN there could be a major problem.

> The patients are in stable condition and their close contacts have been placed under medical observation, said Zhejiang province's health commission.

> In Wuhan, the local health commission said 136 new cases were found over the weekend, without giving details about the person who died.

> Among the new cases in the city, 66 are male and 70 are female, ranging in age between 25 and 89 years old. Their symptoms included fever, coughing or tightness of the chest and breathing difficulties, a statement from the health commission said.

> No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan's health commission has previously said the possibility 'cannot be excluded' AFP/STR

> More than 200 people have now been diagnosed with the virus across China.

> Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper published Friday that the number of cases in the city was likely to be closer to 1,700, much higher than the number officially identified.

> Due to China's efforts to implement broader screening, new cases may be identified in the coming days and weeks, it added.

> Wuhan, a city of 11 million inhabitants that serve as a major transport hub, will strengthen oversight of big events and reduce the number of public gatherings, state media quoted Chen Yanxin, the city's deputy mayor as saying on Sunday.

> Wuhan deputy mayor Chen Xiexin said on state broadcaster CCTV at the weekend that infrared thermometers had been installed at airports, railway stations and coach stations across the city.

> Chen said passengers with fevers were being registered, given masks and taken to medical institutions. Nearly 300,000 body temperature tests had been carried out, according to CCTV.

> Authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers from the Chinese mainland.

> Airport authorities in Singapore, the United States as well as most Asian nations are also screening passengers from Wuhan.

The issue is, it's also cold and flu season. Hell I even know a healthy expat who had ""regular"" pneumonia here in October. So this time of year they usually have people coming in for respiratory illnesses, and now they have to figure out if they're this new Coronavirus.

Currently though, like with any virus like this, if you're healthy, you shows respond to treatment. So far the people who have passed away were elderly with underlying complications.

It's not Ebola, and it's not like the film Contagion.

Face masks and good hygiene will keep this at bay for most of the population.

Just for context, according to the British Lung Foundation, pneumonia kills around 30,000 British people a year. Regular pneumonia. And no one panics over that.

We are a long way from locking down cities and towns, but it doesn't hurt to be more mindful of food hygiene practices."

A major failing of the SARS outbreak was lack of communication on the progress and necessary precautions, and so far it *seems* like matters are being handled properly. We know a likely origin, we know who the early cases are, and cases in new provinces seem to be reported in a timely manner.

If this is anything like similar coronavirus outbreaks, vulnerability scales with age, so the older you are (or are close to) the more cautious you need to be.

This has been discussed before, but the basic steps I'd take ratchet up as the risk does. Start with better hand washing and avoiding sick people. Bump up to an N95 mask, call in sick (shouldn't be hard to do) if you can't work from home in your normal job. 

Figure out places you go where it's easy to get sick. Grocery stores, schools, hospitals, office environments. Avoid them or try to practice really good personal protection in them."

The good news is that viruses tend to mutate in a way that makes them less, not more, lethal. As if they are too lethal they also won't survive as they'll have killed off their hosts. 

What you don't want is a virus that is just lethal enough, like say, the Spanish Flu of 1918. That one killed of 10-20% of the infected population, or 3-6% of the total global population (50 million people). 
Whereas currently seasonal flu kills between 291,000 to 646,000 people annually.  Those are all examples of ""just lethal enough."" 

This novel coronavirus (nCov) right now is at 3% lethality, which sounds better than SARS, MERS, and Ebola, and the Spanish flu of 1918 had 10-20% lethality. Assuming this nCov spread to everyone and everyone was affected, 3-to-6% of today's population would be 234 Million, about or less than today's seasonal flu rates.

What we don't know yet: does this nCov's lethality affect old, susceptible people like seasonal flu generally does? Or does it kill young, healthy people in higher proportions, like the 1918 flu? 

Tl;DR: get your annual flu shot, not just for you, but to protect the fragile around you."

**Article**:

> BEIJING (AP) — China reported Monday a sharp rise in the number of people infected with a new coronavirus, including the first cases in the capital. The outbreak coincides with the country’s busiest travel period, as millions board trains and planes for the Lunar New Year holidays.

> Health authorities in the central city of Wuhan, where the viral pneumonia appears to have originated, said an additional 136 cases have been confirmed in the city, which now has a total of 198 infected patients. As of the weekend, a third patient had died, bringing the death toll to three.

> Two individuals in Beijing and one in the southern city of Shenzhen have also been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, health commissions in the respective cities said Monday. The three people had visited Wuhan.

> The outbreak has put other countries on alert as millions of Chinese travel for Lunar New Year. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China.

> At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three U.S. airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China. 

> Many of the initial cases had connections to a seafood market in Wuhan, which was closed for an investigation. As hundreds of people who came into close contact with diagnosed patients were not infected themselves, the municipal health commission maintains that the virus is not easily transmitted between humans, though it has not ruled out limited human-to-human transmission.

> China’s National Health Commission said experts have judged the current outbreak to be “preventable and controllable.”

> “However, the source of the new type of coronavirus has not been found, we do not fully understand how the virus is transmitted, and changes in the virus still need to be closely monitored,” the commission said in a Sunday statement.

> Coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from the common cold to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS first infected people in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800.

> The virus causing the current outbreak is different from those previously identified, Chinese scientists said earlier this month. Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath.

> On the Weibo social media platform, which is widely used in China, people posted prevention advice such as wearing masks and washing hands. State broadcaster CCTV recommended staying warm, increasing physical activity, eating lightly and avoiding crowded places.

And, it's ""expected""... we have ways of dealing with the flu.  It's like Car crashes.  Crashes don't alarm people, because people die from car crashes every year... it's expected, and we know all of the sudden a billion people aren't going to die from car crashes one year.

If you remember ""SARS"" from a decade or so ago, that killed 800+ people, and often kills healthy people(that was a coronavirus).

The reason it's such a big deal is because if it for instance hits Bejing(which it already has), it could spread to hundreds of people in a few days time, and many thousands in a few weeks.  Very quickly, it can turn from ""just two people"" to millions.

Plus, viruses can quickly mutate.  Right now it's not that deadly of a virus(not as bad as SARS).  But, tommorow, it could mutate, and have 50% mortality rate, and still be spreading to millions of people, at which point it could become a serious epidemic, where many thousands die.

Of course, this isn't likely.  But, it's really only a matter of time before some kind of serious viral epidemic happens... and as humans we have very little way to combat viruses.  All we can do is try to keep it from spreading, and HOPE it doesn't evolve into a form that's too hard for our immune systems to deal with.

China is basically the worst case scenario, because they have so many people packed in there, that it's basically a breeding ground for viruses, and the more people it can infect, the more chance that it mutates into something more deadly."

> SINGAPORE — Singapore’s seventh suspected case of a new coronavirus originating from the Chinese city of Wuhan has been admitted for further assessment and isolated as a precautionary measure here, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (20 January).

> In a press statement, the ministry said that it was notified of a 44-year-old female Singapore resident with pneumonia, who had travelled to Wuhan, as of 10am on the same day.

> She was admitted for treatment and is in stable condition, the MOH added.

> “The suspect case did not visit the Huanan seafood wholesale market associated with the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan,” said the ministry.

> Separately, epidemiological investigations, clinical assessment, and laboratory test results from a suspect case reported on 18 January concluded that it was not linked to the new coronavirus outbreak.

> The 52-year-old male Singapore resident with pneumonia, who had travelled to Wuhan, tested negative for coronavirus.

> “As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently returned from Wuhan, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan cluster,” said the MOH.

> Earlier on Monday, the ministry announced that it will expand temperature screening at Changi Airport to all travellers on flights arriving from China from Wednesday.

> Since 3 January, temperature screening has only been implemented at the airport for travellers arriving on flights from Wuhan.

> These measures come as Chinese authorities revealed earlier on Monday that 136 new cases of pneumonia caused by the coronavirus strain were found in Wuhan over the weekend, adding to 62 already known cases.

> A third death occurred on Saturday, added Chinese authorities.

> South Korea on the same day reported its first confirmed case of the coronavirus, a 35-year-old female Chinese national who had traveled from Wuhan, the fourth patient to be reported outside China. Last week, two cases were reported in Thailand and one in Japan. All three involved people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city.

> According to Reuters, a report by London Imperial College's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis estimated that by 12 January there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan with the onset of related symptoms. 

> The new virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-2003 outbreak and also originated from China.

Después de que el pasado jueves [se detectaran los dos primeros casos en el extranjero](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/16/actualidad/1579160356_375302.html) –en Tailandia y Japón–, este fin de semana las autoridades chinas han confirmado una nueva oleada de infecciones en Wuhan y los primeros tres positivos en otras ciudades del país. También una nueva víctima mortal, [el tercer fallecido hasta la fecha](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/11/actualidad/1578735649_012206.html) a causa de esta extraña dolencia. Corea del Sur, por otro lado, ha confirmado este lunes su primer caso

 El número de infectados se ha disparado en Wuhan, la ciudad en el centro de China que [se considera el origen del brote](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/09/actualidad/1578556344_366873.html). La Comisión Municipal de Sanidad ha informado que una tercera persona falleció el sábado a causa del misterioso virus, el cual provoca síntomas similares a los de una neumonía, ocasionando fiebre y dificultades respiratorias. Su muerte se suma a la de otros dos hombres, de 61 y 69 años respectivamente. Ambos padecían enfermedades pulmonares de antemano y perecieron por las complicaciones derivadas de la infección.

 Las autoridades locales han detallado que se han detectado 136 nuevos positivos –59 el sábado y 77 el domingo–, lo que eleva el número total de casos confirmados hasta la fecha a 198. La Comisión Municipal defendió la semana pasada que no se habían producido nuevos casos desde el 3 de enero, dando a entender que la situación estaba controlada, y que la transmisión entre humanos parecía poco probable, aunque no podía ser descartada por completo.

 La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ha corroborado los últimos datos a través de [su cuenta de Twitter](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1219026530636091392?s=20), aunque los ha atribuido al aumento de información disponible sobre el virus. “Esto [los nuevos casos] es el resultado de una mayor búsqueda y testeo del 2019-nCov [nombre oficial del coronavirus descubierto hace dos semanas] entre los pacientes que sufren enfermedades respiratorias”. “La OMS está proponiendo estudios sobre el nuevo coronavirus que pueden llevarse a cabo en China y en cualquier otro lugar para entender mejor la transmisión, factores de riesgo y el origen del virus. Estos trabajos requerirán tiempo y recursos”, añadía la institución en una publicación posterior.

 Al mismo tiempo, la Comisión Nacional de Salud de China ha revelado la detección de otras tres nuevas infecciones, las primeras en territorio doméstico fuera de Wuhan: dos en la capital Pekín y otra en Shenzhen, población que enfrenta Hong Kong desde suelo continental.

 Pero esto podría no ser todo. Existen rumores, asimismo, de que se habrían identificado varios casos sospechosos en Shanghái. Así lo exponía un doctor de uno de los principales hospitales de la ciudad en declaraciones anónimas al diario hongkonés *South China Morning Post*. “Nuestro centro está llevando a cabo sesiones de entrenamiento sobre prevención y tratamiento del virus. También se están apresurando las compras de máscaras, gorros y desinfectantes”, afirmó. “Siendo sincero, estoy asustado. Es un nuevo virus con muchos aspectos que todavía no están claros”.

 El Centro chino de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades publicó el sábado un comunicado a través de su página web y redes sociales, en el que subrayaba que este nuevo virus “no es el SARS”, una epidemia originada en China y que [acabó con la vida de más de 700 personas](//elpais.com/diario/2003/05/11/sociedad/1052604001_850215.html) por todo el mundo entre 2002 y 2003. El centro también desestimó los “rumores” que apuntan a que centros sanitarios fuera de Wuhan podrían estar ofreciendo en secreto tratamiento a personas infectadas con el virus. El domingo, la Comisión Nacional de Salud china se sumó con un texto en el que llamaba a la calma, caracterizando la situación como “previsible y controlable”, al tiempo que reconocía necesario “un seguimiento de cerca para descubrir nuevas mutaciones”.

 La publicación del centro ha generado más de 5.000 comentarios en Weibo –red social china similar a Twitter–, una mayoría de ellos expresando preocupación ante el desarrollo de los acontecimientos. “¿No han encontrado la fuente de la infección y se atreven a proclamar que la epidemia está bajo control? Cualquiera que tenga un mínimo de conocimientos médicos sabe que lo más grave que puede ocurrir en estas situaciones es que la fuente no esté localizada”, escribía un usuario. Las investigaciones de las autoridades han apuntado desde el primer momento a un mercado de pescado y marisco en Wuhan, donde el virus se habría transmitido de un animal a varias personas. La zona permanece en cuarentena desde hace varias semanas, aunque no se descarta que pueda haber otros focos.

 Otros muchos mensajes alertaban de la proximidad del [año nuevo chino](//elpais.com/tag/ano_nuevo_chino/a), celebración que tendrá lugar el próximo sábado 25 de enero y famosa por constituir [la mayor migración humana del mundo con más de 3.000 millones de desplazamientos](//elpais.com/elpais/2018/02/12/album/1518429270_849260.html). “Las fechas se acercan y Wuhan es un gran nudo de transportes, espero que todo el mundo preste atención para protegerse”, manifestaba otro internauta. Tanto China como el resto de países de la región han comenzado a extremar las medidas de seguridad en aeropuertos y estaciones de tren. Unas imágenes difundidas esta mañana [en redes sociales](https://twitter.com/jsantirso/status/1219124339930329093?s=20) muestran a un equipo de personal médico vistiendo equipos de protección y revisando, uno a uno, la temperatura corporal de los pasajeros de un avión que abandonaba la ciudad de Wuhan.

 Algunos comentarios, asimismo, han reaccionado con escepticismo, desconfiando de la veracidad de las informaciones oficiales. Aunque el Gobierno chino ha mejorado mucho su reacción con respecto a la gestión del SARS, epidemia mantenida en secreto durante semanas, todavía existen dudas razonables sobre la transparencia de los datos: mientras nuevos casos salían a la luz en el extranjero, la cifra de infectados se mantenía, hasta este fin de semana, estable dentro de sus fronteras.

 Un [estudio](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/) reciente elaborado por el Centro de Análisis de Enfermedades Infecciosas Globales del Imperial College de Londres estimaba que, a fecha del 12 de enero, el número de infecciones probables se elevaba a 1.723. “Es probable que el brote de un nuevo coronavirus en Wuhan haya causado una cantidad de enfermedades respiratorias leves o moderadas sustancialmente mayor de la que se ha ofrecido”, rezaba el texto, producido con apoyo de la OMS."

You could use them for initial sanity checks and some comparisons, e.g. blastp. The genome contains pretty much CoV specific stuff only, so you may want to collect CoV's annotated reference sequences and try to look for tools that designed for CoVs instead of generic/human genome tools.

Please keep in mind that the MN908947 is an assembly based on illumina short reads. There might be assembly artifacts if the actually genome harbors significantly long structural variations, and [people has pointed out some quality issues](http://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319) regarding the other Wuhan CoV genomes. These may or may not matter, depends on what exactly you want to look into. IMO I'd prefer aligning illumina reads to existing CoV genomes (some of them were based on sanger sequencing), instead of the assembly, but it seems that the reads are nowhere to be found. Also, according the ncbi page of MN908947, the authors has submitted a paper (unpublished as of Jan 20), there'd be more info available once that's online. 

Disclaimer: I had little experience with virus genomes, the above is to be assumed as generic opinions."

> The health officials said there was no need for such forms on trains, as the temperature checks being done at the West Kowloon terminus - where two trains arrive everyday via Wuhan - are effective enough.

Beijing, the capital, reported two cases, while the southern tech hub of Shenzhen reported one case.
The total number of confirmed cases now exceeds 200, and three have died from the respiratory illness. 
The sharp uptick in those infected comes as millions of Chinese prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year holidays.
Health officials have identified the infection, which first appeared in Wuhan in December, as being a strain of coronavirus. They say it led to an outbreak of viral pneumonia, but much about it remains unknown.
Although the outbreak is believed to have originated from a market, officials and scientists are yet to determine exactly how it has been spreading.
South Korea reported its first confirmed case of the virus on Monday, following two in Thailand and one in Japan. 
The outbreak has revived memories of the Sars virus - also a coronavirus - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across dozens of countries, mostly in Asia. 
Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus.
■   Mystery Chinese virus: How worried should we be? 
■   New Chinese virus 'preventable and controllable'
Experts in the UK told the BBC the number of people infected could still be far greater than official figures suggest, with estimates closer to 1,700. 
What we know about the virus
■   2019-nCoV, as it's been labelled, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans
■   Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people
■   Scientists believe an animal source is ""the most likely primary source"" but that some human-to-human transmission has occurred 
■   Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties
■   People are being advised to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms
Source: World Health Organization 
Who has been infected? 
Authorities in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million that has been at the heart of the outbreak, said 136 new cases had been confirmed over the weekend, with a third person dying of the virus. 
There had previously been only 62 confirmed cases in the city. 
As of late Sunday, officials said 170 people in Wuhan were still being treated in hospital, including nine in critical condition. 
Health officials in Beijing's Daxing district meanwhile said two people who had travelled to Wuhan were treated for pneumonia linked to the virus. 
In Shenzhen, close to Hong Kong, officials said a 66-year-old man showed symptoms of the virus following a trip to visit relatives in Wuhan. Eight others in Shenzhen have been quarantined and are under observation to determine if they have the virus. 
Four cases have been confirmed abroad - all of them involving people from Wuhan or who had visited the city.
In South Korea, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a 35-year-old Chinese woman was suffering from a fever and respiratory problems after travelling there from Wuhan. She was put into isolation and treated at a local hospital. 
The World Health Organization said it was currently not recommending restrictions on travel or trade, but was providing guidance to countries preparing for any outbreak.
Singapore and Hong Kong have been screening air passengers from Wuhan, and US authorities announced similar measures starting on Friday at three major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.
What are the Chinese authorities saying?
China's National Health Commission on Sunday said the virus was ""still preventable and controllable"", while warning that close monitoring was needed given that the source, transmission and mutation methods were unknown.
It said there had been no cases of the virus spreading from one person to another, but that it had instead crossed the species barrier and come from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan.
However the WHO said it believed there had been ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts"".
""As more… cases are identified and more analysis undertaken, we will get a clearer picture of disease severity and transmission patterns,"" it wrote on Twitter. 
It noted that the rise in cases in China was a result of ""increased searching and testing for [the virus] among people sick with respiratory illness"". 
What impact could Lunar New Year have?
From Friday, most Chinese will begin their week-long Lunar New Year holidays.
It's a time when hundreds of millions travel around China to visit family, raising fears that authorities will not be able to adequately monitor further spread of the disease.
Wuhan is a transport hub and authorities there have for nearly a week been using temperature scanners at airports, and train and bus stations. Those showing signs of fever have been registered, given masks and taken to hospitals and clinics.
Authorities say they will now also be screening everyone leaving the city.
At Beijing's central railway station, some travellers donned masks but did not appear overly concerned about the virus.
""Watching the news, I do feel a little worried. But I haven't taken precautionary measures beyond wearing regular masks,"" Li Yang, a 28-year-old account manager travelling to the region of Inner Mongolia, told the AFP news agency. 
But the tone in Chinese social media, where the outbreak has been a top trending topic, was different. 
""Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?"" one Weibo user said."

**An outbreak of pneumonia-like illnesses began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.** 

**Its symptoms are typically a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some patients have developed pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening infection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs.** 

**Scientists in China recognized its similarity to two viruses that turned into global killers: SARS and MERS.** 

**SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by the SARS coronavirus, known as SARS Co, and first emerged in China in 2002.** 

**By the end of the outbreak, the virus had spread to several other Asian countries as well as the UK and Canada, killing 774.** 

**MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, originated in the region for which it's named, ultimately killed 787 people and belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as SARS.** 

**The new virus wasn't a match for either of those two, but it did belong to the same coronavirus family.** 

**Coronaviruses are a large family of pathogens, and most cause mild respiratory infections - i.e. the common cold.** 

**But because the SARS and MERS proved deadly, the emergence of another new coronavirus has health officials on edge around the world.** 

**Like its two dangerous cousins, the new coronavirus appears to have originated with animals - particularly seafood, chickens, bats, and marmots - found at a Wuhan market that's been identified as the epicenter of the outbreak.**  

**The symptoms of SARS, which may be similar to those of the new coronavirus, include:**

* **a high temperature (fever)**
* **extreme tiredness (fatigue)**
* **headaches**
* **chills**
* **muscle pain**
* **loss of appetite**
* **diarrhea**

**After these symptoms, the infection will begin to affect your lungs and airways (respiratory system), leading to additional symptoms, such as:**

* **a dry cough**
* **breathing difficulties**
* **an increasing lack of oxygen in the blood, which can be fatal in the most severe cases**

**So far, there isn't a treatment for the new virus or SARS, though the new virus has been sequenced, allowing for rapid diagnostics.**"

Coronavirus can last for up to a month on exposed surfaces.

I agree, we don't know that this is ""the one"" yet, although WHO is now admitting that there is evidence of limited human-to-human transmission so we'll see after Chinese New Year kicks off, but the one is coming at some point. One of the key characteristics of a likely pandemic are that people will be infectious while they have few or no symptoms prior to becoming  sick, so both you and they won't know they should be avoided."

>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is closely monitoring an outbreak caused by a novel (new) coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Chinese authorities identified the new coronavirus, which has resulted in more than 40 confirmed human infections in China with [two deaths reportedexternal icon](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011609057).

Where does it come from?

>patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China have reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Some patients in the outbreak reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, suggesting that some limited person-to-person spread is occurring.

Good news:

> They report no sustained spread of this virus in the community

And:

>several hundred health care workers caring for outbreak patients are being monitored and no spread of this virus from patients to health care workers has been detected

Which is good news because it indicates likely low infectivity unlike ebola or influenza.   


So why do we care? Concern that it may be more like SARS, but we just don't know yet. For perspective, influenza this year:

>CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 13 million flu illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations and 6,600 deaths from flu.

>Dr. Cornelio Cuachon Jr., Aklan provincial health officer, denied, however, that the three were quarantined as erroneously reported by other media outlets.

>An international alert is up for the coronavirus which causes pneumonia and death and which was first reported in Wuhan, capital of China’s Hubei province.
>”We just took samples from them and they were allowed to proceed to Boracay. They were all outpatients,” Cuachon told the INQUIRER.
>He said the three tourists had “mild” cases of fever, colds and cough.
>Quarantine involved the restriction of movement of persons and goods to prevent the spread of human, animal or plant diseases.

>A 29-year-old woman was referred to the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbukon Memorial Hospital, the provincial hospital of Aklan, for medical tests on Jan. 17 by staff of the Bureau of Quarantine at the Kalibo International Airport (KIA).

>She had to stay overnight at the hospital after arriving at 9 p.m. before proceeding to Boracay on Jan. 18, according to Cuachon.
>On Jan. 18, a three-year-old girl, also a Chinese national, was brought to the hospital and tested before being released.
>On Monday (Jan. 20),  a 65-year-old man from China was also referred to the hospital for tests.

>Cuachon said the blood and saliva samples would be sent to the Department of Health office in Iloilo City and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Manila before it is determined whether the tourists were coronavirus carriers.

>Dr. Marlyn Convocar, DOH Western Visayas director, said health officials were still validating reports about the three tourists.
>”We have not yet received a formal report from the provincial health office,” Concovar said.
>The process of validation, she said, would require that the regional DOH office first meet with provincial health officials, officials of the provincial hospital and Bureau of Quarantine.
>Health surveillance has been heightened at the KIA, gateway to Boracay, early this year as the airport caters to international flights.
>The KIA services planes carrying mainly tourists bound for Boracay Island with Chinese tourists recording the highest number of visitors among foreign guests.
>According to the World Health Organization, the coronavirus belongs to “a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases.”
>These more severe diseases included the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and the deadlier Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, the WHO said.

2020-01-20,bruceleebewaterfire,sydney,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/ernaia/passengers_arriving_from_coronavirus_epicentre_to/ff4qswc/,"""There is no need for alarm and the risk to the Australian  public from this novel coronavirus remains relatively low,"" Brendan  Murphy told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday.

""Although, we do need to keep a precautionary and active surveillance of the situation.""

Professor  Murphy said the screening procedures were being implemented ""because  Australia has a significant number of international travellers"" and  would begin on Thursday, two days before Chinese New Year.

He said  it was not known how easily the virus could be transmitted from  human-to-human, as compared with animal-to-human, after Chinese media  revealed overnight that health workers had been infected and that cases of the virus had been recorded in Beijing and Guangdong province.

On  Tuesday morning local time, health authorities in Wuhan confirmed a  fourth person had died from pneumonia following the coronavirus outbreak  in the city.

Airlines had declared ""a number"" of ill  passengers under normal biosecurity protocols and state health  authorities had assessed them, Professor Murphy said, but none had been  confirmed as coronavirus cases.

He said anyone who experienced symptoms after entering Australia should ""seek medical attention"".

Professor  Murphy said the decision to rely on self disclosure was based on  evidence that screening passengers by taking their temperature at the  border was ""ineffective"" and gave people a ""false sense of security"",  saying the virus had an incubation period of one week.

""In the flu pandemic, it missed a large number of cases,"" he said.

Biosecurity information about the virus was also being provided to travellers at all other ports of entry to Australia, he said.

Professor  Murphy said he was working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and  Trade on potentially updating travel advice to warn Australians  travelling to Wuhan to ""avoid markets with live animals"".

Wuhan, the sprawling capital of central China's Hubei province, is the epicentre of the new coronavirus.

South Korea also confirmed its first case of the virus in a  Chinese woman who flew from Wuhan to Incheon airport on Sunday. Three  cases were earlier reported in Thailand and Japan.

The new coronavirus has also spread to more Chinese cities, with two cases reported in the capital Beijing and one in Shenzen.

At  least half a dozen countries in Asia have begun screening programs, and  the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [has also started screening passengers arriving from Wuhan at three airports.](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53skq)

""Australia has well-established mechanisms to detect and respond to  ill travellers, and processes in place to add to these if risk  increases,"" Professor Murphy said.

Early cases of the virus, known as 2019-nCoV, were first linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down.

However,  the World Health Organisation and other health authorities have now  noted there is evidence of limited human-to-human transmission of the  disease. In Wuhan alone, there have been about 200 cases of 2019-nCoV,  with 136 of those detected on the weekend.

Meanwhile, the head of a Chinese government expert team, Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert, confirmed [two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the virus](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53t65) from family members, state media said. Some medical workers have also tested positive for the virus, the English-language *China Daily* newspaper said.

Associate  Professor Adam Kamradt-Scott, from the Centre for International  Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said while authorities  were ""[operating in the dark to a certain degree](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53ssy)"", there was no evidence of ""widespread human-to-human transmission"".

""Otherwise we'd be seeing a large number of cases, far beyond what we've currently got.""

Professor  Murphy said he met with his state and territory counterparts in the  Australian Health Protection Principal Committee to discuss Australia's  response to the new virus on Monday afternoon.

""The department is  also actively discussing the matter with the Department of Agriculture,  which manages Australia’s biosecurity at the border, including human  health, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which manages  travel advice through Smartraveller,"" he said.

Chinese authorities  said the outbreak was ""still preventable and controllable"" and added it  would increase monitoring over the Lunar New Year period that starts  this week, to reassure the public as hundreds of millions of people  prepare to travel before the country's biggest annual holiday.

The  novel coronavirus is notable because of similarities with the one that  sparked Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, 17 years ago. Unlike  SARS, which killed almost 800 people, the 2019-nCov isn't known to have  spread to health workers.

""The source of the new type of  coronavirus has not been found, we do not fully understand how the virus  is transmitted, and changes in the virus still need to be closely  monitored,"" China's National Health Commission said on Sunday.

Coronaviruses  are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people, and  others that circulate among animals, including camels, cats and bats,  the CDC said. Animal coronaviruses rarely evolve and infect people and  then spread between people."

The flu kills 650,000 out of 3-5 million infected people per year, which, on the lower end, is 13 percent of all infected. Almost all of the deaths are persons under the age of five or over the age of 65 (and especially over 70-75 -- 65 is reported to be more conservative), and a significant number of those are people with highly compromised immune systems.

Four out of 222 people have died from this ""epidemic"" so far, which isn't even two percent of those infected -- and, guess what? They were all old.

I would also like to point out that 222 infections in almost a month in a country of *1.4 billion people* is hilariously insignificant.

Finally, it really pisses me off that the media is preying on the general population's ignorance of viruses by referring to this as a ""coronavirus."" Coronaviruses are one of like four types of viruses that cause the common cold. Why aren't we seeing headlines like ""New strain of the common cold kills a few people in China, well under the number dead during an average flu season""?

So for example, SARS was a coronavirus, and was spread exclusively through respiratory droplets i.e. airborne. Also, if someone put their hand in a large amount of those droplets after they settled somewhere and then touched their mouth, they’d also be infected. So the only way to contract the virus is by breathing it in or putting it in your airway, which is why mask alone is typically fine. This new pneumonia is also a coronavirus, but I guess they’re being super extra careful with the gowns because they don’t know all the details about it.

> BEIJING - An outbreak of a new coronavirus has spread to more Chinese cities, including the capital Beijing and Shanghai, authorities said on Monday, and a fourth case has been reported beyond China&#039;s borders.

> &quot;Wuhan is a major hub and with travel being a huge part of the fast approaching Chinese New Year, the concern level must remain high. There is more to come from this outbreak,&quot; said Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity.

> The Geneva-based U.N. agency later convened an emergency committee for Wednesday to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken to manage it.
