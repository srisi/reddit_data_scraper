&#x200B;

""Today we learned a patient we are treating here at UC Davis Medical Center for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is being investigated by the CDC as possibly the first patient to have received the infection from exposure in the community. 

This patient was transferred to us from another Northern California hospital on Wednesday, Feb 19. When the patient arrived, the patient had already been intubated, was on a ventilator, and given droplet protection orders because of an undiagnosed and suspected viral condition. Since the patient arrived with a suspected viral infection, our care teams have been taking the proper infection prevention (contact droplet) precautions during the patient’s stay. 

Upon admission, our team asked public health officials if this case could be COVID-19. We requested COVID-19 testing by the CDC, since neither Sacramento County nor CDPH is doing testing for coronavirus at this time. Since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID-19, a test was not immediately administered. UC Davis Health does not control the testing process. 

On Sunday, the CDC ordered COVID-19 testing of the patient and the patient was put on airborne precautions and strict contact precautions, because of our concerns about the patient’s condition.  Today the CDC confirmed the patient’s test was positive. 

This is not the first COVID-19 patient we have treated, and because of the precautions we have had in place since this patient’s arrival, we believe there has been minimal potential for exposure here at UC Davis Medical Center.  

We are proud of our health care workers who have been working to care for this patient and are committed to saving this patient’s life.  Just as when a health care worker has a small chance of exposure to other illnesses, such as TB or pertussis, we are following standard CDC protocols for determination of exposure and surveillance.  So, out of an abundance of caution, in order to assure the health and safety of our employees, we are asking a small number of employees to stay home and monitor their temperature.  We are handling this in the same way we manage other diseases that require airborne precautions and monitoring.  We are in constant communication with the state health department and the CDC and Sacramento County Public Health about the optimal management of this patient and possible employee exposures. 

As we regularly handle patients with infectious diseases, we have robust infection control protocols in place to handle this patient and others with more frequently seen infectious diseases.  In this case, we are dedicated to providing the best care possible for this patient and continuing to protect the health of our employees who care for them. 

There are a number of informational resources, including a Q&A and background information on COVID-19 on The Insider and the UC Davis Health website."""

Officials have begun tracing the contacts of the resident to find out how the person may have been infected and who else might have been exposed..

This is a developing story. It will be updated.

A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday as several other countries also confirmed new cases and deaths, and President Trump called for a 6:30 p.m. news conference with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others to discuss the spread of the virus. He accused the media of stoking panic about financial markets.

The Dow Jones industrial average endured its worst two-day slump in four years Tuesday. On Wednesday, it was up 300 points shortly after open, but closed down about 124 points.

On European and Asian financial markets, economic alarms continued to flash, however, with cases spreading and little sign that the epidemic was relenting after the CDC warned of the “inevitable” spread in the United States of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

A person in California who was not exposed to anyone with the coronavirus and had not traveled to countries in which the virus is circulating has tested positive for the new coronavirus, representing what may be the first case of community spread here in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.

“At this point, the patient’s exposure is unknown,” a C.D.C. statement said. “The case was detected through the U.S. public health system and picked up by astute clinicians.”

>  
>The health ministry confirmed the case was the first in Japan where a patient tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being discharged from hospital, the Nikkei newspaper said.

That statement is confusing. So she tested positive in late January and was discharged after being recovered (whatever that means) and got seriously sick again and tested positive.

There could still be the case, that the initial sickness was a wrong positive (or the sickness now). 

Another possible explanation is delivered in the article:

>“Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,” said Philip Tierno Jr., Professor of Microbiology and Pathology at NYU School of Medicine.

So, we should wait for some more information on cases like these."

There's also the fact that this would likely be very difficult to do in practice. In another thread about the European outbreaks, they compared the likelihood of border closings in those countries to that of border closings of states in the US.

I've just reread my comment and it sounds really aggressive, I'm sorry but I was pissed off by the level of misinformation in the comments.

First, what are these bonds? They are titles emitted by the world bank. These bonds work as follows: you buy them from the world bank for X dollars. If, after a certain set period, no pandemic occurs, the world bank pays you back X plus interest.

Why would you buy these bonds? Basically they are bought by pension funds looking for a good interest rate.

Why does the world bank sell them? Because if a pandemic DOES occur, these bonds will default. This means that, instead of giving back investors X plus interest, the world bank will use X money to actually fight against this pandemic.

This is no different from an insurance: a company ""bets"" that your house will not catch fire over the next year. If they are right, you pay them a fee. If they are wrong, your damage is covered by the insurance.

This has nothing to do with ""rich people getting richer at the cost of the lifes of the poor"". If you think it's immoral or should be illegal, then a house or car insurance should probably be a felony too.

That being said, the article IS badly written. It starts by saying the bonds will be set to default if the WHO declares a pandemic, then later explains ""The conditions under which the payout on bonds will default are staggered based on how rapidly the disease spreads, the number of deaths associated with the illness, and whether the virus crosses international borders"".

It is also clickbait in the sense that it portrays an insurance fund from the WHO as some kind of crazy betting system, as if it was highly unusual or bizarre. Also, there are tons of other bonds which will mature in other dates, but they chose to talk about those maturing in June 2020 as if they were the only ones.

I tried my best, hope this helps a bit to clarify this shitshow of an article."

To this moment, Iran is basically trying to sweep everything under the rug with Rouhani stating that everyone must continue working as normal, only take some minor precautions, but that work must continue to keep the economy going.

Also consider that mere days after we found out that nCoV was in Iran, dozens of cases popped up in Bahrain and Kuwait, and a couple in Canada, all from Iran. Qom is the center of the outbreak in Iran, a city of 1.2 million without even any airport. To add to all this, Iran's minister of health is sick, and Iran has flat-out stated that sanctions are hindering their ability to test for the sickness.

So not only is there serious negligence on Iran's part, but they simply don't have the capability to do any considerable amount of testing. It's almost certain that the actual number of infected individuals is in the high-thousands at minimum, with many more deaths than are being reported, but that the ratio of reported deaths to actual deaths is higher than the ratio of reported cases to actual cases, since it's easier to identify the virus in seriously-ill or expired patients."

Basically:  started more than 12 weeks ago, 20 deaths in more than one country, 250 or more deaths, and more.     
= = = = = = = = = = = = = =

For Flu
(a) There must be at least 5,000 confirmed cases (counted from all countries worldwide) within a rolling 42-day period. For these cases, the virus needs to satisfy the following conditions:

i. WHO Report states that such Virus is an influenza A virus (either through a statement or by denoting such influenza Virus with an “A” prior to its genetic subtype);

ii. Such WHO Report states either:

▪ that such influenza A virus is a new or novel influenza A virus with a new or novel genetic subtype, and no Case of or Death relating to such influenza A virus has been reported in any WHO Report published prior to July 2017; or

▪ that such influenza A virus is an influenza A virus whose hemagglutinin gene is antigenically distinct, due to an antigenic shift, from those in seasonal influenza viruses circulating in the 35 years prior to July 2017; and

iii. Such WHO Report states that the influenza A virus is experiencing sustained or effective human-to-human transmission.

(b) The Growth Rate needs to be greater than zero after the first 42 days and the Growth Rate Mean needs to be greater than or equal to 0.265, for any day after the first 42 days

(c) When (a) and (b) are met, the influenza pandemic would be confirmed and 100% of the maximum US$275 million coverage would be released.

For Non-flu

(d) At least 12 weeks have passed from the date of the start of the event

(e) The outbreak needs to be in more than one country (IDA or IBRD), with each such country having greater than or equal to 20 Confirmed Deaths

(f) The Growth Rate needs to be greater than zero to ensure that the outbreak is growing at a specific statistical confidence level

(g) The Total Confirmed Death Amount needs to be greater than or equal to 250

(h) The Rolling Total Case Amount needs to be greater than or equal to 250

(i) The Rolling Confirmed Case Amount needs to comprise a minimum percentage of the Rolling Total Case Amount

(j) Regional outbreaks affecting two to seven countries would activate payments of Pandemic Bond/Insurance Payout Amounts at three stages as the number of total confirmed deaths increases. Global outbreaks affecting eight or more countries also activate payments at three stages but provide access to higher funding levels at the first two triggers."

It's a reasonable assumption that hospitals become overwhelmed. You don't want to break your arm, or have accident that requires emergency response in some other way. Heart attacks, stroke, or other medical emergency will be at increased risk during this time. Have first aid kits on hand.

For most that probably means bunker down at home. By now you should have food and water in your emergency supplies. Plan to not go anywhere for a while. The difficulties with that plan differ for individual situation. You might play tiddlywinks. Bring a book.

In Wuhan we observe even during a strict quarantine their water and electricity appears to be running. In most areas that will probably remain the case. But in the event that is not the case, additional water storage may be of value and some method to cook the emergency food prep you have on hand.

Dependent on duration of bunker down you get self defense considerations.

Worst case scenario, deficiencies in what you have prepped mean you get to suit up and go outside to try and scavenge what you need. Anticipate more people than you are comfortable with will be in a similar situation. Odds increase you get through it by simply catching COVID-19 and probably surviving.

In long run sufficient recoveries are out there that the thing burns itself out for the time being. Likelihood of waves of it in the not so distant future, suppose we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

Supply chain headaches will be longer lasting. But that will work itself over the long-run as well and lead to a stronger world economy that has constructed redundancies based on what broke."
