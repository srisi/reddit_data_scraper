A sub has no financial motivation to do so. Mods are trying to keep this fact-based, and ""the fact it's a possible weapon"" is not a fact. Everything is possible, that doesn't make it ""a fact"". It's a misleading use of words. Like saying ""I deliver only facts, like the fact I'm full of BS.""

It's a possible bioweapon? I mean everything is possible, isn't it? ""The coronavirus is a possible human extermination attack by aliens trying to take over the planet"". Is it a fact this is possible? I mean, it's possible, however unlikely. Should we discuss it here? No.

The ""biological weapon"" theories are useless because they're not actionable. They don't help us understand the virus, they don't help us fight it, or prepare for it. If it was a textbook ""bioweapon"" then the cure would be available, and China wouldn't let it spread to & kill so many people and having to quarantine millions in attempt to slow it down.

Let's say it's a bioweapon regardless. What are you gonna do with that? Stop pointing the finger at bats and start pointing it to Chinese labs? Will that make you feel better? It sure won't do shit for curbing the outbreak."
2020-02-17,CaptainFentanyl,Coronavirus,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f51lh9/shenzhen_factory_just_told_me_on_hold_till_virus/fhwhzot/,"Several companies that supplies my place of work who ship from Hong Kong and mainland China and some personal business associates shipping the same region have advised us to expect delays and we have experienced late and still unaccounted for deliveries of laboratory equipment, bulk and specialty chemical precursors. 
Oddly we received samples (very expensive, microgram quantities) of nCoV and other coronavirus antigens for laboratory use rather quickly as soon as they became available; this is probably due to the unprecedented scientific response to the new virus, we need these substances urgently to experiment with to confirm/refute properties of the new virus calculated using molecular dynamics simulations and to discover new properties that could be exploited in the search for new therapeutics. 
Very rarely does in silico modelling perfectly predict the affinity of one substance has to bind to another based on calculation of interaction energies - performing binding assays in the lab allows us to measure empirically the strength of ligand-protein interactions for example, using reversible chemical reactions, one or more methods of accurately measuring very low concentrations of substances and a bit of calculation. 

In a research paper from a few years ago computer simulation was used to model docking between a wide range of strong opioid analgesic drugs (in the state they exist in the brain at physiological pH) and the Mu opioid receptor - the model predicted strong binding for only around 60% of them. It also predicted that Morphine wouldn’t bind very well at all and was expected to be a poor Mu ligand when of course we know and measure that this is not true, Morphine is objectively a strong analgesic and we measure it binding to the receptor with low nanomolar affinity. 

Anyway; nCoV spike binds to ACE2 but it’s binding domain is not the same as the ACE2 catalytic domain; nCoV doesn’t bind to what one would call ACE2’s active site where it acts as a zinc carboxypeptidase to remove a single amino acid from the end of Angiotensin peptide molecules. 
Some researchers are looking to discover ACE2-antibody conjugate drugs that would bind to nCoV blocking it from binding to cellular ACE2. We are looking for molecules that bind to ACE2 at the nCoV receptor binding domain that also preferably don’t interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2. 

Positive results from both of these research pathways would result in putative nCoV entry inhibitor drugs (a new class of drugs or several new classes) that can then be tested in animals and eventually humans. 
Vaccines are also another large research area however I am more interested in the classes of compounds I described earlier as vaccines most often are most useful before exposure to the virus enabling a more specific and rapid immune response - some have disease modifying effects in the already infected but they almost always must be given within hours of exposure to be most effective (rabies vaccine, smallpox vaccine) - so a vaccine probably isn’t going to be much use to the already infected especially since the rather long incubation period results in many people not realising that they were exposed until they have been infected for however many days it takes for them to have symptoms, some sources state this to be 1-14days and could be longer. 

Antiviral drugs, like the already existing classes of protease inhibitors RdRP inhibitors and hopefully nCoV entry inhibitors, if effective can be curative or disease modifying (preventing COVID-19 disease progression to severe pneumonia, ARDS and death) in even the most critically ill patients. 

The work continues and does so at a rapid pace, the number of molecules that we’re able to screen for ACE2 binding and then antiviral activity in such a short amount of time is incredible and wouldn’t have been possible 20+ years ago mainly due to great advancements in computing power available to researchers. 

Even if vaccines fail, I still don’t think all would be lost as I’m very confident that a range of effective antivirals with multiple targets and of multiple drug classes will eventually (likely quicker than usual) enter clinical practice just as the outbreak has allowed the use and study of unapproved or approved for other purpose substances, especially Remdesivir, to be used in patients that have no other option (compassionate use) and the already sick that consent to receiving an unapproved drug that has not completed the required clinical trials (investigational use in the sick patient with no other option that is still lucid enough to consent to be part of the experiment). 

So the new vaccine and therapeutic pathways to treatment at going as fast as they can; we really are. 
However; if nCoV gets significantly out of China (10000+ international cases) we may start to see variation in infectivity between people from different ethnic backgrounds - the expression of ACE2 varies amongst humans with East Asian populations expressing it most highly (in peer reviewed and preprint studies). 
And in addition to that; one of the greatest patient populations amongst white British people (where I’m based) is people with cardiovascular disease especially primary and smoking/diabetes/obesity induced hypertension. 
These people are well treated by modern medicine with a wide variety of CV drugs. Two that are of significance here are the ACE inhibitors (not ACE2) and the AT1 antagonists - two types of common antihypertensives prescribed in the west that work via inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensins-ACE-AT1 axis. A worrying feature of this confirmed in peer reviewed literature is that use of both classes of these drugs induces ACE2 expression. 

[Article](https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/73/3/463/367423) 

So those using these classes of drugs for CV disease may be more at risk along with the risk varying depending on ones racial background; CV drugs are well known for some classes being more effective for people of one racial background and another being more effective for people of a different racial background both suffering from similar CV conditions. 

The evidence isn’t all there yet with regards to nCoV infection but if the virus does go pandemic then to survive we are all eventually going to have to take risks; the research suggest that when taking those risks one should consider people close to you/that you live with taking ACE inhibitors or AT1 antagonists (and probably other classes of drugs) not only because they already have a pre-existing condition but because their treatment for it has been shown to induce ACE2 expression which may make them particular susceptible to nCoV. 

(All the above is just a bit more info on how treatments for nCoV can be discover and how susceptibility to infection most probably varies amongst humans. 
By no means is it a recommendation to stop taking any drugs that your doctor prescribes for you - as always only ever take or stop taking medication as your doctor prescribes. 
The science is constantly developing and more definite answers to all of these questions will come with time. And to further dissuade anyone using those two classes of CV drugs from stopping taking them to try’s and prevent nCoV infection in pandemic conditions; usage of ACE inhibitors and AT1 antagonists upregulates ACE2 expression over a longer period of time than the incubation period and even the course of COVID-19 disease; stopping using those drugs would not only be dangerous for your CV health and against your doctor’s prescription advice but also stopping taking them wouldn’t immediately eliminate all the upregualted ACE2 expression (ACE2 would only then be downregualted back to the unmedicated level over weeks to months as the expression of the ACE2 gene changes and the cells remove an recycle ACE2 from the cellular membranes - this is not an instantaneous effect, if you do use these CV drugs stopping using them will not help you nor is there evidence yet to prove that stopping them will help you even if you have 6 months notice before nCoV exposure)

Here’s hoping for restoration of normal length consignment deliveries from China as well as the improved health of the populations affected very soon. And if this doesn’t occur naturally; millions of us working in pharmaceuticals will not stop until we have more treatment options that drastically reduce the mortality rate (even if the only motivator for some is profit). 
I don’t particularly agree with profiteering from humanitarian crises; if written in here in the past regarding HIV patients that essentially now have to pay and subscribe to life. 
Without a definite cure for nCoV (or HIV for that matter) if my place of work produces a successful disease modifying drug or preventative non vaccine treatment for nCoV, I will argue that we give it away for a penny more than the cost it takes to produce it given the current epidemic. I will almost definitely lose that arguement and if nCoV infection and a drug to treat it become commonplace; a few people will become very rich; I won’t be one of them, but I certainly hope that my team at least gets to put their names to some of the research leading to the widespread use of a treatment that makes nCoV infection treatable with a mortality rate approaching zero."

Some hospitals in Canada started increasing their bed supply and supply of ventilators to gear up for possible outbreaks... they have less confirmed cases in Canada than US but it sounds like they’re more prepared.

More cases will pop up on local news levels but will likely be pushed as severe pneumonia and say there is no information if this is related to the Covid-19 coronavirus.  Many more will get sick in the US and many will brush it off like it's nothing and they will spread it.  In about 4-6 weeks, it will finally hit the news and majority of US residents will start questioning things and asking what we have been asking weeks ago in this forum.  I think in some major cities, school districts will push for a 14-day quarantine and broadcast in school packets that go to the parents and on local news to go to a clinic or call a local emergency number if symptoms become severe.

I don't think there will be a panic until people are collapsing in the streets and state/city/gov't officials cannot simply say this was a nasty flu this season.  I imagine there to be medical supply shortages of medicines (prescribes & OTC) and antibiotics near the end of March to early May.

What's worse is that, I think the reinfection is going to kill a LOT of people.  Surviving the initial infection is tough from what I've read regarding what it does and what people have said but a re-infection could amplify the damaged areas of the body and lead to death by asphyxiation or internal bleeding.

I don't have sources to back up my claims but I've watched and read lots of videos/articles on this thing and have been following since January.  As long as this virus is in a host that is alive, the human race is in danger.

Once this phase is active, then it'll be time to draw predictions for phase 2. What happens when 5%-10%-30% of the population is gone and resources get scarce."

I get it if you’d feel your symptoms are severe and are not sure you can manage at home - or if you have underlying lung disease, immune suppression, or elderly and frail.

Here's the thing- it's already widely known and reported that bat SARS coronavirus was being studied in Wuhan, and that bat populations were being maintained and sampled.  This isn't news beyond the fact the research wasn't exclusively happening 20km away, but also 280m away.

It's actually worse than this, because you're usually giving the vaccine to a lot of people who wouldn't get the virus to begin with. Wuhan has 10,000,000 people - you vaccinate them all but your vaccine has a .1% (one tenth of one percent) fatality rate. You've just killed 10,000 people. 

(People have no idea how absurdly safe vaccines have to be in order to be released.). 

The worldwide Coronavirus death toll is still under 2,000. China would have to be reporting only 1/5th of the actual deaths for it to still be better than a vaccine with a mere .1% fatality rate applied just to everyone in Wuhan. 

Meanwhile, there have already been several treatments which might end up being quite effective (antivirals, antibodies via plasma from survivors, etc) which reduce the death rate with no comparable collateral damage."

> SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts.

> In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic.

> JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG

> WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus.

> The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness.

> 

> “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.

> “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added.

> And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to.

> VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS

> Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness.

> “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures.

> “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.”

> According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia.

> 

> “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong.

> 

> “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.”

> According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder.

> If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong.

> He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading.

> According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months.

> In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS.

> ""This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam.

> ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again.""

> Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder.

> “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.”

> TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR

> Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1.

> “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong.

> Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild.

> Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong.

> “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added.

> Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19.

> Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said.

> ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.”

> Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example.

> “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said.

> “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.”

> Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.”

Disease scientist bases estimate on transmissibility of virus 
WHO has said China quarantines provide a ‘window’ to prepare 

As the number of coronavirus cases jumps dramatically in China, a top infectious-disease scientist warns that things could get far worse: Two-thirds of the world’s population could catch it. 


So says Ira Longini, an adviser to the World Health Organization who tracked studies of the virus’s transmissibility in China. His estimate implies that there could eventually be billions more infections than the current official tally of about 60,000."

I've changed the dates of ""non-refundable"" flight tickets before by paying fees around 25000¥. This would be better than wasting the whole ticket right? Call them and ask about your options. It can only be done by phone. Even non refundable flights can be changed if you pay said fee. If you must cancel though, look through your credit card insurances and stuff. Some include travel insurance and you may have a chance they have a cancellation policy. Good luck!"

Disease scientist bases estimate on transmissibility of virus 
WHO has said China quarantines provide a ‘window’ to prepare 

As the number of coronavirus cases jumps dramatically in China, a top infectious-disease scientist warns that things could get far worse: Two-thirds of the world’s population could catch it. 


So says Ira Longini, an adviser to the World Health Organization who tracked studies of the virus’s transmissibility in China. His estimate implies that there could eventually be billions more infections than the current official tally of about 60,000."

> SHANGHAI - The number of reported new cases of coronavirus in China&#039;s Hubei province rose on Monday after two days of falls, as authorities imposed tough new restrictions on movement to prevent the spread of the disease which has now killed more than 1,700 people.

> Many economists expect China&#039;s economic growth to slow and ratings agency Moody&#039;s on Monday revised downward its 2020 GDP growth forecasts for China to 5.2%. That compares with the 5.7% growth China would need this year to meet its long-term goal of doubling GDP over the decade to 2020, according to a government economist.

> Some 355 people on board have tested positive for the disease, by far the largest cluster of cases outside China.

> SINGAPORE - Singapore's approach to the coronavirus outbreak is the ""gold standard"" for case detection, according to a new study at Harvard University, with researchers using Singapore as a benchmark for other countries.

> The study concluded that the global number of cases of Covid-19, as the disease has been called, would be 2.8 times more than it is currently if every other country had the same detection capacity as Singapore.

> ""We consider the detection of 18 cases by Feb 4, 2020 in Singapore to be a gold standard of near-perfect detection,"" wrote four epidemiologists at Harvard's T. H. Chan School of Public Health.

> ""We estimated that detection of exported cases from Wuhan worldwide is 38 per cent as sensitive as it has been in Singapore.""

> Among what the study calls ""high surveillance"" countries, the number was 40 per cent. The study said detection ability among ""low surveillance"" countries, was just 11 per cent of Singapore's.

> High surveillance countries were defined as those that scored the highest on the Global Health Security Index (GHSI), which ranks countries on their disease prevention, detection, reporting and response capabilities, among other things.

> The researchers also referred to a previous study from the school which highlighted Singapore as a statistical anomaly when it tried to estimate how many cases each country should have based on travel volume from China.

> The researchers had examined aggregated data from a Feb 4 World Health Organisation report on the number of cases imported by travellers with known travel history to China to 191 countries and regions. The study excluded Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

> The researchers then used historical data from the International Air Travel Association and other sources to estimate the number of daily air travel passengers from Wuhan, where the virus originated, to locations outside of China.

> ""Among countries with substantial travel volume, Singapore showed the highest ratio of detected imported cases to daily travel volume, a ratio of one case per five daily travelers,"" the study's authors wrote.

> ""Singapore is historically known for exceptionally sensitive detection of cases, for example in Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and has had extremely detailed case reporting during the Covid-19 outbreak.""

> Related Story Interactive: Places impacted by the coronavirus so far

> One implication of the latest study is that the virus could have remained undetected after being exported from Wuhan to various locations worldwide before the city was locked down on Jan 23, the authors noted.

> The Harvard study was uploaded to a free online health sciences archive called medRxiv on Friday as an unpublished manuscript.

> The report is complete but the website notes that such manuscripts, or preprints, are ""preliminary reports of work that have not been peer reviewed"" that should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behaviour.

However while it may be more scientifically correct, it does seem to be trying to raise a barrier to discussion about the virus...

There were \~two million Hong Kong citizens in the  streets protesting the proposed extradition treaty, re-education camps,  and Chinese rule in general prior to the COVID-19 outbreak and  soon-to-be-pandemic; almost complete radio silence now, probably the  only possible way the protests could have been quashed so effectively  short of martial law being imposed, which subsequently has been enacted  on several different fronts now as the result anyway.

Agenda:  kill off all of the protests; exterminate millions if not all of those pesky re-education prisoners; get rid of the financial burden of  millions of 50+ age male retirees while solving the 3:1 male-to-female  gender gap ratio caused by decades of an abhorrent Communist one-child  family planning policy; fuck up the global world economy in general thus  weakening considerably the petro $ as a global reserve currency, and in  turn opening the door for a cryptocurrency-based Yuan global reserve  currency replacement (burning coronavirus-contaminated cash and all of  that symbolic horseshit being used by the Chinese central media to usher  in a mandatory cashless payments system); and, flood the airwaves with  hundreds of psyop videos showcasing thug CCP henchmen beating and  seriously injuring senior citizens, women, and little children on public  streets and in private homes...

Looking for some purchase advice. I have a fun event coming up late March. It is formal but people tend to be a little eccentric in style. 

I had a very specific vision for my outfit. I was planning to wear a Burgandy Double Breasted suit with cream or light brown buttons and a wide peak lapel, a cream or camel [turtleneck](https://www.asos.com/us/asos-design/asos-design-oversized-roll-neck-sweater-with-diagonal-rib-texture-in-ecru/prd/13630769?clr=ecru&colourWayId=16553155&SearchQuery=&cid=7617), and my [Taft oxfords](https://taftclothing.com/collections/shoes-1/products/the-jack-shoe-in-grey-brown). 

I was planning to order a custom suit from Suitsupply, I have two other (more professional) custom suits from them, but I was stopped by a major roadblock. Unfortunately, due to coronavirus, it seems that Suitsupply's usual 3-4 week turnaround for custom suits is now 8-9 weeks. A few other MTM shops seem to be having the same problem. Indochino, oddly, seems to not have any delay. I have bought Indochino before but I want to avoid it given their lower quality fabric and the almost certain need for a remake or major tailoring. 

As far as I can tell I have a few options: 

* Buy this [Burgandy 2-button](https://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/suits/havana-burgundy-suit/P6052I27.html) from Suitsupply off-the-rack. Pros: It is the exact fabric I want, they have my size, I can probably re-wear this to events in the future without being over-the-top. Cons: Lose out on the double-breasted fun, pouch pockets on a single-breasted suit aren't my thing, super-wide notch lapel looks less-than-pleasant to my eyes, and button color is not appealing.
* Buy the custom suit from Suitsupply and hope that it arrives on time. Return if not and just wear a normal suit to the event. Pros: If it shows up on time, I get my dream-fun suit in the exact specification and fabric that I want. If not on time, just return the suit- suitsupply offers free returns even on custom suits. Cons: High likelihood that I am going to get the suit in April and be sad. 
* Take the risk on [Indochino.](https://www.indochino.com/product/hemsworth-burgundy-suit) Pros: Cheaper for a suit that I probably won't wear too often; can customize exactly to the wild specifications listed above. Cons: High chance that the suit will need to be remade (or at least majorly tailored), lower quality fabric, possibility that Indochino will also be delayed due to coronavirus but they aren't aware yet. 


If anyone has any other ideas, they'd be massively appreciated. Budget is $800 tops. I cannot do Made-to-Measure at suit supply (the step up from 'custom' ) because it is going to be $1400+. 

**For reference,** [here is a photo of me wearing](https://imgur.com/a/RAqVCM1) a double-breasted in Burgandy-flannel 40R (left) and the 2-button Burgandy linked above (42R)  at my local Suitsupply. I would need a 42S with some adjustments, so neither is a good fit here. My legs are thicc and I have wide shoulders, so the 40R is just not a realistic option. Unfortunately, they did not have the double-breasted pictured in a 42R or 42S and I cannot find it online. It is out of season apparently."

When this and other subreddits were created, one of the first issues that arose was the propagation of fake news, conspiracy theories, and so on and so forth.  The difficulty in ascertaining what's real and what's not has never become so blurred in our lifetime.  Information comes so quickly, it would almost be considered irresponsible to allow conspiracy theories and memes to coexist with relevant and important information.  Due to this, after discussing this with other moderators, it appears that bans were handed out to immediately stop the proliferation of damaging information / memes that could be construed as serious, inappropriately racially divisive, or harmful to serious discussions.  

And part of the reactive response on our part was to create filters for our automod (i.e., bioweapons).  I specifically asked the older mods about the bans for discussing bioweapons, and the consensus has been that no one has been banned *at all* for discussing bioweapons.  However, there is an active filter due to the issues the cropped up as indicated above.

This is why we created /r/COVID19 to try and encourage scientific discussions, while using /r/coronavirus as a general discussion platform.  

-------------------------------------------------------------

That being said: As a mod team, we are definitely not immune from criticism.  A few mistakes were made and that it wasn't discussed freely with the community in mind was a mistake.  What is a reputable news source?  What are banned phrases?  What would lead to a ban?  There are things we are actively seeking to improve, with regards to both what sources can be used, and how we filter certain keywords or phrases.  To be honest, our fear is allowing this subreddit and others like it falling trap to the propagation of fake news and becoming quarantined like certain subreddits I won't name here. Reddit's policy has been to not allow threats or discussions of death or violence that are discussed irresponsibly and harmfully.  To that end, some of the bans we've implemented were due to that.  Other bans were due to sensationalized headlines (editorialized), or proliferation of news that could not be verified (Youtube videos), spamming, and so on and so forth.  This is why certain subreddits were quarantined.

-------------------------------------------------------------

It's a tough position trying to ensure content is being posted and discussed responsibly while trying to be hands off as well.  As a new subreddit, it's a maturing process we are trying to speed up a bit with the number of new moderators we've brought on board. 

Discussion about this subject needs to continue and should be able to continue without interference.  Our issue is that the discussion of this will inevitably lead to outlandish conspiracy theories as some of you have noted in this thread and other threads.  How do we manage that kind of content without impacting our user experience and maintaining a platform that encourages that discussion?

As always, feedback is appreciated."

The normal flu also has something of a head start, and that is why comparing the two is tricky.  The numbers you want to look at are:

R0: that will tell you how fast it's growing (more precisely, it's how many people you can expect to contract the disease from a single infected person, \*if\* no precautions are taken)

Mortality: if you catch it, what is the chance you die from it

A good place to start is: [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

You will find lots of information, definitions, caveats, historical info, and per country info.  

If you like maps, you might like: [Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

For the R0, I went with 2.5, which is at the top of the WHO range, but is below other estimates and in the middle of most.  That is twice as much as the 1.3 of the normal flu.

For the Mortality, I went with 3%, which is above the current WHO estimate right now (2%), but well below the accepted way to calculate mortality during an outbreak (which is 5.7% right now) and so is still probably on the low side.  

Getting the fatality rate of the normal flu is a little trickier.  I found estimates ranging from 0.01% to 0.05%.  I went with the conservative (for this calculation) number of 0.05%.  

I then got the relative death rate using those numbers: 3 / 0.05 = 60.  So we should expect that if 10,000 people get sick with the flu and 10,000 people get sick with the novel cv, then 5 will die of the flu and 300 will die of the COVID-19.

Assuming that a doubling of R0 results in a doubling of the number of infected (actually, this should be higher), and we would expect that 120 times as many people will die from COVID-19 as from the flu.  

I just worked this out for someone else (who got quite salty about it too :) ), but it will take another 3 months before we see the COVID-19 really take off, assuming the current efforts to lock it down fail.  It takes time before the exponential nature of the virus asserts itself.

I feel it necessary to add here: these are all numbers that are guesstimates.  Nobody knows the real numbers right now.  The calculations are also all based on nobody doing anything (or all efforts being fruitless).  I only want to poke a hole in the Pollyanna messaging going out right now.  This is serious and should be treated as a top priority.  Statements like, ""The flu has killed more people,"" is both correct and misleading.  

I hope some of that helped."

You should question everything you hear and criticise everything you think. That's how you get to the truth. I can tell you one key way to do this is FOLLOW THE MONEY, FOLLOW THE INTEREST. Whatever happens in the world, it doesn't matter what the corporate media is telling you, ask yourself Who is benefitting from this event? Who gets enriched from this event? For example.. Coronavirus.. It is destroying China's economy.. Then I wonder who benefits from destroying China's economy? Furthermore, Coronavirus, if outbreak in U.S, will give government the ability to put U.S citizens in detainment centers and even concentration camps as did china, then again, who is becoming more powerful if the virus outbreak in U.S? Me? You? or Government? One more thing.. as in many other viruses.. who has the capability to create these stuff? Me ? You? Darpa? CCP? 
What did 9/11 do other than giving a pretext for Bush to spend trillions of tax payer money and attack other countries and enrich military industrial complex? Who benefitted more from 9/11? The poor people of Afghanistan or George Bush and military industrial complex? You know just follow the money, follow who benefit from events, and I'm sure you can connect the dots.

The vast majority of the cases have been identified in Hubei province, China.

Specific results of the clinical trial involving favilavir, formerly known as fapilavir, have not been released. The drug was tested in 70 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in the city of Shenzhen.
The drug, developed in China by Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Company originally to treat catarrhal, or inflammation of the nose and throat, is one of three currently being investigated for possible use in the treatment of COVID-19.

The company has begun producing the drug in large quantities to meet the demand created by the outbreak, though it is not the only one being investigated for use against COVID-19.
Another drug option, remdesivir, is being developed by U.S. drugmaker Gilead. Originally intended to treat Ebola virus, remdesivir has reportedly been used to treat one American sickened with COVID-19, and the patient in question has recovered fully.
However, the drug is still undergoing clinical trials and has not yet been approved to treat either COVID-19 or Ebola.

Meanwhile, doctors in South Korea have reported that they have used the HIV combination drug lopinavir plus ritonavir -- marketed as Kaletra -- to successfully treat COVID-19 in a 54-year-old patient.
Researchers in China have also asked patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19 to donate their blood plasma for possible use as the basis of a new treatment for the virus. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Emergencies Program, said Monday the approach, known as hyperimmune globulin therapy, has been used for decades to in the treatment of viral diseases, including diphtheria.

The theory is that those who have recovered from viral infections have antibodies against the disease in their blood, and that those antibodies can be passed on to others who have been infected via transfusion, providing their immune system with a needed ""boost,"" he explained. However, the key to its effectiveness is timing -- transfusions need to be performed early enough in the course of the disease for the antibodies to work.

Chinese researchers started clinical trials of the approach in COVID-19 patients last week.""It's an important area to pursue, but it's not always successful,"" Ryan added."

Much remains unknown about the novel coronavirus ripping through China, but one thing is certain. The disease can cast a storm over the whole human body.

Such has been the nature of past zoonotic coronaviruses, ones that hopped from animals to humans like SARS and MERS. Unlike their common-cold-causing cousins, these emergent coronaviruses can spark a viral-induced fire throughout many of a person’s organs, and the new disease—dubbed ""COVID-19"" by the World Health Organization on Tuesday—is no exception when it is severe.

That helps explain why the COVID-19 epidemic has killed more than 1,500 people, surpassing the SARS death toll in a matter of weeks. While the death rate for COVID-19 appears to be a tenth of SARS, the novel coronavirus has spread faster.

Confirmed cases rose to more than 60,000 on Thursday, nearly a 50 percent jump relative to the prior day, and the tally has risen by another 7,200 since then. This leap reflects a change in the way Chinese authorities are diagnosing infections instead of a massive shift in the scope of the outbreak. Rather than wait for patients to test positive for the virus, diagnoses now include anyone whose chest scan reveals COVID-19’s distinctive pattern of pneumonia. This method will hopefully allow authorities to isolate and treat patients more quickly.

If this outbreak continues to spread, there’s no telling how harmful it could become. A leading epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong warned this week that COVID-19 could infect 60 percent of the globe if left unchecked. On Thursday, China’s National Health Commission said more than 1,700 health care workers are ill with the new virus, and the announcement came just a day after the WHO wrapped a summit on the best protocols for hospital care and the development of therapeutics, like vaccines.

But what actually happens to your body when it is infected by the coronavirus? The new strain is so genetically similar to SARS that it has inherited the title SARS-CoV-2. So combining early research on the new outbreak with past lessons from SARS and MERS can provide an answer.
The Lungs: Ground zero

For most patients, COVID-19 begins and ends in their lungs, because like the flu, coronaviruses are respiratory diseases.

They spread typically when an infected person coughs or sneezes, spraying droplets that can transmit the virus to anyone in close contact. Coronaviruses also cause flu-like symptoms: Patients might start out with a fever and cough that progresses to pneumonia or worse. (Find out how coronavirus spreads on a plane—and the safest place to sit).



After the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization reported that the disease typically attacked the lungs in three phases: viral replication, immune hyper-reactivity, and pulmonary destruction.

Not all patients went through all three phases—in fact only 25 percent of SARS patients suffered respiratory failure, the defining signature of severe cases. Likewise, COVID-19, according to early data, causes milder symptoms in about 82 percent of cases, while the remainder are severe or critical.

Look deeper, and the novel coronavirus appears to follow other patterns of SARS, says University of Maryland School of Medicine associate professor Matthew B. Frieman, who studies highly pathogenic coronaviruses.



In the early days of an infection, the novel coronavirus rapidly invades human lung cells. Those lung cells come in two classes: ones that make mucus and ones with hair-like batons called cilia.

Mucus, though gross when outside the body, helps protect lung tissue from pathogens and make sure your breathing organ doesn’t dry out. The cilia cells beat around the mucus, clearing out debris like pollen or viruses.

Frieman explains that SARS loved to infect and kill cilia cells, which then sloughed off and filled patients’ airways with debris and fluids, and he hypothesizes that the same is happening with the novel coronavirus. That’s because the earliest studies on COVID-19 have shown that many patients develop pneumonia in both lungs, accompanied by symptoms like shortness of breath.

That’s when phase two and the immune system kicks in. Aroused by the presence of a viral invader, our bodies step up to fight the disease by flooding the lungs with immune cells to clear away the damage and repair the lung tissue.

When working properly, this inflammatory process is tightly regulated and confined only to infected areas. But sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way, including your healthy tissue.

“So you get more damage instead of less from the immune response,” Frieman says. Even more debris clogs up the lungs, and pneumonia worsens. (Find out how the novel coronavirus compares to flu, Ebola, and other major outbreaks).



During the third phase, lung damage continues to build—which can result in respiratory failure. Even if death doesn’t occur, some patients survive with permanent lung damage. According to the WHO, SARS punched holes in the lungs, giving them “a honeycomb-like appearance”—and these lesions are present in those afflicted by novel coronavirus, too.

These holes are likely created by the immune system’s hyperactive response, which creates scars that both protect and stiffen the lungs.

When that occurs, patients often have to be put on ventilators to assist their breathing. Meanwhile, inflammation also makes the membranes between the air sacs and blood vessels more permeable, which can fill the lungs with fluid and affect their ability to oxygenate blood.

“In severe cases, you basically flood your lungs and you can’t breathe,” Frieman says. “That’s how people are dying.”
The Stomach: A shared gateway

During the SARS and MERS outbreaks, nearly a quarter of patients had diarrhea—a much more significant feature of those zoonotic coronaviruses. But Frieman says it’s still not clear whether gastrointestinal symptoms play a major part in the latest outbreak, given cases diarrhea and abdominal pain have been rare. But why does a respiratory virus bother the gut at all?

When any virus enters your body, it looks for human cells with its favorite doorways—proteins on the outside of the cells called receptors. If the virus finds a compatible receptor on a cell, it can invade.



Some viruses are picky about which door they choose, but others are a little more promiscuous. “They can very easily penetrate into all types of cells,” says Anna Suk-Fong Lok, assistant dean for clinical research at the University of Michigan Medical School and former president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Both SARS and MERS viruses can access the cells that line your intestines and large and small colon, and those infections appear to flourish in the gut, potentially causing the damage or the leakage of fluid that becomes diarrhea.

But Frieman says we don’t know yet if the novel coronavirus does the same. Researchers believe COVID-19 uses the same receptor as SARS, and this doorway can be found in your lungs and small intestines.

Two studies—one in the New England Journal of Medicine and one preprint in medRxiv involving 1,099 cases—have also detected the virus in stool samples, which might indicate the virus could spread via feces. But this is far from conclusive.

“Whether that kind of fecal transmission is occuring for this Wuhan virus, we don’t know at all,” Frieman says. “But it definitely looks like it’s there in the stool and it looks like people do have GI symptoms associated with this.”
Blood storm

Coronaviruses can also cause problems in other systems of the body, due to the hyperactive immune response we mentioned earlier.

A 2014 study showed that 92 percent of patients with MERS had at least one manifestation of the coronavirus outside of the lungs. In fact, signs of a full body blitz have been witnessed with all three of the zoonotic coronaviruses: elevated liver enzymes, lower white blood cell and platelet count, and low blood pressure. In rare cases, patients have suffered from acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest.

But this isn’t necessarily a sign that the virus itself is spreading throughout the body, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and associate research scientist at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. It might be a cytokine storm.



Cytokines are proteins used by the immune system as alarm beacons—they recruit immune cells to the site of infection. The immune cells then kill off the infected tissue in a bid to save the rest of the body.

Humans rely on our immune systems to keep their cool when facing a threat. But during a runaway coronavirus infection, when the immune system dumps cytokines into the lungs without any regulation, this culling becomes a free-for-all, Rasmussen says “Instead of shooting at a target with a gun, you’re using a missile launcher,” she says. That’s where the problem arises: Your body is not just targeting the infected cells. It is attacking healthy tissue too.

The implications extend outside the lungs. Cytokine storms create inflammation that weakens blood vessels in the lungs and causes fluid to seep through to the air sacs. “Basically you’re bleeding out of your blood vessels,” Rasmussen says. The storm spills into your circulatory system and creates systemic issues across multiple organs.

From there, things can take a sharp turn for the worse. In some of the most severe COVID-19 cases, the cytokine response—combined with a diminished capacity to pump oxygen to the rest of the body—can result in multi-organ failure. Scientists don’t know exactly why some patients experience complications outside of the lung, but it might be linked to underlying conditions like heart disease or diabetes.

“Even if the virus doesn’t get to kidneys and liver and spleen and other things, it can have clear downstream effects on all of those processes,” Frieman says. And that’s when things can get serious."

**The coronavirus crisis was made in China, but no one will say it**

The Chinese Communist Party calls it ""discourse management"". It's more than mere censorship, and bigger than propaganda. And Beijing is pretty good at it. The party uses it to control its own people, but also to manage foreign governments.

Take the new coronavirus, for instance. It may be a made-in-China global pandemic, and China might have bungled its handling of it, but that's somehow irrelevant and China's government says it's ""unhappy"" with Australia. Come again?

The outbreak is classified by the World Health Organisation as a global health emergency. It was created in China, of course. The consensus among virologists is that the likely cause was the Chinese authorities' persistent tolerance of unsafe animal and food handling practices.

After the 2003 outbreak of a novel coronavirus, the SARS epidemic, the Chinese government banned all trade in wild animals. Once the crisis had passed, the authorities relaxed the ban, announcing 54 types of exemption. In other words, it was going to happen again one day. Then, once this outbreak was discovered, the Chinese authorities seriously mismanaged it. This is now the subject of frenetic blame-shifting inside China.

When the first cases started turning up in the city of Wuhan in mid-December, two weeks before the official disclosure on December 31 that there was a new virus, sick people were turned away from local hospitals and sent home to infect other people and die. The hospitals were told to report ""zero infections"".

Why? Because an important meeting of provincial and city officials was under way in Wuhan and only good news was permitted. The cover-ups and delays were ""reprehensible"" according to an eminent Australian virologist, John Mackenzie.

Famously, eight doctors in Wuhan who tried to raise the alarm before the official announcement were detained by police and ordered to shut up. One, Li Wenliang, caught the virus and died from it, at the age of 34. Dr Li is now considered a martyr in China. Li's last public statement was an appeal for free speech. It has since been censored.

And while Beijing initially was praised for swiftly circulating abroad the vital clinical details of the virus, subsequent revelations show the opposite is true. ""The genome sequence – crucial for rapid development of diagnostics needed in an outbreak response – was not released until January 12, 17 days after the preliminary sequence data were obtained,"" four scientists have concluded in an article in the medical journal The Lancet. The scientists include members of the emergency committee of the World Health Organisation.

Official reporting of the number of people infected has gyrated bizarrely and inexplicably. The delays and cover-ups have made China's people distrustful and fearful. As hundreds of millions lock themselves at home out of fear, the economic cost of the virus mounts. China's President, Xi Jinping, has responded by squarely blaming local officials in Wuhan for the delays and cover-ups.

But the Wuhan authorities, returning the favour, said in an interview on January 27 with the state-owned China Central Television that they were not able to report the virus until authorised by Beijing.

A furious Xi is disciplining local officials. About 400 so far have been punished. Last week, Xi sacked the topmost Communist Party official for the province in which Wuhan is located, Hubei. And Xi's regime has mobilised massively to manage popular opinion. A top-level edict went out in early February instructing Chinese media managers that it was time for ""telling the moving stories of how those on the frontline are preventing and fighting the virus"" and ""showcasing the unity of the Chinese people in the face of the virus"".

The central propaganda authority said it would dispatch 300 propaganda agents – though it called them ""journalists"" – to the ""frontline"" in Hubei to make sure the required happy news stories were supplied.

President Xi has been lauded in headlines like this from one state-owned outlet: ""Following the Example of General Secretary Xi Jinping, For a Loyal and Heroic Struggle for Early Victory."" Catchy, huh?

A noted veteran political commentator, Willy Wo-Lap Lam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, tells me: ""The official state media have glorified Xi as the brilliant and effective man to deal with the outbreak. In actual fact, this is the toughest test of his power since he took over nine years ago. He's accused of not divulging the truth about the virus and the number of casualties, of being too slow to mobilise medical supplies to the affected area, and for the people in the huge province of Hubei being left to their own devices under quarantine, without adequate resources from the central government.""

Lam says that while the media is dripping with ""feelgood and upbeat stories about how we are winning the war against the virus"", it's not convincing many people. ""People do not believe the official version because of the long-standing tradition of the Chinese Communist Party to hide the facts and glorify the supposed achievements of the top leaders. For example they did the same thing in the SARS epidemic. People now see this as playing the SARS trajectory."" In that case, the Chinese authorities covered up the reality of the disease for three years.

So, in a sure sign that Xi feels the need to better deflect blame, a party magazine broke big news on the weekend. It disclosed that Xi had taken personal control of the outbreak response on January 7. This was 13 days earlier than had been known. The Qiushi magazine reported a speech, secret till now, by Xi to his top officials ordering the quarantining of Wuhan, among other things. Why is this significant? To protect him from the criticism that he was too slow to react.

But while it was ""a story intended to be in Xi's self-defence"", says Lam, ""the fact that he mentioned the virus in a closed meeting two weeks before the national mobilisation doesn't help much – you have to tell the public.""

Xi is fighting for his reputation in this titanic episode of ""discourse management"", although his grip on power is not in doubt.

But even as Beijing is struggling with the consequences of so much bungling, so much death, so much damage worldwide, its officials still manage to turn this shocking culpability into an asset in managing the discourse with the wider world.

After the Morrison government decided to protect Australia from the virus by imposing a ban on people travelling from or through China, the Chinese embassy had the gall to complain – wrongly – that the Chinese government hadn't been given advance notice. And to accuse Canberra of an overreaction.

China has imposed draconian bans on its own people, in areas home to some 50 million. Yet Beijing's mouthpiece People's Daily accused other countries that have imposed travel bans of ""racism"". This list would include not only Australia and the US but also Singapore and Japan and Vietnam.

This is preposterous yet somewhat successful ""discourse management"". How so? Because no leader, no official in Australia has had the courage to speak the plain truth to this authoritarian propaganda. No, Beijing, you made this disaster. We are merely trying to survive it.

> SINGAPORE - The Government has assured Buddhist, Taoist, Sikh and Hindu leaders that religious events and worship at temples can continue despite the coronavirus outbreak, but precautionary measures and enhanced personal hygiene must be observed to reduce risks of transmission.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong; Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu; and Education Minister Ong Ye Kung met these religious leaders on Monday (Feb 17) to update them on the coronavirus situation and to provide guidance on precautionary measures.

> Many of the religious leaders shared that they have already put in place several measures to protect worshippers, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth said in a joint statement on the same day.

> In an advisory on Feb 5, the Singapore Buddhist Federation advised Buddhist temples and followers to reduce or scale down indoor or outdoor religious gatherings and cancel such activities where necessary to reduce the potential spread of the virus.

> Since then, the federation has also cancelled religious classes on Sundays and talks, as well as the Thousand-Buddha Dharma Assembly that was originally scheduled for March 1.

> The Hindu Endowments Board had also set up thermal scanners and additional hand-washing points for the Thaipusam procession earlier this month.

> Participants of the procession were also told to move briskly and not gather in groups, and to leave the temple after completing their vows instead of congregating.

> Meanwhile, public mass for Roman Catholics here have been suspended indefinitely from noon since last Saturday, and several large Christian churches have also suspended services.

> The National Council of Churches of Singapore said in a letter on its website on Feb 8 that churches here will continue to provide worship services, but advised those who are unwell to stay home, as they would be denied entry.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Grace Assembly of God services suspended but members using tech to pray and stay in touch

> Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far

> Churches here will also be introducing control measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus, such as temperature screening, ventilating their premises and having enough hand-washing facilities, as well as more frequent cleaning, the council added.

> Two clusters of coronavirus cases in Singapore have been connected to religious groups here - one linked to The Life Church and Missions, and one to the Grace Assembly of God church, the largest cluster here.

> The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) has also encouraged Muslims attending prayers at mosques to take their own mats and to avoid shaking hands to minimise contact.

> On Monday, the ministers highlighted the role of social responsibility in reducing the risk of transmission and that those who are unwell should consult a doctor immediately and avoid going to religious events or places of worship.

> Additional measures such as increasing the frequency of cleaning commonly used areas and minimising sharing of common items, as well as having good ventilation at venues where large events are held, were also shared by MOH.

Protective masks were not.

Not only did Prime Minister Hun Sen not wear one, assured that the ship was virus-free, his bodyguards ordered people who had donned masks to take them off. The next day, the American ambassador to Cambodia, W. Patrick Murphy, who brought his own family to greet the passengers streaming off the ship, also went maskless.

“We are very, very grateful that Cambodia has opened literally its ports and doors to people in need,” Mr. Murphy said.

But after hundreds of passengers had disembarked, one later tested positive for the coronavirus. Now, health officials worry that what Cambodia opened its doors to was the outbreak, and that the world may pay a price as passengers from the cruse ship Westerdam stream home.

Before the Westerdam docked in Sihanoukville, fearful governments in other countries had turned the ship away at five ports of call even though the cruise operator, Holland America, assured officials that the ship’s passengers had been carefully screened.

Prime Minister Hun Sen’s decision to allow it entry appeared to be a political calculus as much as anything else. The region’s longest-serving ruler and a close ally of China, he is known for his survival skills.

But Mr. Hun Sen’s critics worry that the aging autocrat might have acted rashly.

“Of course, he had to do the dictator thing: photo op, roses, exploit this for its maximum value,” said Sophal Ear, an expert in Cambodian politics at Occidental College. “Whatever is in the best interest of Cambodians is completely irrelevant to him.”


It is too early to tell whether the decision to let hundreds of passengers from the Westerdam fly off has the makings of an epidemiological disaster. Cambodian health authorities said that 409 of the 2,257 passengers and crew had left Cambodia for their homes scattered across the globe. The rest remain in hotels in Phnom Penh, the capital, or on the ship.


But deficiencies in screening for the coronavirus aboard the ship, along with continued complacency about the epidemic in Cambodia, are raising fears this small Southeast Asian nation could prove to be a surprising vector of transmission for a virus that has already killed more than 1,700 people, mostly in China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Many health experts urge people who have been in contact with coronavirus patients to self-quarantine for 14 days, lest they add another spoke to the contagion network.

But on Monday, Mr. Hun Sen directed officials in Phnom Penh to treat passengers from the Westerdam to a sightseeing jaunt.

“To tour the city is better than staying in rooms or at the hotel feeling bored or scared,” said a post on Mr. Hun Sen’s Facebook page.

The lack of urgency in Cambodia, where officials milled around the ship on Monday without protection, points to the obstacles in trying to contain a virus that experts warn is spreading faster than SARS or MERS.

“This is influenza-like transmission,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “It’s like trying to stop the wind.”

Last week, when the Westerdam docked in Sihanoukville, the Cambodian government and the cruise operator deemed the vessel virus-free.

The declaration was at a minimum premature.

Only 20 people out of the 2,257 onboard were tested for the virus before disembarking, and that was because they had reported themselves to ship medical staff with various ailments.

The woman who twice tested positive after traveling on to Malaysia, an 83-year-old American, was not among those 20, Holland America said.

Health monitoring for the rest of the passengers was limited to a handful of temperature checks conducted with infrared thermometers, passengers said. In a statement, Holland America said that during one of those screenings, not a single person on board recorded an elevated temperature.

On Monday, an announcement broadcast to passengers remaining on the Westerdam warned that they should avoid the ship’s hot deck and return to their air-conditioned rooms to avoid falsely high temperature readings.

Some health experts have questioned the efficacy of infrared thermometers, also known as temperature guns, saying they measure the heat emanating from the surface of the body, rather than core body temperature.

Various environmental factors can distort thermometer gun reading, said Gary Strahan, who runs a small infrared device company in Texas.

“In Cambodia, you have warmer background temperatures,” he said. “It could impact the measurement. That’s the issue with any noncontact thermometer.”

Even if temperatures are accurately gauged, people may be taking medication that lower their temperature, like some arthritis drugs.

And in any case, people who are asymptomatic can still pass on the coronavirus, scientists have found.

“A person who does not present as feverish is not necessarily uninfected with a disease or a virus,” said Jim Seffrin, an expert on infrared devices at the Infraspection Institute in New Jersey.

In the wake of the positive test in Malaysia, Cambodian health officials said they would be relying on a domestic lab to test all passengers and crew members still in the country for the coronavirus.

On Monday evening, passengers celebrated news from Cambodian health officials that a first batch of 406 people in Phnom Penh had tested negative, although there was no certainty they would not later test positive.

“People on the ship are very grateful to the people of Cambodia,” said Tammie Graves, an American from Kansas. “I was a bit worried that they might be afraid of us, even at the hotel, but it hasn’t been like that at all.”

On Monday afternoon, more than 100 Westerdam passengers took up Mr. Hun Sen’s offer of a capital tour, piling in buses to see the royal palace and other sites.

In pictures of the excursion, posted on a government-linked website, only one person can be seen wearing a mask.

Despite cases of coronavirus popping up in Southeast Asia, Mr. Hun Sen has campaigned against masks, arguing that they are better at spreading fear than stopping germs. At a news conference last month, he announced that he would kick out anyone who dared wear a mask.

Even as other governments instituted China travel bans that angered Beijing, Mr. Hun Sen traveled to the Chinese capital and met with Xi Jinping, China’s leader, in another photo op.

And as other countries organized airlifts of people trapped in Wuhan, the city where the virus is believed to have originated, Mr. Hun Sen said he would not ferry Cambodian students home because they should be “joining with Chinese to fight this disease.”

The sense of solidarity makes sense in a country heavily dependent on China for its fortunes, after having turned its back on a West that was demanding progress in human rights in return for aid and investment.

A torrent of Chinese cash has remade Cambodia, nowhere more so than in Sihanoukville, a once sleepy beach town that is now a sprawling construction site of gilded casinos and towering residential blocks. More than 90 percent of businesses in the city are now Chinese owned.

On Monday, Oeun Yen, a masseuse here, worried about the massages she had given three female passengers from the Westerdam before the virus case was confirmed by Malaysia. She was not afraid at first, she said, because the prime minister had assured people all was fine.

“Now I am more concerned,” she said.

In a country where Mr. Hun Sen has dissolved the biggest opposition party and political assassination is not uncommon, such mild concern is as much as many ordinary residents are willing to muster.

But there is also widespread skepticism of the government’s contention that only one person in Cambodia has so far tested positive for coronavirus, a Chinese citizen who has since returned home.

“There is a natural lack of credibility and trust associated with the Cambodian government,” said Ou Virak, a human-rights activist and founder of the Future Forum, a local think tank. “This is Hun Sen’s Westerdam problem, because even if he was doing the right thing, purely as a humanitarian, he will be seen as the puppet of China instead.”

On Monday, Mr. Hun Sen announced yet another publicity stunt: He wants to invite the passengers of the Westerdam to a party.

Masks won’t be welcome.

Q: Am I at risk for COVID-19 from a package or products shipping from China?

A: There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website as it becomes available. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"

I am not, it's not just China though, the global economy faces massive challenges for a number of reasons. Coronavirus becomes more of a factor every day, but outside of that climate change and the China v America trade war are hurting all nations.

Trump has weakened America's soft-power, which will only force it to increasingly rely on tariffs and its military to exert influence.

China has had massive issues with corruption, specifically, similarly to the US pre-2008, banks giving out massive loans that will never be repaid. China's debt is massive and every day China's central government are discovering more and more banks who have been hiding the amount of debt they hold. This has resulted in repeated bad headlines within China going on two years now, which has caused a level of discontent (maybe incorrectly) directed at Beijing.

The protests in Hong Kong and now the mishandling of the viral outbreak are not pushing things in a direction Xi would like, we've already seen some rioting in China during this outbreak. I can guarantee you have not seen the end of unrest in China."

2020-02-17,n1ght_w1ng08,technology,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/f5kmnz/apple_cuts_revenue_forecast_as_coronavirus_wreaks/fhz97bb/,"Full Text :

The phone maker shut down factories and shops due to the epidemic, but is now seeing 'a slower return to normal conditions than anticipated'

Apple has warned investors that it will miss its revenue forecast for this spring due to the devastating impact of coronavirus on the Chinese economy. 

The company had previously said that it expected to report net sales of between $63bn (£48bn) and $67bn in the three months ending this June, a wider than usual range that it blamed on ""uncertainty ""over the epidemic.

But late on Monday, in a letter to investors, Apple admitted that it would miss even those targets because the disease had strangled the supply of new iPhones and crushed customer demand as it forced the company to shut down factories and closed high street shops.

It is the second time in the last 13 months that Apple has had to cut its forecasts due to problems in China, where it makes most of its products and more than one tenth of its revenue. The company did not give any new predicted numbers.

The letter said: ""Our quarterly guidance issued on January 28, 2020 reflected the best information available at the time,  as well as our best estimates about the pace of return to work following the end of the extended Chinese New Year holiday on February 10.

""Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter...

""Our first priority – now and always – is the health and safety of our employees, supply chain partners, customers and the communities in which we operate. Our profound gratitude is with those on the front lines of confronting this public health emergency.""

The company went on to say that while its iPhone factories have now reopened, they are ""ramping up more slowly than anticipated"", causing an iPhone shortage that will ""temporarily affect revenues worldwide"".

According to reports, Foxconn, one of Apple's main suppliers, does not expect even half of its factories to be running again until the end of February, although the company has denied that claim.

Meanwhile, the letter said, all Apple Stores and many authorised third party shops have closed, and those that remain open ""have been operating at reduced hours and with very low customer traffic"" as consumers hole up indoors to avoid infection.

Apple's letter insisted that the disruption would be short-term, concluding: ""Outside of China, customer demand across our product and service categories has been strong to date and in line with our expectations... Apple is fundamentally strong, and this disruption to our business is only temporary.""

Coronavirus has infected more than 70,000 people and killed more than 1,770 since it began spreading among humans in the Chinese province of Hubei, causing the World Health Organisation to declare an international emergency. Cases have sprung up in numerous other countries including Britain, the US, India, France, Russia and Egypt.

The pneumonia-like disease has hobbled the Chinese economy, with many workplaces closed, large areas under quarantine, international flights frozen and shortages of components ripple out through the many complex supply chains which extend from China's manufacturing sector all over the world.

Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said: ""It's a shock to the system. It confirms the worst fears about just how impacted Apple and its supply chain has been by coronavirus outbreak... I think it's the first company of many that could go down this path because of the disruption.""

He said that although Apple had proven its ""credibility"" in the past by accurately predicting temporary problems, the cancelling of previous revenue guidance ""speaks to just how significant this outbreak is"".

In an analyst's note, he added that although the size of the impact was ""clearly worse than feared"", he remained bullish about Apple's stock, arguing that the virus was unlikely to cause long-term problems for the company.

According to the Washington Post, the Chinese provinces most stricken by the virus are host to almost 50,000 branches or subsidiaries of foreign corporations. A total of around 60m people are now under quarantine, almost as many people as the whole population of the UK.

Apple also pledged to double its donations to the fight against the virus. "

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China caused an eventual 8,098 cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in 17 countries (9.6% fatality rate), with the majority of cases in mainland China and Hong Kong.  No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004. In late 2017, Chinese scientists traced the virus through the intermediary of civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in Yunnan province.

Wet markets with live and dead animals  sold for food/meat are pointed as a possible way transmission  happened

I've also seen social article  on chinese food habits (eg bat soup) and  the counter posts calling  that racist and  incorrect

A widespread endemic disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further, flu pandemics generally exclude recurrences of seasonal flu. Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as smallpox and tuberculosis.

Sharing the source would help covince us, or help us see if maybe something was misunderstood. For example, if I were to show you a photo of the dragon in my basement, you could easily tell me that it was photoshopped because it's a picture of spyro. 

The article you shared is a study on several coronavirus strains, but was not conducted on covid-19. The researchers *expect* the same to apply to covid-19, but they did not conduct a study on it.

Examples:  ""Throughout those two vital weeks—time when aggressive control efforts [might have stopped](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/02/01/early-missteps-state-secrecy-china-likely-allowed-coronavirus-spread-farther-faster/) the outbreak—the virus was spreading completely independently from the animal market .""

 ""But by Feb. 3, there was [evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/health/coronavirus-symptoms-germany.html) that people who had no fevers, only mild forms of coronavirus illness, could pass the virus to others. ""

If it were bioengineered, there would be vaccines, political leaders out in full force because they already had immunity and are trying to downplay the lethality. There would be guilt ridden whistleblowers with dead family and nothing else to lose. There would be early outbreak clusters of friends and family of those who worked in labs.

&#x200B;

1. The Dutch public health authorities had it classified as an 'animal to human virus' for days after the German cases started popping up. Do examples like this make you understand we do not trust our public health authorities that you personally advise us to trust? 

2. How come that the WHO advises medical professionals to wear a mask if they are within 2 meters of a possible influenza patient, but only advises a spatial separation of over 1 meter for **suspected** 2019nCoV patients without PPE? (Source: [https://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus\_infections/InterimGuidance\_ClinicalManagement\_NovelCoronavirus\_11Feb13u.pdf](https://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/InterimGuidance_ClinicalManagement_NovelCoronavirus_11Feb13u.pdf))

Does the WHO think that the seasonal influenza is less contagious than 2019nCoV? Can you understand that inconsistencies like this eat away the public's trust in organizations like the WHO? Would it not be better to err on the side of caution when instructing your medical professionals on protective measures? 

3. The Chinese authorities made masks obligatory, whereas most of our western authorities say hand washing should suffice. Will there be enough masks once the west (which has no mask wearing tradition) decides masks will be necessary? Might the advice to not wear masks stem from a lack of masks in the west? Is the WHO doing anything in communion with governments and factories to ramp up mask production? 

4. Why is the WHO actively promoting censorship through Facebook etc.? Most new information that our public health authorities brought forward has been available for days or weeks on the internet. Weirdly, the only example of good and open government communication comes from Singapore. Is there a chance that our governments are less open than Singapore because they want to protect the economy? 

5. I understand the virus will run it's course no matter what. But do you agree that delaying the spread will give the population a chance to prepare and, combined with the development of new medication (or re-purposing of old medication), give us a higher chance of survival. If so, what do you think of daily flights from China still coming into Europe. Is this not putting economic interests above the population's health? Should the WHO advise us in order to stop panic, or advise in the interest of the public's health, no matter what the consequences to the economy? 

6. If we follow the official numbers, 20% gravely ill (the WHO describes this as symptoms of severe pneunomia) and an R0 of 2.6 (Imperial College), then we can expect a similar situation to Wuhan in every hospital in the world. The public knows this, but the picture this paints is not being painted by our governments or by the WHO. Do you understand that we do not trust our governments or the WHO if they do not acknowledge that we might have an insanely serious problem on our hands? And that the questions this problem raises are not answered (and seem not to be taken serious)? 

7. Do you agree that the WHO should have declared this a global emergency the moment they had the knowledge of an R0 of 2.6 (Imperial College), 20% gravely ill (WHO) and 1-2% deaths (Imperial College) with a good functioning health system, but in Hubei a death rate of 18% (Imperial College). Would you agree that if our health systems collapse, we could expect a similar death rate to Hubei? If not, what's different between the west and Hubei? 

8. Also, the R0 in countries that are a bit more open about the locations and spread of their cases and do a good job of tracking contacts (Singapore, UK) seems a lot higher than 2.6. Up till now we call all this the result of super spreaders. But how many super spreaders can you explain away until you have to accept that this virus might just super spread? 

9. Will the WHO apologize once deaths hit 30 million? Who can we hold accountable? We live in democracies and we expect openness. We want to be able to hold accountable those who are in charge of our wellbeing.

 I think we can all accept that we do not have enough medicine, oxygen, hospital space etc. for a global pandemic. And there are ways to work with that. By smartly allocating medicine production, by preparing the population, by putting our minds together and for this we need total openness. But the population might become very angry if this is covered up. The WHO should not aid in this, if that is the case. 

Praising China for their reaction might work politically, but it does not logically combine with advising the westerners not to wear face masks, not to stop flights, not to quarantine areas. Either China overreacts, or we under react. Both cannot be true. Censoring social media does not stop us from seeing that. 

10. Do you understand that open communication might defeat the need for censorship of social media? The public wants to know what their governments and WHO like organizations are doing to prevent or treat the virus. For example: 

11. *There is a fair chance that Remdesivir can be used to treat the worst cases. How much Remdesivir is there at the moment. Is there already a ramp up in production in case the trials in China will have favorable results? How much will we be able to produce in what time-span? Will the EU approve use of Remdesivir? Is there even Remdesivir in the EU? How much oxygen is there available for hospitals? How much is being produced? Are we ramping up production? Are hospitals preparing isolation wards? If so, what type? Similar to the Chinese types where just beds and food are provided? How many assisted breathing apparatus are there? How does this compare to 20% severely ill patients (WHO estimate) that will be infected by 2019nCoV? Are we producing more of these apparatus? How many can be produced in what timespan? Will my government approve the use of X medication for compassionate use? Do our countries have enough antibiotics to fight secundare infections? Are we ramping up the production of Kaletra already, just in case it proves to save lifes?*

These types of questions need to be answered in my mind, and once that is done there will not be a need for censorship of social media, as people will not have to go looking for information by non-official sources.

12. How come there is no investigation in the laboratory theory? The chance of the outbreak starting within 20 kilometers of China's **only** level-4 biolab, known for it's coronavirus research, is tiny. China is 10 million square kilometers big, so the chance of it happening right there is 1 in hundreds of thousands. Lottery chances or higher. Did China win the lottery so to speak? I understand that not much changes in how we need to tackle this if it did in fact escape, but can we stop censoring media and people that bring up this coincidence? If it escaped, we should learn from this and not cover it up. The least we could do is double check to make sure. 

13. Since the governments around the world are becoming more and more unified through unions and organizations like the WHO and UN, will this be our future? Praise for governments that hide information, fudging of numbers, information consumable to the public that is decided on in private meetings by big committees (Like American states not reporting the exact location of cases, but just showing numbers in counts that keep going up and up, with a population that can only guess)? Contradictory facts that we need to accept, the censoring of 'unofficial information'? Is this our future? 

14. Is this AMA your personal idea or has it come up in WHO-meetings that WHO scientists should take to social media? If so, why did they send you, a food safety scientist? Could it be so that you can not answer the most dire questions whilst still being open about your expertise (food safety, as opposed to virology)? And therefore the WHO cannot be accused of misinformation or underestimation and pretend to be open? 

In case you answer, thanks, I'm genuinely curious!"

2020-02-17,funtrippykitty,collapse,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/f52uqk/the_coronavirus_has_completely_taken_the_oil/fhx42ah/,"New York (CNN Business)The rapidly-spreading coronavirus in China poses the biggest demand threat to the oil market since the 2008 financial crisis. Yet OPEC and Russia can't agree on a rescue plan.
Saudi Arabia, seeking to cushion the blow from the coronavirus, proposed further production cuts during three days of meetings in Vienna this week. But Russia is pushing back -- even though fears about the coronavirus have sent oil prices crashing into yet another bear market.
The Russians said ""they need more time"" to weigh recommendations from the group's technical committee and assess the impact of the coronavirus on the market, a source close to the negotiations told CNN Business' John Defterios.

The coronavirus has clobbered oil prices because it is destroying demand in China, the world's largest oil importer and the epicenter of global oil demand growth. The crisis has killed more than 560 people, infected over 28,000 and brought large parts of the world's second-largest economy to a standstill.
The compromise proposal from Saudi Arabia was to cut oil production by 600,000 barrels per day, down from 800,000 to 1 million barrels, a senior OPEC source confirmed to CNN.
The apparent conflict between OPEC and Russia dashes hopes that the group will be able to arrest the sharp decline in prices.
""The coronavirus has completely taken the oil market hostage,"" said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. ""The market is watching what OPEC does with bated breath. If OPEC is not able to stick the landing, it will have a big psychological hit to the market.""
US oil prices retreated to around $50.70 a barrel on the news. Crude had climbed as high as $52.20 on Thursday on hopes of a strong OPEC response. S&P Global Platts Analytics said earlier this week it was reasonable to expect a 1 million barrel per day production cut by OPEC.
Earlier this week, oil plunged into a bear market, signifying a 20% decline from previous highs. Crude closed at a 13-month low of $49.61 on Tuesday.
Oil demand in 'free fall'
Unlike recent oil tailspins, this one has been triggered by demand destruction, not excess supply. And demand shocks can be more challenging to stop because of the uncertainty involved.
""What we're facing now is a different beast. Demand is just in free fall,"" said Tran.
In a best-case scenario, oil demand will tumble by 1.5 million barrels per day in February, according to Platts. The worst-case scenario by the firm calls for demand to plunge by 4 million barrels per day.
Most concerning for oil bulls, the appetite for jet fuel has cratered because major airlines including American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and British Airways have suspended all flights to and from mainland China.
Daily flight cancellations are approaching nearly 3,000, according to RBC, which is using artificial intelligence to track real-time flight patterns. China's Sinopec has slashed its overall crude throughput by about 13% and its refineries are operating in China at minimum run rates, according to Platts.
""This is, in our opinion, the most acute threat to global demand since the financial crisis of 2008,"" said Tran.
Will Saudi Arabia act alone?
Demand for oil has been relatively resilient in the years since the Great Recession, boosted by the rapid economic growth in China and India. Previous demand shocks include the Sept. 11 terror attacks and the SARS infection of 2003.
It's unclear what OPEC will do next.

Under new Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, the kingdom has signaled it would prefer not to act alone anymore. Saudi Arabia would prefer that other major oil players, including Russia, help shoulder the burden of production cuts.
OPEC must now decide if wishes to act alone, without the support of Russia. Such a move could jeopardize the OPEC+ alliance that has worked well in recent years to put a floor beneath weak oil prices."

 avenida Faria Lima.

 “Se for pra curtir, curta com consciência. Se for pra paquerar, que seja com respeito. Caso alguém se sinta assediado, pode procurar o posto médico da prefeitura”, afirmou.

 O músico também interrompeu a apresentação e pediu ao público colaboração para que a festa continuasse.

  “Vamos vaiar esse pessoal que tá brigando. Aqui é paz e amor. Não precisa disso”, disse Alok. A galera gritou e a confusão foi encerrada.

 “A prefeitura está preocupada porque ainda tem muita gente chegando. Preciso que vocês me ajudem, quero muito continuar essa festa”, continuou.

 No dia anterior, a cantora Elba Ramalho pediu aos foliões: “Respeita as minas”. Também no sábado, a administradora Luka Borges, 30, subiu ao palco antes do início do batuque do Sargento Pimenta para dar o recado do coletivo “Não é Não”, que neste ano distribui em 15 estados tatuagens temporárias contra o assédio.

 No domingo, a atriz Alessandra Negrini, do bloco Baixo Augusta, aproveitou a festa para protestar. Vestida de índia, fez referência às críticas de Bolsonaro aos indígenas.

 Ela estava acompanhada da [ativista](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/08/sonia-guajajara-vice-de-boulos-usa-nome-indigena-com-amparo-da-legislacao.shtml) Sônia Guajajara, que foi candidata a vice-presidente na chapa de   
 Guilherme Boulos (PSOL).

 “Hoje para mim a questão indígena é a central desse país. Ela envolve não somente a preservação da cultura deles como a preservação das nossas matas. A luta indígena é de todos nós e por isso eu tive a ousadia de me vestir assim”, disse à **Folha**.

 A ativista indígena Sônia Guajajara defendeu o visual com adereços indígenas adotado pela atriz.

 “Muita gente usa acessórios indígenas como fantasia. Isso a gente não concorda. Mas quando a pessoa usa de uma forma consciente, como um manifesto para amplificar as vozes indígenas então tudo bem, é compreensível”, disse.

 Segundo ela, Alessandra Negrini havia combinado o protesto com o grupo de indígenas que participou do bloco.

 Do alto do trio do Baixo Augusta, um dos integrantes puxou o coro: “ei, Bolsonaro, vai tomar no c.”. O chamado foi acompanhado pela multidão que lotava a rua da Consolação.

 As fantasias também foram usadas como forma de protesto. A comunicadora Nayara Sampaio, 34, misturou peixe e óleo em sua roupa Confraria do Pasmado neste domingo, em referência às manchas nas praias nordestinas. 

 Ao lado de Bolsonaro, o secretário de Aquicultura e Pesca, Jorge Seif Júnior, disse que as pessoas poderiam continuar consumindo pescados. 

 A explicação: “O peixe é um bicho inteligente. Quando ele vê uma mancha de óleo ali, capitão, ele foge, ele tem medo”, afirmou o secretário. 

 “É uma piada pronta”, diz Nayara, que é mineira, mas vive em São Paulo.

 Outra crítica ao governo Bolsonaro na área ambiental foi feita por um grupo de amigos paulistanos. Eles se fantasiaram de Amazônia devastada, inclusive com uma Greta Thunberg, a ativista sueca defensora do clima chamada de pirralha pelo presidente.

 No fim do domingo, [cinco pessoas foram baleadas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/02/cinco-pessoas-sao-baleadas-durante-pre-carnaval-na-zona-sul-de-sp.shtml) na av. Luís Carlos Berrini, no Brooklin (zona sul) após a passagem de blocos.

The passengers were among more than 300 Americans aboard a cruise ship that was been quarantined in Yokohama for more than 10 days. United States officials initially said they would not allow infected people to board the evacuation flights, but appeared to reverse that decision early Monday."

I assume BC and Ontario are probably very similar to Alberta in criteria now (as the BC criteria was last updated a few weeks ago, so maybe outdated now) - but even if they aren't, as I mentioned above, there is still physician discretion. Even the systems that you claim are much better (US, UK, etc.) have a lot of the same issues, especially given how fragmented the US system is (many private providers, Medicare providers, Medicaid providers, Veterans Affairs providers, etc.). Even if you develop perfect criteria in DC, the practical on-the-ground implementation may be much different. 

My argument is that there is a point in which excessive testing has diminishing returns. Testing isn't perfect - there may be false negatives, but there can also be false positives. It may result in quarantining someone unnecessarily, or giving them a false sense of security. Screening symptomatic individuals from China seems reasonable as this is where the vast majority of cases are as the pre-test probability is higher. Outside of China, you're more likely to see non-coronavirus causes of cold/flu symptoms."

Countries have been aggressively quarantining incoming travelers. However, I've been following the News Now headlines, and it's clear that there are failures, from a woman escaping quarantine, to another misdiagnosed, to examples of symptoms appearing after the two week quarantine period (which was, afaik, based on a \*different\* virus).

AFAIK, Within the US, the virus is only reported voluntarily at hospitals. So I'm wondering what happens when homeless people, or those without health insurance, catch it. Several cities will have their Lunar New Year parade, exposing wealthy travelers who have been carrying the virus (but have access to health care) to those who do not. I did post about five major US cities that are developing facilities specifically to combat the virus, but who knows how long that will take.

Shanghai, which has been hit hard by the virus, is actually considering maintenance, rather than containment, of the virus, much as the we treat the influenza virus. That is, live with it, and only treat the worst cases. Personally, I don't think the virus itself is as bad as some think, but we still need to treat it -- and the influenza virus -- seriously.

A mathematical model set up by an ad-hoc group of scientists indicates the number of currently infected novel coronavirus cases in China began a pattern of decline as of February 12. Currently infected cases are those confirmed to be ill with the virus who have not yet recovered or died.

When the model’s data was updated February 13 as the result of a change in Hubei province’s reporting, the model’s predicted date for the start of the decline jumped back.

“Before, our model indicated the decline would not start until February 16,” says Dr Yi Zou, who is based in the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.

Even if a few virus particles did make their way out it'd still be highly unlikely that they could actually infect someone.

Also this not a SARS Virus even though it belongs to the same family. Creating a new functioning virus is harder than you think it is, even if you already have a template.

Plus Coronavirus is an RNA virus so the mutation rate is very high. It's very likely it just evolved to infect humans in an enviroment where humans live in close contact, not in an isolated lab."

[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/wuhan-seafood-market-may-not-be-source-novel-virus-spreading-globally](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/wuhan-seafood-market-may-not-be-source-novel-virus-spreading-globally)

>Their data also show that, in total, 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace.

the  wuhan seafood foodmarket that was reported on the news was not the  source of  the  infection for many of the people who were originally  found to have  been  infected in december. some speculate that the  initial infection probably started around november.

the  2019-cnov, coronavirus, did not come directly from bats. according to  this article looking at the genome of the virus it's clear that there was an intermediary host which I spculate means a primate host.  I don't believe they sold primates at the wuhan seafood market. **civets  and racoon dogs are sold there but they are known to be just carriers of  diseases vs the actual source of the disease.** I believe they theorized that sars came from civets and that mers came from camels. but I believe many scientists are now convinced that these animales were just carriers of the diseases and not the species for which the virus jumped from and mutated and then jumped to humans. so these animals caught it from the actual intermediate species or a human. 

[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/mining-coronavirus-genomes-clues-outbreak-s-origins](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/mining-coronavirus-genomes-clues-outbreak-s-origins)

so  a lot of the speculations regarding bats and other animals are  misleading as yes, bats carry many versions of the coronavirus but they  are versions of the virus that no human can ever catch. the non-primate  animals like civets and racoon dogs can only carry the actual 2019-ncov  virus only after catching it from a human or primate who had it.

so the real question should be how or where did it go from bats to possibly a primate and then mutated enough where a human can catch it? 

monkeys are known to eat bats."

A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan,  Hubei Province,China, in December 2019 and has caused over 40,000 cases worldwide to date.Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold anddry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spreadof droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute hu-midity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). How-ever, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yetbeen  established.   Here,  we  examine  province-level  variability  of  the  basicreproductive  numbers  of  COVID-19  across  China  and  find  that  changes  inweather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and sum-mer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to de-clines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive publichealth interventions."

What I am worried about most, however, is our medic front-liners. The Hospital Authority said they have 3-month PPE stock in early January and I believe they haven't received their January or February batch of PPE delivery, hence the shortage and **urging their staff to re-use the masks**.

Even now Intels 10nm process shows to have lower yields than AMD’s 7nm process, and I’m sure they don’t want 2 bottlenecks (coronavirus and Intel)

iMac or iMac Pro would be my next guess. iMac to bring more power for less (This IS Apple’s mainstream desktop, not the Mac mini or Mac Pro), or the iMac Pro to make the price more comparable to a Mac Pro or even the current gen iMac ($5,000 for the same 2017 spec)

1, A doctor’s general description of symptoms for the Covid’s first three weeks of illness.

2. A day by day description of symptoms and treatment for the first patient in the USA.


Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: 

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.”


2. And, this:

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

Not sure you are being that accurate since the issue wasn’t what to call the virus vs what to call the specific disease.  It was why are they banning the term coronavirus.  My response was they must like the term Covid-19 better.  I guess you specificity means they will only allow SARS-COV-2 (dashes and all) and not coronavirus or covid19 (apparently too unspecific) or SARS cov 2 (no dashes and cov not capitalized and this not specific).

Another part of it is probably people seeing others panicking, and then starting to panic themselves without really knowing anything about the virus or its symptoms. Also, influenza feels more preventable, I think. You can get the flu shot and feel more protected, and it's something that most people have dealt with at some point and recovered just fine, so it doesn't feel very scary compared to this new unknown thing that's being sensationalized by the news.

Also, I don't think it's that relevant that influenza kills way more people every year because a) it's way more common than the coronavirus and b) the coronavirus likely has a higher mortality rate which I think is a more important statistic. It's important to note though that we can't really know for sure what the mortality rate is right now since it's an ongoing epidemic."

Phnom Penh Governor Khuong Sreng on the afternoon of February 17, 2020 brings tourists from the Westerdam cruise ship to Sihanoukville for a tour of major tourist destinations in Phnom Penh, especially to see the development. Of Cambodia.

Mean Chan Yada, deputy governor of Phnom Penh Capital, said that 120 tourists from various nationalities came from different countries.

Locations where the authorities take tourists for a tour include the front of the Royal Palace, the riverside and other attractions before they return to the Sokha Hotel. After all, the tour will end at 6pm, giving tourists the chance to get off the Westerdam at the Sokha Hotel.

Mean Chan Yada claims to organize this trip so that all foreign tourists are aware of the development of Phnom Penh, the heart of Cambodia.

During the welcoming remarks of Westerdam's shipwrecked tourists at the port of Sihanoukville after six countries and islands denied the pneumonia virus caused by the coronavirus, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said yesterday. February 14, 2020 announced that the cruise ship will be free in the country. Country without fear.

Samdech Techo Hun Sen also appealed to the Cambodian people, especially hoteliers, not to worry about the infection of tourists in the big ship, as health officials are already paying close attention."

 Em apenas duas semanas, o deputado mostrou que manterá o protagonismo sobre a pauta econômica, capitaneando as discussões sobre as [reformas tributária](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painelsa/2020/02/empresarios-protestam-contra-reforma-tributaria-da-camara.shtml) e [administrativa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/governo-avalia-desistir-de-pec-da-reforma-administrativa.shtml).

 Maia também vem deixando claro que tem poder para dificultar a vida do governo em algumas situações. 

 É o caso da desavença com o [ministro Abraham Weintraub](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/01/rixa-com-maia-expoe-dificuldade-de-weintraub-na-relacao-com-a-camara.shtml) (Educação), que resultou na perda de validade da [medida provisória](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2019/09/bolsonaro-assina-no-final-da-semana-mp-que-esvazia-carteirinha-de-entidades-estudantis.shtml) que trata da carteirinha digital estudantil, com a qual o governo gastou R$ 2,5 milhões em publicidade.

 As alfinetadas de Maia ao governo começaram já no discurso durante a sessão solene de abertura dos trabalhos. Nele, Maia frisou a independência do Parlamento. ""O Congresso está passando a ocupar um lugar que é seu por direito, como epicentro do debate e da negociação"", disse.

  O presidente da Câmara também reafirmou a importância do[ Orçamento impositivo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/orcamento-impositivo-pode-levar-a-paralisia-da-maquina-publica.shtml), mudança constitucional aprovada em 2019 que engessou o poder do Executivo sobre os gastos do governo.

 ""Pela primeira vez, temos um instrumento que garante que as decisões do Congresso nortearão de fato o emprego dos recursos públicos"", afirmou.

 No Planalto, a avaliação é a de que Bolsonaro ensaiou uma aproximação com Maia. Um desses acenos foi a decisão de colocar[ Rogério Marinho](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/bolsonaro-substitui-canuto-por-rogerio-marinho-no-desenvolvimento-regional.shtml), ex-secretário especial de Previdência e Trabalho, à frente do Ministério do Desenvolvimento Regional.

 Mas a movimentação pode ter perdido força com a [nomeação de mais um militar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/bolsonaro-indica-general-que-liderou-intervencao-no-rj-para-a-casa-civil.shtml) sem traquejo político para um posto de articulação no Planalto, como é a Casa Civil.

 A escolha de [Walter Braga Netto](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/02/planalto-esta-apreensivo-com-reacoes-do-congresso-a-indicacao-de-braga-netto.shtml) incomodou os parlamentares, que estão ameaçando travar pautas de interesse do governo como retaliação. 

 Para eles, a sinalização que o governo passa é que ""nenhum político presta"". Em resposta, eles cogitam bloquear as propostas do Planalto para lembrar que o Executivo precisa do Legislativo para governar. 

 Além disso, a pauta econômica, a que mais avançou no ano passado e que tem dois pilares importantes a serem votados neste ano --as reformas tributária e administrativa ---, deve ficar prejudicada em razão das [declarações controversas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/articulacao-falha-e-verborragia-de-guedes-ameacam-agenda-economica.shtml) do ministro Paulo Guedes (Economia) na última semana.

 Em sete dias, o ministro conseguiu provocar reações inflamadas ao chamar [funcionários públicos de parasitas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/o-cara-virou-um-parasita-diz-guedes-sobre-servidores.shtml) e ao dizer que o dólar alto é bom porque “[era] todo mundo indo para a Disneylândia, empregada doméstica indo para a Disneylândia, [uma festa danada](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/domestica-ia-para-disney-com-dolar-barato-diz-guedes-uma-festa-danada.shtml)”.

 Depois do desgaste, dizem os parlamentares, a chance de uma reforma administrativa ser aprovada só existe se o texto for costurado por Maia. 

 O presidente da Câmara vem demonstrando irritação com a imobilidade do governo em relação às duas reformas. ""Não tenho culpa se o governo ainda não mandou a reforma administrativa"", disse em 30 de janeiro, quando questionado sobre as prioridades do ano.

 Na quarta-feira (12), ele voltou a ironizar o Executivo. Quando uma repórter o indagou sobre o prometido envio pelo governo das [regras do funcionalismo público](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/03/novas-regras-para-servidor-sao-alvo-de-criticas.shtml), respondeu: “Disse que ia, né? Estamos aguardando”.

 Se, por enquanto, não se pode falar em derrotas concretas do governo na Câmara, um dos movimentos de Maia denota a força que o presidente da Casa assumiu diante do Executivo. 

 Ao lidar com as regras da quarentena para possíveis[ infectados pelo coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/se-coronavirus-se-espalhar-nao-ha-sistema-de-saude-que-de-conta-diz-medica-em-quarentena.shtml), Maia convenceu o governo a enviar um projeto de lei. 

 O deputado argumentou que seria mais rápido e mais seguro do que uma medida provisória. O pano de fundo da decisão, porém, é que Maia é um notório crítico do uso das MPs, vistas pelos parlamentares como um mecanismo do Planalto para passar por cima do Legislativo.

 O presidente da Câmara também vem distribuindo patadas pela Esplanada nas primeiras semanas do ano. 

 O alvo preferencial é o ministro da Educação, com quem Maia está irritado desde que [Weintraub demitiu](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2019/12/mec-demite-presidente-do-fnde-sem-avisar-titular-do-cargo.shtml), sem qualquer comunicação prévia, o presidente do FNDE (Fundo Nacional de Desenvolvimento da Educação). 

 Rodrigo Sérgio Dias, exonerado em dezembro, era indicado do presidente da Câmara —que, segundo aliados, só foi avisado por meio do Diário Oficial.

 Desde então, Maia já declarou que [Weintraub atrapalha o país](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2020/01/presidente-da-camara-diz-que-ministro-da-educacao-e-um-desastre.shtml), que representa a “bandeira do ódio” e que o fato de ele ser ministro demonstra uma falha de construção.

 ""Nosso país não tem futuro, né? Não tem futuro. Parece um passado ruim, porque conseguiu fazer de um cara desse o ministro da Educação... Que construção que nós tivemos"", afirmou.

 O ministro já teve sua primeira mostra de que ter a força de Maia no Parlamento trabalhando contra si dificulta a vida. 

 Os deputados deixaram caducar a medida provisória que mudava a carteirinha estudantil. 

 O texto perdeu a validade neste domingo (15), sem nem sequer ter sido instalada a comissão especial, primeira fase para a análise de uma MP.

 Na avaliação do Legislativo, o tema poderia ser tratado por um decreto do Executivo, e não haveria a necessidade de uma lei para regulamentar o assunto.

 Na mira do presidente da Câmara também está o recém-enviado projeto que [autoriza mineração](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/bolsonaro-assina-projeto-que-autoriza-garimpo-em-terras-indigenas.shtml) e geração de energia elétrica em terras indígenas. 

 Para a atividade de garimpo, as comunidades indígenas terão poder de veto. Para a exploração energética, como a construção de hidrelétricas ou termoelétricas, elas serão apenas consultadas previamente.

 Maia criou uma comissão especial para analisar o texto, o que permitirá que controle o cronograma de apreciação da matéria. 

 Em novembro, quando Bolsonaro falou que enviaria o projeto, o presidente da Câmara afirmou que arquivaria a proposta e disse que não é porque existe garimpo ilegal que ""a gente vai tratar de legalizar o garimpo"".

 Maia vem se consolidando como um[ primeiro-ministro informal ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/12/fernandez-recebe-maia-e-anuncia-ex-vice-argentino-como-embaixador-no-brasil.shtml)desde 2019, segundo seus pares no Congresso. O deputado foi o principal responsável pela articulação política da [reforma da Previdência](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/previdencia/), a grande vitória da gestão Bolsonaro em seu primeiro ano. 

 ### Maia virou ‘primeiro-ministro’ informal

  * **Bandeira** Presidente da Câmara assumiu protagonismo desde a votação e aprovação da reforma da Previdência, cara à gestão Bolsonaro
 * **Anteparo** Maia criticou integrantes do governo por medidas que considerou antidemocráticas e autoritárias, o que causou desgastes com o presidente
 * **Rusga** Demissão de indicado seu na Educação sem consulta prévia azedou de vez relação com ministro Abraham Weintraub
 * **Base** Deputados têm sinalizado apoio ao líder da Casa, sobretudo quando veem em gestos de Bolsonaro sinais de desprestígio ao meio político e de tentativa de descolamento do Congresso
 * **2020 **Maia deixou clara a intenção de capitanear as discussões sobre as reformas tributária e administrativa, consideradas prioritárias pela equipe econômica"

> Tourism has already been negatively impacted, with concern growing that the deadly outbreak may not be contained in time for the Tokyo Olympic Games in July.


> Analysts had been expecting Japan’s growth to slow thanks to a rise in sales tax, the fallout from a powerful typhoon, and the continuing effects of a trade war between America and China.

> “Consumer spending, which slumped following the tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019, will now struggle to do anything except contract further in the first quarter as the impact of Covid-19 weighs on consumer sentiment, weighing in particular on the consumer services sector,” said Dutch bank ING in a report.

Flu survey is one of the main tools used by PHE to track Flu and flu like illnesses in the UK. Every week they send out an email asking if you have a cold/flu, symptoms have you been vaccinated, and how do you feel out of 100.
Thus is then tallied with other ili reports to give a more true overview of what's going on in the UK.
Why should you sign up? When the coronavirus hits there will be a massive increase in reported ili.with this you can track down to the postcode level if needed  this will help medical teams coordinate a better response. 
You can see if you really should be staying away from people.

I am still figuring this out.  But who stated facts here, other than that folks are speculating?  And there are preprints and reports from now and earlier about this stuff, and I am just reading them and speculating indeed!  I think the main thing I got wrong was the fact that SARS virus is a betacoronavirus like this new one is as well.  Good excuse to correct myself.  

Someone asked me to look at a blog, and I did video about what I read.  I hope you are right.  

Would like this post a whole lot more if you were less angry and more forthcoming. I just want answers, and when folks are telling me I should be more worried about the flu, I get suspicious.  

The preprint by the Greek group makes the argument that recombination is an unlikely explanation, and it got published after bioarchive.  So peer-reviewed, unlike the preprint you've linked to.  I don't know a PhD's worth about viruses, but that paper says what it says.  I can read.  

Your preprint argues against engineered, but not against laboratory origin, nor does it claim to prove anything really.  Most of the details of the virus, including the furin protease cleavage sites and ACE2 receptor affinity are right.  The Greek virologists make the argument that this affinity isn't found in other betacoronavirus strain sequences, or the stepwise mutations weren't there.  That doesn't mean that's correct, but it was peer reviewed.  I guess you read that.  

From your linked paper: 

""It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features.""

Here they are making an argument about whether or not commercially or field-specific betacorqonavirus tool were used...as if there are only these tools available.  This doesn't feel sufficient in the age of CRISPR-Cas9 and other technologies.  

And they use protein modeling to predict optimal sequences; how's that for reliability these days?  I do like the argument that the unexpected optimality of the affinity for the ACE2 being NOT the predicted sequences.  Our computers didn't predict this, so no one would have made it.  

They mention selection/growth and mutation in the lab.  They mention that MERS has had the chance 8 times to mutate in humans after zoonotic jumping but hasn't managed to mutate.

Then they admit it's at least possible and explain how it might be done in a dish:

""In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the observed RBD mutations site during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies with SARS-CoV5 as well as MERS-CoV31. However, the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site or O-linked glycans - if functional - argues against this scenario. New polybasic cleavage sites have only been observed after prolonged passaging of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in cell culture or animals. Furthermore, the generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with a very high genetic similarity. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required an intense program of passage in cell culture or animals with ACE-2 receptor similar to humans (e.g. ferrets).

It is literally physically impossible to somehow FILTER a goddamn virus. Anything that could block a virus would also block literally all air molecules as well, being essentially just a barrier and not a filter. UV light, however, sanitizes by degrading the bonds holding viral DNA together.

The idea that you would even bring in filtration when people are talking about a virus made you look stupid, and the person who replied to you was pointing that out without outright saying it. It also seems like you didnt really understand the main issue about how it spreads either. We DO know how it spreads. That isn't what they were saying at all. We know it's airborne, but the thing is, almost all airborne viruses are only capable of infecting people if they basically go right from one body into another. 

The idea that it could leave an infected person and then somehow travel to the next room, let alone go all through the duct work and into areas of the ship that are far away, is crazy. It isn't physically impossible for that to occur, but humanity has never had to deal with a virus acting that way,and it would be devastating.

Per the CDC ([https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html)) last year, the flu caused the following deaths in just the United States alone:

\-2,450 ""young workers"" (aged 18-49) died

\-266 infant/toddler deaths (0-4)

\-211 deaths among children aged 5-17

\- 65,388 deaths

That is just last year's flu season in the US, alone.

COVID-19 has not (yet) shown statistically significant different ratios in the above groups.

Further, even if we only heard about a fraction of the Flu deaths under age 50 *only in the US*, it would still completely overwhelm the news cycle -- there'd be a new report of a ""young person dying of the flu"" essentially constantly."

By freely opening its borders, South Korea would deal with a large amount of Chinese immigrants.

It's also good to use this situation and your friend's info for a Bigger Picture Analysis. The most important thing is how you can improve your interactions so that you're not an afterthought, or a marginalized member. I think that's worth doing.

So here's where I would start. What I look for in friends (especially at initial stages) are 3 things I call PIE: Positivity, Interest in Others and Enthusiasm. (Not that you can't share negative things with friends, but still the majority of interactions should have a Positive Vibe.) I think of it as ""bringing the fun, and an optimistic outlook."" This starts with a genuine smile (google real smile vs fake if you're not sure), which involves the eyes. Even your tone of voice communicates positivity. Second interest in others means asking good questions, and making appropriate followup questions or comments. Being empathetic toward their situation etc. Remember their details.

The last, Enthusiasm, is the one that is most often missing. It's Positivity Plus. It's bringing a fun happy vibe everywhere you go. It's being excited at their good news. It's having a few ideas on fun things to do. It's telling a little story about yourself about something funny that happened. (I try to look for at least one funny thing per day that happened to me that I can share in a small talk situation. It can related to my goofy dog. Traffic. Anything. How I plan to avoid Coronavirus. Anything.) 

Conversational skills. If you feel you need work on this, then I would literally practice every day in low-stakes situations. People like: grocery cashiers, gym attendants, store clerks, waiters/waitresses, coffee baristas, etc. Practice approaching each interaction by making the person's day brighter. Practice your: smile, greeting, compliments, humor, energy level. See which comments get a better reaction. Learn to banter and have fun with these service people during your brief interaction. If you work at this daily you WILL get better at it. You will gain confidence. You will gain presence. You will be able to translate this new skill to your regular social life. It does take WORK to remember to do this. It's trial and error. But it WILL pay off!

Start with bringing 10 percent more enthusiasm to every encounter. See what happens. Within a matter of a month or two, you'll be ready to make friends everywhere you go. You can use it on the current social circle, or create a whole new one.

Start small, and build on little successes. Enthusiasm and a genuine smile are key. Good luck!"

Yes, China has way more people, but it's also way bigger. Because of this, for certain situations, we use population density rather than population.

I.E. If a country had a population of 5million but in an 200 square mile area, it would have people twice as close together as London. It's this closeness that causes a virus to spread. Loads of people squished in a small area. That's why both the cruse ship and Wuhan had such a problem with coronavirus.

Automation might need a bigger initial investment, but it guarantees that the company controls the means of production and is actually as cheap if not cheaper in the long run. You'd also drop the risk of supply chain disruption so there will be people who will opt for it (and even more as automation becomes cheaper and cheaper to implement), and so even when manufacturing jobs are ""brought back to the country"", chances are that a large part of them will be automated and the company will end up hiring 20-30% of its original workforce due to labour savings from automation.

I understand what you are saying; however, I'm not convinced that we are necessarily doomed by a virus mutation. But the danger is sufficient to take adequate measures. There is no absolute safety in this world, and the more we try to achieve it, the greater the obstacles we are going to face.

Ultimately, it is a political and not a scientific issue. At a time the president of the most powerful country in the world can claim that ""climate change science is a Chinese hoax"", we are in deep trouble. Our political system functions by both sides of the political spectrum presenting reality in a mutually exclusive biased manner. Yet, no matter how many lies a politician may tell, we cannot censor the lies by banning them, we can only try to fight them by presenting a counter argument, which will, in turn, face counter-arguments by the opposing sides, ad infinitum. That's political dialectics. That's how life progresses and maybe that is also how microorganisms progress. 

Regarding the lab-escaped-coronavirus conspiracy, I can't see that it is very virulent. It's obvious that it is pushed by certain anti-PRC lobbies including Falun Gong, Taiwan, etc. I don't believe it'll prevent measures against a potential pandemic, if it is that what you fear. What will prevent adequate measures is people's lethargy or reluctance to contemplate a change of life-style. 

Regarding the political aspect, I think it is totally legitimate to promote a pro-democracy movement by showing the failings of CCP with regards to the virus outbreak. That some people chose conspiracy theories to further this aim is unfortunate but unavoidable since its part of the political game."

Update: Traditional Chinese medicine effective in COVID-19 treatment: official
Source: Xinhua| 2020-02-17 20:36:55|Editor: huaxia

Medical workers check patients' information at Jiangxia temporary hospital in Wuhan, capital city of central China's Hubei Province, Feb. 14, 2020. The hospital is the first temporary hospital that mainly adopt Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) to treat the patients. (Xinhua/Cheng Min)

Traditional Chinese medicines has been used in treating 60,107 confirmed cases in China, or 85.2 percent of the total: official

BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been proven effective in curing patients of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a Chinese health official said Monday.

For example, a TCM decoction named ""Qingfei Paidutang"" has been used in treating 701 confirmed cases in 10 provinces, of which 130 have been cured and discharged, said Li Yu, an official with the National Administration of TCM.

Symptoms have disappeared in 51 cases and improved in 268, with another 212 remaining in stable condition, said Li, adding that the decoction was recommended to medical institutions nationwide on Feb. 6 after data analysis on 214 cases.

Li also shared the analysis and statistics cases with detailed clinical records, as 94.6 percent of the 112 patients restored to normal body temperature, and 80.6 percent of 214 patients stopped coughing after using the decoction for six days.

The data showed the decoction's good clinical effect and treatment prospect on COVID-19, said Li.

The central government's joint prevention and control mechanism on the situation has called for stronger cooperation between TCM and Western medicine in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, requiring local authorities to promote the use of TCM in the whole process of diagnosis and treatment.

As of Monday, more than 3,100 medical personnel from over 630 TCM hospitals across the country have been sent to aid Hubei Province in the fight against the epidemic, said Jiang Jian, another official of the national administration.

TCM has been used in treating 60,107 confirmed cases in China, or 85.2 percent of the total, according to Jiang. ■

""The coronavirus produces mild cold symptoms in about 80% of patients, Dr. Sylvie Briand, head of WHO’s Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness division, told reporters on Monday. **About 15% of the people who contract the virus have ended up with pneumonia, with 3% to 5% of all patients needing intensive care,** she said.""

In the US, a COVID-19 pneumonia would probably equal some level of hospitalization, at least for a few days. So, let's say 15% hospitalization. But, that rate has to be calculated against the **currently symptomatic** patient count. 

I use the 3-5% ICU rate in the same way, choosing an average of 4%. 

Two variables I can't currently confirm are:
* How long are patients symptomatic? Incubation is 2 to 14 days, but how long until the patient is virus free? I estimate two weeks, base on other viruses. 
* How long is the average ICU stay? I estimate one week, but that's just a guess. 

If you have any data on this, please add it [to the comments in my r/Epidemics](https://www.reddit.com/r/epidemic/comments/f41p44/what_percent_of_a_developed_countrys_population/) post! I'd welcome the feedback."

Therefore Coronaviruses along with influenza and measles can be considered as ""airborne"".

If you're going to say that *it's possible* that it was a biological attack then you'd better have good reason for saying so. 

Given that this was posted in a biochemistry subreddit, it's reasonable to expect contributors and commenters to have a basic understanding of science and so it follows that they should have some awareness of how to argue their point. 

A basic tenant of science is that if you're proposing the possibility of an idea against the established consensus or facts (and no, no distinction need be made between believing something and saying it might be possible) then the burder of proof lies with that individual to suggest that even the possibility is worth considering. 

This all started because it was said that one side doesn't have evidence that it was a biological weapon and the other side doesn't have evidence to rule out the possibility of a biological weapon so it was said that we should consider both possibilities - that's not how it works! Suggesting that a novel coronavirus is not surprisingly given the conditions in Wuhan and what we know about viruses agrees with our current understanding of these sorts of events. In fact it's remarkably similar to what we saw with SARS. It follows that it's reasonable to believe this is simply a somewhat random event until evidence to the contrary is presented that we should consider alternative possibilities.


They're not being downvoted because people disagree, they're being downvoted because suggesting that this was a weapon without reason to think so detracts from intelligent discourse, which in fact is the while point of this entire post."

Coronavirus is a true catastrophe to the Chinese province of Hubei. Even some other areas of China have small numbers. There’s a spike in Japan that is a little worrying but relative to the population of japan it’s not exactly common. 

Part 1 will most likely not be delayed. I’m in Tokyo and while some companies have started to allow working from home, I don’t think any company has actually shut down. There’s panic, but it hasn’t slowed down the country. The game appears to be mastered (“gold”), and while hardware is made in China and it did delay a limited edition Nintendo Switch, most discs are not made in China. Generally, discs for Japan are made in Japan, discs for the Americas are made in the USA, and discs for Europe and the rest of the world are made in Austria. 

On Part 2, it’s hard to tell whether any delay will happen since we have absolutely no indication as to when it will come out. Did it come out in 2023 (for example) because of Coronavirus? Or was it an unforeseen major bug that crashed the beta version? Is 2023 actually a year earlier than Square Enix originally scheduled? We wouldn’t know. 

Anyway, as others have said, if it gets in the way of games development it means that we have more serious things to worry about."

I’ve been thinking about it for weeks, and finally said screw it, I’m gonna go because I’ve had my time off approved, and I’ve been wanting to go for a while now. I work in the medical field and I am knowledgeable about infection control, so I was just planning on practicing proper hand hygiene, wearing an N95 mask to be extra safe, refraining from touching my face, etc. Woke up this morning and read the news, saw that the disease is spreading in Japan, got scared, and now having serious second thoughts. Thankfully, I’m still within the 24 hour period of booking the flight, so I’m just waiting for my partner to get home and we’ll decide together if we should just go straight to the Philippines.

It's current run time of deaths has surpassed ebola. 

Because Ebola kills almost everyone it infects and extreme measures had been put into place. To stem the spread. This is what you aren’t understanding. Your looking at the numbers and not accounting for any number of variables.   COVID-19 is being spread in a country that has a very poor medical system, first world countries have been able to halt the spread of infections with basic supportive care and self quarantine.
Deaths outside of China are extreamly low. The death rate for COVID-19 outside of china is 0.7%. 

Canada has 7 confirmed cases currently, all under self quarantine, all being monitored by public health officials. Within a month of the first case in Canada we have yet to see a person to person transmutation within Canada. The US has seen 1 person to person transmission.

2020-02-17,Jordedude1234,FutureWhatIf,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureWhatIf/comments/f5braz/fwi_what_if_china_sent_a_space_station_to_orbit/fhy2s1y/,"They'd definitely add landing a person on Mars to the mission objective quite easily, as having a crew survive with no hope of resupply for months at a time, a lot of developments would have to be made very quickly for this to be done in the next 20 years. With the coronavirus, I don't see it happening that quickly. A timeline in the 2050s or 2060s is far more realistic, though they would still have to make very significant advancements.

I'm talking about stuff like an hydroponics farm on the station with water possibly being supplied from the Martian poles (that would necessitate a mining station on Mars). Significant advances in protection from radiation, especially in space suits. Astronauts suffering from bone decay and other health issues while being in a Zero-G environment.

For the ISS we can just send people home from the station after a year or less, as the health issues develop. For Mars, they would be out there without quick access to Earth resources for at least a year or two, with much of that time spent just getting to the planet, meaning they would need to spend more time there to actually do things on the station.

A few sources to give you an idea of what I am talking about:

>""According to NASA Goddard Space >Flight Center's website, the ideal >lineup for a launch to Mars would get >you to the planet in roughly nine >months.""

https://www.space.com/amp/24701-how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-mars.html

Nine months is an average one-way trip, so a return trip takes that to eighteen months on average (1 and a half years). Then you add time spent on the station or Mars itself. To actually do something there, they would have to be there even longer.

https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/radiation-remains-problem-any-mission-mars-180959092/

As for radiation on a manned Mars mission, ""...engineers still don’t have effective methods to shield astronauts from these dangers, and that adds an extra level of risk...""

He moved out of the car, turned his camera and began interviewing, and he stated that the driver had been tested for the new coronavirus the day before. The driver was asymptomatic and had heard that he would be contacted if the test was positive, but he said he was working because there was no contact.

However, during the interview, the health center contacted the driver's mobile phone and found that the test result was positive. The driver was surprised as he moved away from the director, explaining the situation on the phone, saying, ""I'm working. I'm receiving a TV interview.""

According to a TBS spokeswoman, the male director was an employee of an affiliate of TBS. After the interview, the man contacted the consultation desk and told him that he had contacted the infected person, but he said that he had not been tested because he was ""no symptoms and could not be tested.""
As of February 17, the male director's physical condition has not changed, but the male is said to be waiting at home for the time being.

In the past 12 months, China has had a massive culling of pigs due to swine flu, the coronavirus, probably from bats, and then just a couple of weeks ago, there was a flare up of avian flu found in chickens.  It is becoming relentless in China these days.  Also, an estimated 70% of new viruses come from animals, and by selling exotic game in markets, it is bringing a lot of new viruses into close contact with humans and allowing transmission.

I know no one in China wants to talk about meat consuption, but trying to feed a billion people pork means that there are a ton of pigs in very little space.  And as the global population gets bigger and bigger, I am starting to wonder if we really need to push people to move away from meat just so we don't create a new deadly superbug."

In the meantime, while the party was downplaying the risk and arresting doctors and activists, they gave the go-ahead for a massive potluck in Wuhan where 40,000 families ate from the same table.

First your pivoting away from the conversation. Which was about the blatant racism in Asian communities and countries that largely is ignored on this sub. Secondly I NEVER said Asian business owners don’t work hard. However, Asians are more likely then blacks to receive loans from banks in which they can then proceed to open up business’s in black communities. That in and of itself is fine but the problem stems from the persistent racial profiling that goes on in these businesses which has long been a point of contention between black and Asian communities. Not only that but these businesses will usually not hire blacks as well. Saying they funnel money out of the black communities isn’t a false statement nor generalizing since that money isn’t circulating within the black community. I don’t care if Asians open a business if a predominantly black neighborhood as long as they treat the black folks living there with the same respect they’d treat a white person. 

Also I know Africa’s situation is the result of its corrupt politicians, however your pivoting away from how bigoted mainland Chinese people are and behave on the continent. In this sub I’ve seen people talk about how ALL whites and blacks should be removed from Asian countries due to the actions of a few. If I made that same argument you would be calling me a bigot. If you see the comments regarding that video in the Chinese websites it’s circulating you’d know that this sentimentality is common place. You’ll defend the Chinese comparing blacks to animals but in the same breath screech about the bigotry their facing due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Lastly, yes other groups did contribute to the civil rights movement. However blacks still did the overwhelming majority of the work and are treated worse then any other group in this country. Especially by other minorities. We’re made into scapegoats anytime things go to shit in this country yet Asians atleast are accepted as being “honorary whites”. 

Before you say I hate Asians or anything, I find your cultures to be fascinating. I think it’s idiotic why so many of you want to be accepted as white when your already nearly their equal economically, militarily, and culturally. Unlike you blacks have a century or two before we get close to that point."

2020-02-17,teedeepee,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4sxfl/cv_is_no_joke/fhwnmr0/,"Then, no offense, but you failed pretty spectacularly to convey your message, since your original post does not even address the question of ethnicity. You could have made a simple post saying “*nCoV-2019 does not only affect patients of Asian ethnicity, and this article about a couple Caucasians being affected is evidence of that*”. Instead, you made it an unverifiable IRL story that derailed the thread, made it about the patient’s health and age, and you gave it a headline of “CoV is no joke” (gee, really?).

Also, I’ve been subbed to /r/coronavirus, /r/China_Flu, and /r/COVID19 for a while and haven’t  seen claims that the virus only affects people of Asian ethnicity. Which is not surprising, given that non-Asians have been infected as well, as widely reported in the news.

Perhaps you got confused with research pointing to the ACE2 enzyme, which is a binding receptor for several coronaviruses including the ones causing SARS and, seemingly, COVID. It just so happens that that people of Asian descent seem to express this enzyme in greater proportions ([example](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/26/2020.01.26.919985.full.pdf)).

It would certainly be beneficial to discuss this research and understand its implications to the virus spread, severity, and possible treatments. If you’re keen to explore the ethnicity angle before you can dispel it conclusively, perhaps that’s where you could direct your interest. There are plenty of scientific papers from the SARS days and being pre-printed as we speak on this very topic. The one I linked to was literally my first hit on Google Scholar after typing “ACE2 Asian”. Cheers!"

You will no doubt be surprised and disappointed to note that it does not, in fact, suggest self-quarantine.  Only that you try and avoid busier places.

2020-02-17,ipharm,worldnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/f4qxo0/xi_had_early_knowledge_of_coronavirus_severity/fhwlrtv/,"A lot of people don't see the big big picture. The modern CCP is dragging the whole world down a very dark road.


After years of multi-laterism, with Western powers building institutions and organisations like the UN, the World Health Organisation and pushing for democracy  / global standards on human rights, China is now trying to unpick it all for their own advantage.


China is actively subverting democracies around the world - especially Taiwan and Hong Kong, which are most likely preludes to how it will treat other countries in the future. The CCP are expansionist; they are trying to steal territory left right and centre (from 'disputed' regions with its neighbours, to the South China Sea, Tibet, Taiwan, the Arctic and even space). They are trying to expand their sphere of power and influence outwards, appeasing them by giving them Taiwan or the South China Sea will most likely have no better results than it did with a certain German leader.


For anyone who would say that comparing the CCP to the Nazis is crude and contrived, you need only look to the facts. The CCP achieved power through civil war, they refuse their own people political alternatives or decision-making power, they are expansionist and they are actively attacking freedom of information / human rights around the world, they are oppressing their own people (stifling religious, political and even intellectual freedom / expression), and they are trying to export their lowest common denominator, free for all policy abroad by flirting with every dictatorship they can, who they have no moral qualms about endorsing or empowering.


That is the true face of the CCP, they are undermining efforts to hold any country anywhere to any standard, because they would rather pump money into unaccountable dictatorships, regardless of what wrongs or atrocities they might be committing, than lose face and embrace democracy. The CCP believe in unaccountable, top down power, as long as they can be at the head of the table they don't care if we all one day live in a world populated by cruel and arbitrary authoritarian regimes that operate as open-air prisons. They would prefer it if each of those regimes imported Chinese surveillance technology and acted as information silos, with limited access to outside information (that might hold the regimes to account) and no rights to criticise the government or explore political alternatives.


The Chinese government is actively subverting the UN charter of human rights by trying to create its own version, arguing that social stability (as defined and dictated by the government) is the most fundamental human right. In other words, as long as the government is, very broadly speaking, providing some form of stability, any other human right is secondary, and can be violated in pursuit of 'stability'. China is now trying to sell this version of human rights around the world to justify the kinds of practices you see at home, in Hong Kong etc. etc.


I hope the experience of the coronavirus is a wake up call for the Chinese people, because the good people of Wuhan have been Xinjianged - they have been put on lock down, dragged out of their homes and forced into shoddy temporary quarantine sites that don't have sufficient medical resources, and when they have tried to speak up they have been drowned out by the states propoganda and censorship. The government has actively killed as many people as it has saved due to its heavy-handed miscalculations and its inability to show efficacy without resorting to unnecessary force.


Again, please don't buy products from China where it can be avoided, the country has been enriched by positive foreign business relations and engagement in recent decades, and instead of responding in kind (opening up, becoming more democratic) the CCP have been betraying and trying to manipulate the rest of the world ever since. They have tried to punch a whole in the world economy by systematically stealing foreign technology, subsidising their own companies in a way that does not respect WTO rules and denying foreign companies fair access to their own markets. Economically empowering modern China is empowering the CCP, and they have shown themselves to be bad actors in almost every conceivable way. We should not be buying the future the CCP want to foist on us, we shouldn't be rewarding them economically (and politically) while they are actively subverting all democracy, human rights, trust in politics and freedom around the world. We should not be paying them or letting them off the hook for making our world a worse place for us and future generations just because their products are relatively cheap (they are cheap because they lie, cheat and steal, and will continue to do so).


The intellectual in this article is waiting for his fellow Chinese to wake up, but we all need to wake up because this rabbit hole goes very deep."

2020-02-17,somebodyelse22,AgeGap,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeGap/comments/f4ygdk/any_age_gaps_with_partners_over_70/fhwsaqv/,"Ah, I can help here, because my AGR straddles the time from middle age to old age.

  Quick history for you – I am 68 and my wife is 42, thus 26 years gap, and we’ve been married for approaching 20 years.

  When we first married, it was just the same as any relationship that I’d had in my teenage and upward years.  We did silly things, said silly things, and went to events and places spontaneously, grabbing experiences at the drop of a hat. Falling deeply in love with each other was a wonderful gift, as it would be at any age.

  I was divorced with grown up kids and I felt awkward as my wife was approaching their ages. I wrote to them, trying to explain that this wasn’t the desperate fling of an elderly playboy who wouldn’t accept reality, however inconvenient or unconventional it may seem, I wasn’t attempting to cling to youth by having a ‘pretty thing’ on my arm. 

  Turns out, I was the only one that had thought of this, my kids only had to adjust, like in many second marriages, to the new facts that a second wife had arrived, and fit that into family arrangements and situations that included my first wife.
It would seem I got too defensive: one daughter objected, but I think more out of loyalty to my first wife than a real sense of shock, that my wife was much younger than me.

  At this time, I was in my late forties, wife was 23, and our days together were happy. Being older meant that I was more financially stable, so although life isn’t a rich one, it’s better than if we’d both been teenagers or whatever. After years in the same industry, my career was stable and financially rewarding, which hadn’t been the case when I was younger and climbing the ladder.

  I was lucky, my mother-in-law is a year younger than me, but she has never questioned her daughter’s choice of a husband. She initially told her that when she saw how happy we were together, that was all that mattered to her. Frankly, the only time anyone has ever been interested in my AGR, was my boss at work. He used to marvel at me, and think I was something special having a much younger wife, while for me it was just a fact, same as I have blue eyes. It’s just the way it is!

As they say offhandedly in novellas, “time passed” and as the years flew by, things changed a bit.

  My health started to show signs of problems appearing, I guess the same as happens to people as they age. I started to slow down a bit. I rationalised that it was evidence of the wisdom of years and I adapted to a slower pace of things. 
(What is the wisdom of years? A young bull and an old bull are at the top of a hill, and see many cows grazing below. The young bull says excitedly, “Lets run down there and hump a cow each, and the old bull says instead, “No, lets walk down and hump them all.” That’s the wisdom of years…)

  As time has gone by, I retired from work and draw cash monthly from pensions. This gives us a liveable income, and means that I can enjoy my days without stressing about cash. My wife works, and her attitude is that I worked for 40 years before I could enjoy the lazy rewards, and she is proud to do her part.

  Now that I have retired, I spend most days at home, and it’s my wife who recounts tale of her daily doings, that we discuss and enjoy the anecdotes. Despite being at home, I no longer have the impetus to do DIY, so little household chores go unresolved, and I feel that I will pay tradesmen to do jobs that in previous years, I would have done myself.

  My brain is still sharp, I enjoy books and intellectually stimulating things, but after 20 years together, I am sad that she has heard most of my life anecdotes. My wife is great for smiling as if it’s the first time she’s heard a particular story, and she says that she enjoys being reminded of some of my tales.

  I am annoyed by the way my body is getting older and tiring. I don’t like having to accept that my wife carries the shopping bags up the stairs, I don’t like needing a nap to recharge after some physical exercise, and above all else, I don’t want to likely be the first to die. 

  I don’t want my wife left on her own, heading into her old age with memories of me and by having hitched her life to that of myself, an older man, probably condemning herself to a lonely single life when she’s old and needs support. Had she chosen someone closer to her own age, she would have likely had the companionship and support in her older years,that I will not be able to provide her. It grieves me that she will have to handle doctors and hospital visits on her own, and that she won’t have the closeness that I have been so lucky to experience.

  We were discussing the outbreak of coronavirus the other day, and I said jokingly, that in a year or so it would probably kill the pair of us. Her reaction was that it would be a blessing: she wants both of us to die together, in the same way as we’ve lived and loved together for so long. And do you know what? I know what she means, and why."

More than half of mainland provinces expect slower expansion of revenue in 2020 than last year’s average local income growth, according to their budgets published before the disease outbreak became widespread in January. Hubei, the epicenter, was already expecting income to fall.

That stretches the government’s efforts to make fiscal policy more supportive of the economy in the aftermath of the outbreak, and means more bond sales and borrowing are likely. Government at all levels is re-thinking plans for this year as factories and businesses across the country remain shut, spelling immediate trouble for tax receipts.

“Given the current downward pressures on economic growth, it would be really hard, and unreasonable, to try to meet fiscal targets set before the crisis broke out,” said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.

[Read More: What to Watch for in China Stimulus as Virus Impact Hits Economy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-11/what-to-watch-for-in-china-stimulus-as-virus-impact-hits-economy)

China hasn’t exceeded a national deficit ratio of 3% of gross domestic product since at least 2009. The official target would normally be announced after the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature, in March. On Sunday the government pledged to roll out more effective stimulus, with Finance Minister Liu Kun [writing](http://www.mof.gov.cn/zhengwuxinxi/caizhengxinwen/202002/t20200216_3470184.htm) in a Communist Party journal that it will work to reduce corporate taxes and cut unnecessary government expenses.

### Broad Weakness

Among the 28 provinces that have published their 2020 budgets, worsening balances are evident across the board. Mega-cities like Beijing and Shanghai expect their revenue to be “roughly the same” as in 2019, and regional economic powerhouses such as Shandong and Chongqing expect growth of about 1%. Anhui, in central China, forecasts a slump of 17.5% while Hubei originally thought its income would drop by about 13%.

### What Bloomberg’s Economists Say..

“The cost of dealing with the coronavirus and hit to tax revenue as China’s economy slumps are likely to strain some provinces more than others. Most at risk to added fiscal pressure -- the western provinces, where defaults by local government financing vehicles and state-backed firms in 2019 underlined stress even before the virus outbreak.”

Qian Wan, Bloomberg Economics

The national budget for this year hasn’t been announced yet, but [revenue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/Q5GWA0DWRGG3) last year was lower than initially forecast.

To what extent tax income will slow on the damage from the virus is difficult to tell. Although the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 had much smaller economic impact than this one, government revenue took an immediate hit in the first quarter of 2003 as the virus raged, and kept falling in the rest of the year.

### Effect of SARS

Government revenue growth fell on SARS impact in 2003

Source: Ministry of Finance; Blomberg

Analysts are divided about how the shortfalls will be addressed. While economists from Citigroup Inc. to China’s largest brokerage house Citic Securities Co. said officials have to accept a deficit bigger than 3% of China’s gross domestic product, others from Standard Chartered and Goldman Sachs believe that remains politically unpalatable.

“People used to see the 3% deficit ratio as a red line that can’t be breached, but it may not be that important now,” said Liu Peiqian, China economist at Natwest Markets Plc in Singapore. “Similar to the yuan weakening beyond 7 per dollar, breaking red lines could influence the market in the short term, but investors will soon realize it’s actually nothing.”

### Red Line

China’s top leaders have kept their official deficit target below 3%, partly through belt-tightening, as a gesture to deter excessive borrowing as the nation fights debt on multiple fronts. Yet it has also given way to all types of off-balance sheet borrowing, a problem S&P Global Ratings said may re-emerge this year.

Signs of more proactive fiscal policy have already appeared. The Ministry of Finance allowed local governments to sell more than 1.8 trillion yuan ($258 billion) of debt before the annual budget has been approved. The ministry has also announced targeted tax cuts to help companies and households hit by the virus, partially waived social security premiums or delayed taxes.

“Fiscal policy ought to be counter-cyclical, and the tension between revenue and expenditure shouldn’t be a reason to constrain it,” said Xu Gao, chief economist at BOCI Securities Ltd. in Beijing. “The government should increase the fiscal deficit to cope with the virus, and ease spending pressure by selling more debt.”"

Let's compare, for example Coronavirus and Ebola.

**Ebola** is one fucker of a disease. It's deadly and it's awful. Average mortality is around 50%. It's basic reproduction number (R0), though, is rather low (\~1.8) This depends on the country you're looking at, general hygiene, political stability, population centers, general beliefs in the populace regarding diseases... everything influences R0 and mortality.In general, once you came into contact with Ebola, it's pretty infectious, BUT you can only transmit it via body fluids.  So quarantining people is very successful.

Ebola also has the nice little caveat of causing total panic in the populace, because it's so obvious and awful to have.  (important when it comes to the clerics, see later with Coronavirus)

&#x200B;

**Coronavirus** is mostly harmless. It causes the common cold. Sometimes it mutates and turns into a new version like SARS or COVID-19.

It's decently infectious. Since this is an ongoing situation, there are no set numbers, but R0 is said to be around 2.5. There already are voices that claim R0 is way higher and the mortality is lower. Totally possible. But it's in line with the common flu, with the general problem of a nasty little side effect of viral pneumonia. But overall, it has a pretty low mortality.

Coronavirus is spread via respiratory droplets. You cough and you sneeze it out, like the flu. (also, like the pneumonic plague) When you sneeze, you spread these droplets all around you, on people, on surfaces. Even when you cover your sneeze with your hand, you have it on your hand. And then you spread it onto the next doorknob, tabletop, cup, onto the next hand you shake... and someone opens that door, eats off that table, hugs a friend, touches someone's hand to get their attention. Then they rub their eyes, their chin, push back their hair, eat or simply run their hand down their faces.

(PSA: DON'T DO THAT! Sneeze into your elbow and wash your fucking hands. Also, stop touching your faces \^\^)

Now, since you want an epidemic, let's look at China. At some point, someone got a mutated coronavirus from contact with an animal, likely a bat. This person, likely, carried the virus into a crowded place, like a market. They spread it to maybe one other person. That person has regular, unprotected contact with their stall neighbors, their customers, they handle food, they handle goods, they have family.

You only need one superspreader and you have a cluster. (A super spreader does not mean that a person is super infectious, just that they have contact with a lot of people that they can infect. If they have mild symptoms, they won't quarantine themselves. This is the kind of people that goes into work with a cold because ""they don't have a fever"")

You now have a local cluster. And then you might want a reason for a lot of people to come together in an area. A religious festival for example. (In Wuhan it was an annual gathering like a potluck of 40,000 families. And they all ate together)

You can make it innocent: People just didn't know. Or you can make it sinister: Some person is power tried to cover it up to not disturb their day of glory.

But at this point, it's practically impossible to stop.

People who get ill go see doctors, there, they spread the disease. They go to hospitals (the temple) because there are no general practitioners and spread the disease. Because there are so many people, the hospitals are overwhelmed and the severely affected patients start to die because there is not enough care anymore to go around for everybody.

This causes panic, which causes people to mingle, maybe they protest, which causes more people to get infected, which (by simple statistics) causes more severe cases, which causes more deaths.

You don't need to solve the problem of the priests. Once you have enough infected, they simply can't keep up anymore. This is what has happened in Hubei province in China and that's why they have so many deaths. In countries with low infection rates, people still get proper care and very few die.

&#x200B;

So, if I were your druid, I'd release his gift of nature at a major event. Coronation, market festival, religious festival even.

Another thing: You either make this disease have a slow progression (AIDS) or you make it less deadly. (Corona)

Fast, deadly viruses burn themselves out faster because their victims don't have enough time to infect other people. It's also a common saying that viruses mutate to be less deadly over time, because it prolongs their spread. If you have a fast-acting, deadly disease, just nail doors and windows shut, then burn the city down to contain it. Just make sure nobody gets out.

Eventually, though, every disease will burn itself out. What normally happens is that people who had it become immune and the virus doesn't have enough people to infect it anymore. It works like its own vaccine, giving people her immunity from itself.

The reason why that doesn't work with the flu, btw. is the fact that this little fucker keeps mutating all the time. Just little shifts in the puzzle pieces of its surface vectors et voila, in a year or two, you basically have a new virus. That's why flu vaccines have such short life spans and don't always fully work. But, even having a similar blueprint already helps the body fight it off. So there's that.

Hi, btw. if you're still reading \^\^

I like you're idea of the plague. The mean thing with the plague is that is has several ways of spreading: via animals and via humans.

Flees bite humans, cause bubonic plague or septicemic plague. Infection spreads to the lungs, turns into pneumonic plague.

Pneumonic plague spreads from person to person via droplet infection. Flees bite people, take up the virus, bite the next person. And so on.

To get it under control, your heroes would have to do two things: Isolation and hygiene.

Get infected people off the streets and clean up whatever your druid uses to spread the disease (flees? butterflies? tribbles?)

And get people to wash. their. hands!

Or, they could just close the gates and try to find a cure, in the hopes that nobody escapes in the meantime.

P.S.: If Corona becomes a global pandemic, the best thing you can do, if you're not in the high-risk group of older and immune-compromised people, is to stay at home, stay in bed, practice good hygiene and not infect anyone.

&#x200B;

My very best wishes to my assigned BfV agent. No, I haven't yet given up my love for viruses. Sorry. But I promise I 'll go back to nuclear safety and dirty bombs soon. Have a great day mate, greetings to the wife."

It could be the fact that because sex had never occurred between these two people before, that a disease would manifested equally from both parties involved.

Stop embarrassing yourself, you're literally making the pseodo-science of anti-vaxxers seem rational.

Syphilis is caused by the bacterium treponema pallidum. There's no ""it manifested equally from the two parties"". Literally not how any of this works. 

>  but, Hippocrates had described the same symptoms before any such contact.

You know similar symptoms can be found in multiple diseases, right? There's symptoms of cancer that manifest with conditions that aren't cancer, right? 

> To say its origin was of the native people and of the native people only, seems a little disproportionate, and not a cause of the equally industrious europeans and the susceptible natives.

Listen to the nonsense you're spouting. Native Americans knew of syphilis, and it existed in their populations. It did not exist in European populations until European travelers brought it back with the from the Americas. There's nothing proportionate or disproportionate about it - it's fact. Just like we can trace Ebola to Africa, and the coronavirus currently in the headlines to China. 

But if you don't like syphilis again, there's plenty of other illness present in native populations pre-European contact.

> Either way the disease was not an occurrence until contact. Its prominence not being serious until then.

You have no clue what you're talking about.

> The natives did have diseases, your right, ranging from the minor skin blotches, to the crooked mouth. None was deadly or life altering.

Again, you have no idea what you're talking about, and completely inaccurate. Native Americans died from syphilis.

> Infection vs infectious:...

It wasn't a vs situation, not sure why you're throwing that in. And apparently not, since you think ""infectious elements"" could include trash, while you seem to doubt the existence of viruses and bacterium as they actually exist.

And can I say the paragraphs that follow this is garbled mess where it sounds like you've half listened to some actual science, and then mixed it up with some new age nonsense.

Add in - it's also subjects that have nothing to do with vaccines. Again, have the healthiest diet you like but viruses have evolved to infect the healthy and the ill.

> Restricting ones self to a single environment or food sources is the same as restricting ones mind to only one course of sciences. 

No, there is only one ""course of sciences"". There can be a competing hypotheses, ideas that aren't proven, debates over results etc but there isn't some alternative version of biology where Native Americans and Europeans slept together and their respective bacterium did a fusion dance to form syphilis.

We know the cause of small pox, of polio, of measles etc. We know how to treat it, we understand how vaccines work and how they help prevent those illnesses. That is fact. Being in tune with nature does no protect you against a virus like a vaccine does, again as history shows when tribal societies were exposed to smallpox.

> Just take a look at our society now, the number one cause if death is heart disease, its not because of some virus..

Utterly irrelevant to a discussion on the importance of vaccines, because vaccines are for viral and bacterial infections, not heart disease because you've spent a lifetime eating poorly and never exercising (though, noteworthy, even people who have sometimes develop heart disease).

Poor health can lead to illness, no one is denying that. The illnesses it contributes to though are not the same diseases that vaccines help protect against. If you're living an unhealthy lifestyle you could be damaging your organs which could result in cancer or heart disease, but it's not going to result in the spontaneous manifestation of smallpox, because smallpox is a viral infection.

> So if we can agree to disagree so be it, but I am happy to have shared what I believe to be true and will share my sources with you

I'm quite happy to agree you're wrong about most of what you've said, and your ""beliefs"" have mostly no evidence to support them, from vaccines being unnecessary if you're in touch with nature, to Native Americans being disease free before Europeans.

> Ps. In know the importance and necessity of vaccinations in an industrial society, I am a huge fan of Pasteurs works. 

You've got a funny way of showing it."

I told him I knew ,and agreed , that the chances were insanely slim of us catching something from him (considering his flight was from one end of north america to the other ,and nowhere near the hotzones) But I still didn’t feel like it was necessary to risk it, however slim. But he really wanted to hangout and tell us stories of his trip, and took it really personally at the time.

I read that most flu viruses can live on surfaces for 2-24hrs, so I told him just come hang out the next day. 

He kinda wigged out a bit and I was surprised how poorly he took it.. but then he pretty quickly apologized for taking it personally and admitted he reacted poorly, but till now (1.5 weeks later) he still strongly disagrees with the decision and says I was giving in to all the fear mongering and hype (which I again agreed with he was probably right , but said again that I still would rather not chance it)

Oh and literally 1 month before this He and my other friend GAVE ME the worst Flu ive ever had since Pneumonia as a kid, I was completely out for 2.5 weeks and almost/should’ve been hospitalized but toughed it out, but actually felt for about 3 days like ‘oh ok, i can see how healthy people die from this, this is really bad’
And then yeah, only a few weeks after that, this all happened.

We even have a friend who’s a nurse and when we asked her together on the phone, she immediately said ‘oh yeah, not just for the coronavirus but bc of many viruses and bacteria, its pretty reasonable to’ 
But he’s still insisting I was acting ridiculous. 

So AITA?

Second, given that the working age population decreases by close to half a million people per year, it would be pretty unrealistic to expect robust GDP growth. (I personally believe that the biggest flaw of Abenomics is the reluctance to accept this.) 

However, If you look at the data on a per capita and especially per worker basis, it looks a lot less tragic, and is for instance better than in France or Canada.

And then there's another effect with media: it covers topics people want to hear about, not what's actually important. There were lots of memes some time ago about the media not covering the Amazon forest being on fire. This also means that topics that go on for a long time with no local importance (unlike the Trump impeachment) and no major changes over time tend to get dropped. And when there's a new threat in the world, like the Coronavirus, the media tends to go towards that and leave other topics behind.

Even media is a business, as a European I had to learn that the hard way with Article 13, when most media disagreed with technology experts and the majority of young people due to them profiting from the new regulation."

 O Ibovespa —que se valorizou em 32% em 2019 e ganhou outros 2,53% já no primeiro dia de pregão deste ano— chega ao meio de fevereiro com queda de 1% no ano. Já o [dólar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/dolar-sobe-e-bate-r-431-pela-primeira-vez.shtml), que subiu 4% em 2019, acumula quase o dobro de avanço em pouco mais de 40 dias.

 O ano que era tido para as corretoras como de otimismo e de [recuperação dos principais indicadores econômicos do país](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/no-1o-ano-de-bolsonaro-educacao-saude-e-social-pioram-criminalidade-recua-e-economia-ve-equilibrio.shtml), com inflação controlada e [juros em mínimas históricas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/copom-reduz-taxa-basica-de-juros-para-425-ao-ano.shtml), passou a ser descrito com afirmações menos calorosas e mais cautelosas.

 Um dos motivos são os [dados econômicos do IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/setor-de-servicos-cai-04-em-dezembro-diz-ibge.shtml)para dezembro, que vieram piores do que o esperado pelo mercado.

 Enquanto o varejo interrompeu sete meses de alta e caiu 0,1% em dezembro ante novembro, o setor de serviços encolheu 0,4%.

  O IBC-Br (Índice de Atividade Econômica do Banco Central) caiu 0,27% em dezembro. No ano, avançou 0,89%, após expansão de 1,34% em 2018. O boletim Focus esperava alta de 1,12%.

 De acordo com a Modalmais, os dados deram fim ao momento positivo que se construía até outubro. 

 “Os fundamentos continuam favoráveis à continuidade da recuperação da atividade econômica, mas esses dados mais recentes colocam dúvida quanto ao ritmo dessa recuperação a curto e médio prazo”, afirma relatório da corretora.

 Além dos números fracos, analistas levam em conta nos cenários possíveis impactos de [declarações polêmicas do ministro da Economia, Paulo Guedes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/02/domestica-ia-para-disney-com-dolar-barato-diz-guedes-uma-festa-danada.shtml), e[ do presidente Jair ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/bolsonaro-dribla-conviccoes-e-usa-tom-eleitoral-para-afastar-pressao-apos-morte-de-miliciano.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/02/bolsonaro-dribla-conviccoes-e-usa-tom-eleitoral-para-afastar-pressao-apos-morte-de-miliciano.shtml) na aprovação de reformas, como a administrativa e a tributária.

 Somam-se às preocupações internas dúvidas sobre a economia global: os impactos do novo coronavírus e as incertezas com os Estados Unidos em ano de eleição presidencial.

 Segundo o diretor de renda fixa e multimercados da BNP Paribas Asset Management, Gilberto Kfouri, o principal cenário brasileiro conta com uma redução nas expectativas de crescimento da atividade econômica e da inflação e um aumento da incerteza.

 “De um lado, há um efeito de política monetária que demora para acontecer. De outro, os dados [econômicos] que saíram no início do ano foram abaixo da expectativa, e ainda há outras questões internacionais, como o [coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/veja-o-que-se-sabe-ate-agora-sobre-o-coronavirus-chines.shtml), que não deixam o investidor saber o que pode acontecer.”

 O risco mundial também influencia a saída de estrangeiros —maior fatia dos investidores na Bolsa. No ano, há um déficit de R$ 25,3 bilhões de investimento estrangeiro em ações brasileiras.

 “Essa incerteza internacional já traz indicadores negativos para o mundo. Para o Brasil, ainda somam-se as falas desgovernadas de Guedes, que atrapalham ainda mais as reformas, que já estão mais lentas do que o esperado. Até os fundos imobiliários, que eram o charme do ano passado, se desvalorizaram. A vida do investidor está mais complexa”, diz William Eid, coordenador do centro de estudos de finanças da FGV (Fundação Getulio Vargas).

 O Ifix (índice de fundos imobiliários) da B3 desvalorizou 4,6% em 2020. Em 2019, subiu 36%. Já o índice de renda fixa S&P/B3 Inflação —que subiu 11,45% em 2019— acumula ganho de 1,25% neste ano.

 Para Rodrigo Assumpção, planejador financeiro da Planejar, este ano deve ser mais difícil para os investimentos no geral, principalmente porque grande parte do otimismo de 2019 veio pelas medidas de controle da dívida pública e pela aprovação da reforma da Previdência.

 “O investimento na Bolsa neste ano vai ter que ser mais selecionado. Agora, precisamos ver a economia crescer de fato e investir em empresas mais bem preparadas.”

 Ele afirma, também, que o ambiente de juros impulsiona o investidor de perfil mais conservador para a renda variável como forma de abranger mais risco a fim de ter maior rentabilidade.

 “O perfil de risco [do investidor] não deve mudar conforme o cenário [econômico], mas tendemos a seguir muito o mercado e acaba que, quando o mercado sobe, o investidor vira agressivo, e, quando cai, vira conservador”, afirma.

 Já segundo o diretor-geral da Fator Administração de Recursos, Paulo Gala, há o risco de a Selic, hoje na mínima histórica de 4,25% ao ano, cair mais, mas são baixas as chances de a Bolsa subir em 2020 com a mesma intensidade do ano anterior.

 “Agora, é preciso escolher as ações certas”, diz o diretor, sugerindo os fundos de ações “stock picking” [papéis selecionados] para os investidores que aceitam mais risco. Esses fundos são geralmente mais caros —entre 1,5% e 2% de taxa de administração ao ano—, pois o gestor é mais criterioso na escolha dos papéis.

 Para a renda fixa, Gala recomenda [títulos do Tesouro Direto ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/12/expectativa-de-que-juros-vao-parar-de-cair-leva-a-perdas-em-titulos-do-tesouro.shtml)indexados à inflação. “Escolher o [papel com vencimento em] 2045 ou 2055 e deixar por cerca de 20 anos. Caso o dólar vá a R$ 6 e a inflação volte a 6% ao ano, esse investimento protege o capital.”

 Segundo o economista Alan Ghani, não basta ter o conhecimento sobre o que está acontecendo no mercado e no ambiente econômico brasileiro e mundial. Outros fatores como entender o objetivo do investimento, os prazos, o perfil de risco e as taxas também são importantes.

 “O investidor que entra agora na Bolsa sem ter o conhecimento certificado não pode buscar o “day trading” [operações arrojadas na Bolsa, que buscam rendimentos com a compra e a venda de ativos no mesmo dia ou de um dia para o outro]. É importante ter em mente que, quanto maior for o horizonte de tempo, maior poderá ser o ganho”, afirma.

 De acordo com Ghani, um prazo razoável para deixar o dinheiro investido vai de cinco a dez anos. 

 Para se proteger dos riscos, especialistas recomendam diversificar todos os tipos de investimento, tanto renda fixa quanto variável.

 Dentre as opções com menos risco e ganho real (acima da inflação) estão títulos de dívidas privadas (debêntures), CRIs (certificado de recebíveis imobiliários) e CRAs (certificado de recebíveis do agronegócio). Já os ETFs (fundos baseados em determinados índices de ações, com cotas negociadas em Bolsa) e os fundos multimercado e de ações oferecem mais retorno, porém são mais arriscados. 

 Para especialistas, contudo, eles são preferíveis ao investimento direto em ações, pois são geridos por profissionais."

1b) All of these cases were in Australia for quite some time before any of the control measures you mention. That's the whole reason it's implausible they infected nobody. The Queensland cases had spent DAYS touring Melbourne and taking flights before they were caught. So R0 is very applicable to them. You actually would NOT expect anyone outside their travel group to be picked up, as the nature of tourism is that all the people they came into contact with in crowded places weren't people known to them, and anyone infected would actually not have any knowledge of coming into contact with someone from Hubei (and therefore aren't even eligible for testing). What we DO know is they transmitted to each other, so its very likely that they DID transmit to others, just that contact tracing is very difficult for foreign tourists how were moving around crowded areas of unknown people.
1c)What you personally prefer is not what the science, and the actual events in other countries, is increasingly showing. This isn't a matter of personal opinion. You can't just ignore the facts, because you 'prefer' a different version of reality. Further, the most recent, higher R0 estimates, aren't based on Wuhan alone. It's based on international cases that are less reliant about uncertainties like hypothesized date of ""first infection"". Hence why these most recent studies are more reliable than the older, lower ones.

2) The federal guidelines must have been updated this afternoon. Here is the complaints from GP's, today, that they were in conflict with the guidelines of some states https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/coronavirus-criteria-expand-again

Victoria doesn't publish there stats whatsoever. And given the fact that we had 4 confirmed cases, and 5 who spent days in our city prior to being caught in a different state, effectively that's 9 opportunities for transmission. More than double that of NSW. I don't think NSW example is indicative of what's happening around the country.

You've done an absolute about-face. You first claimed ""nobody is complaining about not getting tested"". And now you've reverted that anyone who complains about not being tested is 'a hypochondriac"". Like I said, there are several complaints from Australian's on this sub alone. Look. Further, one of the GP's who diagnosed one of our first Australian cases, today said that he fears the number of cases is ""much much higher"" than we are reporting, specifically because there have been ""artificial limits"" placed on the number of cases that can be confirmed, due to the way testing is being carried out and who the GP's are being told they should be considering as a suspected case. 
 https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/coronavirus-criteria-expand-again. 

What you are saying about separation of states vs a central governing body, makes little sense. Having the states manage it individually only is beneficial if they all do as a good a job as one central body would. Your whole argument rests on the premise that this is the case, when by no means is that true. Further, there is no accountability, and health professionals themselves are complaining that it's not working (see the racgp complaint above). So I would tend no to agree with your claim. At any rate, what you are arguing is nothing but a matter of subjective personal opinion."

> By Nicholas Yong and Dhany Osman

> SINGAPORE — From Tuesday night (18 February), all travellers returning from mainland China outside of Hubei province within the last two weeks will not be allowed to leave their house during a 14-day period as part of measures to curb the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.

> The new arrangement, announced by the multi-ministry taskforce on the coronavirus on Monday, will mean that returnees will not be allowed to leave their homes briefly to buy meals or household supplies during the period.

> The 14-day Stay-Home Notice will be stricter than the existing leave of absence (LOA), made mandatory for all returnees, Singapore residents and long-term pass holders, from mainland China outside of Hubei province.

> The notice will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. 

> “At the same time, there are substantial number of Singaporeans, citizens, permanent residents, and long term pass holders still in China. I think at some point in time, they will want to come back to Singapore, especially after the Chinese New Year holidays. And there is a higher chance now that some of them will be infected with the virus,” said Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the taskforce.

> Those who flout the notice may face penalties and can be prosecuted under Section 21A of the Infectious Disease Act. Foreign workers may have their work passes revoked and be repatriated, while employers may have their work pass privileges withdrawn.

> Students may face disciplinary actions from their schools or institutions, while long-term visa pass or dependant's pass holders may have their re-entry permit, or relevant passes revoked or validity shortened.

> Wong reinforced that the authorities will be enforcing the requirements ""strictly"" with a whole range of methods, including technology such as video calls and identifying where their locations are to implement spot checks.

> With the introduction of the Stay-Home Notice, the government will no longer be issuing any more new LOAs to returnees with recent travel history to mainland China outside of Hubei, the authorities added.

On the 7th of Feb we only had one lab which was able to analyse COVID19 samples. This was in London and could only process approx 100 samples a day.

The labs are in the following locations:

* Scotland (2 laboratories)
* Northern Ireland
* Wales
* London
* Cambridge
* Birmingham
* Bristol

* Newcastle

Why would the UK equip 12 labs with equipment and expertise all over the UK when they will stop testing once the confirmed number reaches 100?

That being said, the best thing you can do to have a healthy immune system is to be healthy in general. Light exercise (especially including weights) and eating nutritionally balanced meals will go a long way. 

Additionally, if one of your main goals is to lose weight, calories matter most. There are three main things to focus on to keep something low calorie while still keeping you satiated until your next meal: protein, fat, and fiber. The Greek yogurt will be good for protein, the oatmeal and banana are kind of okay for fiber. Look for fruits and grains that will get you about 5 grams per serving."

As a moderator of /r/coronavirus, I have to be able to balance the needs of the subreddit versus the wants of the users; and sometimes, the weight of unverified sources or the negative perception people have of moderators based on the actions of few can undermine the foundation we are trying to build.  My decision to impact that thread was important to me, and I feel it was important to the rest of the subreddit to see that we're humans who are still trying to volunteer our time to help our users have a platform to discuss this major issue facing our planet today.

In this case, I'm trying to build a culture of consistency, transparency, and accountability.  I've posted a few times in /r/coronavirus and I get asked if I'm a shill for the CCP.  As a Canadian who just watches hockey, has a three month old at home, and a job as a regional manager in the culinary field, it's a bit amusing because the little free time I have, I spend it on Reddit or with my baby when he's awake.  But it's also an eye opener we no longer live in a world where information can be freely shared as an agency of transparency.  

The best I hope for from our users is that if you feel we are doing something wrong, please let us know.  This is an important topic that affects *everyone*, so please don't hesitate to report these trolls if you feel they are acting out of bad faith, and avoid engaging them as they may want to shift the attention away from the discussion and towards confusion and blurred lines."

As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for human ACE2 receptor binding with an efficient binding solution different to that which would have been predicted. Further, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one would expect that one of the several reverse genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would have been used. However, this is not the case as the genetic data shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone17. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage in culture could have given rise to the same observed features."

Its like “well if you hadn’t left your house in the first place or gone to that party with your friends you wouldn’t have been raped” and thats blaming the victim and I’m not really okay with that. And then she has to live her life with that trauma that she can make no mental connection with deserving so she will just hate herself and let herself believe that by some fault of her existence she deserved it. 

The way the government is treating the victims of coronavirus now in China, they are being treated like criminals not medical patients who are just as scared as everyone else, on top of feeling sick! They didnt ask for it, its not their fault that some old lady at the local market coughed on them. 

This correlates into people thinking that this epidemic is a punishment on China (and the rest of the world)for the treatment of the Ughuirs and ignorance of their plight, and thats twisted thinking too.

Yes, it's true that you're probably, as a random person on Earth, at bigger risk of dying of seasonal flu than coronavirus in the next month.

The part that stirs up our anxiety is that coronavirus may prove to be both more infectious than the flu and more lethal than the flu once infected.  The information that has come out over the last month hasn't done much to settle these fears either.

Perhaps the only hopeful news so far is that with extreme quarantining China has managed to slow the infection rate.  This hasn't stopped it from spreading to other countries.  This doesn't mean other countries will be as successful as China at slowing the spread.  In short, a lot can still go very wrong.  That's anxiety inducing.

The summary makes it sound like people are failing at intuitive statistics.

Maybe the public always overreacts to pandemic scares.  I remember being very unconcerned while people were losing their minds in 2014(?) over ebola.  But coronavirus just can't be discounted yet.  The public, perhaps accidentally, is correctly concerned."

Since it’s still winter and many more people are getting colds thanks to the daily temperature flip flopping around, I’ve been seeing more and more people spitting up phlegm as they walk on the street or while waiting for buses.

Given how the virus can live on surfaces for an extended amount of time, how feasible is it that people can be tracking the coronavirus around the city and surrounding areas via their shoes? Maybe the people who have stepped in the virus-spit don’t wind up contracting it themselves since most people don’t touch their shoes, but if they get on a bus and track it on the floor and then the person behind them gets on, drops their bus card, and touches the floor...

It shows just how little a company gives a shit about their employees. If a normal illness was going around, the company doesn't give two shits and no one wants to spend the money to go to the doctor for a basic illness.

But then H1N1 or Novel Coronavirus hits and /now/ we have to be concerned... suddenly that company policy of ""show up no matter how sick you are"" gets thrown up against the might of the government."
