Article: 

https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/brooklyn-man-arrested-for-hoarding-masks-coughing-on-fbi-agents/

>A Brooklyn man **claiming to be infected with the coronavirus coughed on FBI agents** who were investigating him for hoarding medical supplies, the US Attorney’s Office said Monday.

>Baruch Feldheim, 43, is facing charges of assault and making false statements to the feds on Sunday outside his Borough Park home where he **allegedly peddled and stored massive amounts of N95 respirator masks**, federal officials said.

>Feldheim is also **accused of price-gouging. On March 18, he’s suspected of selling a New Jersey doctor about 1,000 of the masks for $12,000, a markup of roughly 700 percent, authorities said.**

>The accused **fraudster also directed another doctor to an Irvington, NJ, auto repair shop to pick up another order. There, the doctor reported to investigators that Feldheim was allegedly hoarding enough medical supplies “to outfit an entire hospital.”**

>The materials included **hand sanitizers, Clorox wipes, chemical cleaning agents and surgical supplies.**

>By last Monday, Feldheim was operating from his Brooklyn home, **offering to push surgical gowns to a nurse, the feds said.**

>Two days later, the **suspected hoarder received a gigantic shipment at his home of about eight pallets of face masks.**

>FBI agents then staked out his house, first noticing empty boxes of N95 masks outside.

>On Sunday, they said **they witnessed “multiple instances” of people approaching Feldheim’s residence and walking away with what appeared to be medical supplies.**

>The agents confronted Feldheim outside his house, keeping a safe social distance over coronavirus fears.

>“When the agents were within four to five feet of him, **Feldheim allegedly coughed in their direction without covering his mouth,” the US attorney’s release said. “At that point, Feldheim told the FBI agents that that he had the Coronavirus,”** the statement said.

>Feldheim then **allegedly lied to FBI agents regarding his possession and sale of medical supplies.**

>**He falsely told the agents that he worked for a company that bought and sold PPE and that he never took physical custody of the materials.**

>Following Feldheim’s arrest, the **FBI on Monday night raided a warehouse on Pennsylvania Avenue in an industrial section of Linden, NJ, that housed Feldhim’s suspected stash of 80,000 masks, a source said.**

>Mask-wearing agents and other workers placed the eight pallets of medical supplies into a box truck.

Anyone who believes anything US ""intelligence"" says is a fool. US has been engaged in a ""blame China"" campaign all week to distract from the US government's shoddy performance. The goal is just to keep people focused on China. 

As a European, what I know is that virtually every European country has received supplies from China, including my home nation of Ireland. Hotspots like Italy and Spain have received teams of doctors and medics. 

What has the US done? Well they spent [the G-7](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/mike-pompeo-g7-coronavirus-149425) trying to get the word Coronavirus replaced with Wuhan virus. Tried to [steal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal) a potential vaccine from Germany. Used the [US military](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127511/PICTURED-Air-Force-flies-500-000-coronavirus-testing-kits-Italy-quiet-Reach-911-mission.html) to fly out half a million testing kits 
from Italy because their own CDC kits didn't work. 

Generally US hasn't helped any nation because they cannot even help themselves. 

But one thing the US has been busy doing is shit-talking China, and this while there own nurses in New York wear bin bags because they don't have any PPE.

China or Chinese companies have now donated supplies to all 54 Africans nations. Sent teams and supplies to both Iran and Iraq. Sold or supplied a majority of Europe with supplies and doctors. Working with Cuba on an Anti-viral treatment and sent millions of masks to South Korea, Japan, and just today Laos.

If this was regular hoarding, he’s within his rights to do so. Given our present situation, I’d condemn him to hell for doing it, but it’s technically legal. The FBI taking it away IF it was the case of simply hoarding, is stealing, and breaking the law. 

That being said, this guy was confirmed to be price gouging, which is illegal, and he should get it all confiscated and given to where it’s needed and he should face a hefty fine and jail time IMO.

>President Trump signed an executive order Monday aimed at preventing price gouging and hoarding of critical medical supplies amid the coronavirus outbreak.


>Attorney General William Barr detailed the executive order at a White House briefing Monday evening, saying it would prohibit people from accumulating **critical supplies amid the coronavirus outbreak in an effort to profit off of them.**


>Barr said the Department of Justice (DOJ) had seen potential evidence of hoarding and price gouging amid the pandemic.


>**Trump is authorized under the Defense Production Act to prohibit hoarding of needed resources by designating them as scarce or threatened by people accumulating excessive amounts,** Barr said.


>The executive order signed by Trump on Monday gives Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar the authority to designate certain supplies as critical, meaning those found to be hoarding or price gouging such equipment could face criminal action, Barr said.


>“Once specific materials are so designated, persons are prohibited from accumulating those items in excess of reasonable personal or business needs or for the purpose of selling them in excess of prevailing market prices,” Barr said.


>“It is a crime to engage in prohibited activity,” the attorney general continued.


>**No materials have been designated as critical,** Barr said, but the DOJ and HHS are working together to identify possible cases where hoarding is hampering response efforts amid the coronavirus outbreak."

To add just a couple more details:

1929 fell for 5 weeks about 20%, then cut those losses in half before a week of hesitation, and then a massive fall off the cliff.

2020: We also fell for five weeks, and last week had a semi-recovery. This week is also red (so far).

If history is doomed to repeat itself, then next week would be the relative week of absolute devastation. According to history, we possibly haven't even had a crash yet. VS has said multiple times that he is waiting to see what happens today and tomorrow. I believe the next days' clues will guide us into knowing whether VS's predictions (which totally guided my deductions) are destined to be true.

I do see evidence supporting large powers guiding this situation into a downward trend:

1. Trump decidedly changed his tone yesterday to doom and gloom. It certainly scared me, and I've been a pessimistic realist this whole time. This also could have been an alternative strategy to get people to stay inside, since he failed to get a quarantine in the NJ, NY, CT region.
2. If JPow was determined to pump the market through this crisis, why would he let it drop this week? Is it possible the feds just wanted to give banks and higher ups a chance to get out before the real crash happens?
3. The whole mortgage INVESTMENT market is not included in the stimulus bill([Nathan Tankus](https://nathantankus.substack.com/), [Smart Redditor explains investor market for mortgages](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/friwc9/mortgage_servicing_crisis_explained/)) . Here is my retarded thinking: If people don't get checks until late April, AND a lot of people are having a hard time getting solid unemployment checks ([People are having a hard time getting unemployment](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/01/unemployment-for-gig-self-employed-workers-mired-in-confusion-delays.html), [People who lie about tips will get screwed on unemployment](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/heres-who-wont-qualify-for-beefed-up-coronavirus-unemployment-relief.html)) , then fear for the state of the mortgage market will drive a sustained bear market until the virus is contained.

Overall, as VS has said, the next 24-48 hours will give us a lot of clues about how next week will go.

SPY 4/15 195p, 170p, 135p, and will probably switch to May expiry at some point.

Edit: My positions are terrible, but they are what I could afford and I am not switching now unless VS tells me to directly lol My strategy is for VIX to spike and then I will sell to get closer OTM. My ideal price is in the range of 200-220."

I’ve observed that in most countries where Coronavirus has taken hold people exhibited some absolutely bizarre behavior - especially in the lead up to the big die off (where USA is poised today) and just before people manifest severe symptoms. Some of the things I saw coming from China and Malaysia were very bizarre - people smearing snot on elevator buttons and laughing when neighbors touched them - deliberately trying to sicken strangers after receiving a diagnosis - and yesterday I heard an interview with an NYC ER doctor saying COVID19 victims were exhibiting all sorts of unexpected side effects like hallucinations and fainting.

We talked about this before here and the suggestion is this might have something to do with desaturation and hypoxia, but it does seem like COVID19 has some unknown and serious neurological effects."

Her Dad has tested positive for COVID-19. He had lung surgery 30+ years ago and now the virus is attacking his kidneys. The doctors are saying that his only fighting chance is if they can find someone who was tested positive for COVID-19 and then beat it and tested negative - who would be willing to donate blood via the Red Cross. This is because antibodies are built up to fight COVID-19. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE if you know anyone who fits this description have them reach out to the Red Cross immediately. They could be saving my friend’s Dad’s life and many others.

And President Trump's response, or lack of, is a a disgrace. Like China, he tried to censor it too - he forced the CDC to get his administration's approval before they can issue any statements in an attempt to hide how serious this is. And here's videos of him and Fox News calling it a hoax and claiming ""mainstream media"" is hyping up the virus to attack Trump - downplaying it instead of preparing our nation for something that we knew, for months, was coming:

https://youtu.be/ifKbwDf51bA

https://youtu.be/ch7_t2Ri2Zg

Because of his mishandling of the crisis, America is now the new epicenter of the virus.  Even now, there's no leadership from Trump. Every state is pretty much left to fend for themselves. And in order to get federal aid, states has to feed his ego or else he'll leave Americans in that state to die. He's literally refusing to take calls from Governors who refuses to worship him and directing the Coronavirus Response Team to do the same. Instead of getting the the ventilators states desperately need, he's feuding with the begging Governors telling them they don't need it and to show appreciation to him for the ""great job"" he's doing. And every day he shares misinformation on TV and on Twitter - misinformation doctors from his own administration has to issue corrections for afterwards. His careless comments have led to critical shortages of malaria medicine and even needless death.

Meanwhile, every other country in the world have a coordinated, nationwide response to the virus. South Korea got the virus at the same time as us and they've already got it under control and life is slowly returning to normal there. Meanwhile for the United States, because of Trump's gross mishandling of the virus, the worse is yet to come.

And instead of focusing on dealing with the crisis, he's also busy on Twitter deflecting blame/distracting by issuing divisive and xenophobic statements that put Asian Americans at risk.  So as an Asian American, in addition to dealing with the virus and the loss of income I'm suffering from because of the virus, I also have to deal with the ignorant people that's been emboldened by him.

Great job you're doing there, President Trump (sarcasm). And if I'm a ""sheep"" or a ""shrill"" for feeling this way, so be it.

Also, thank you Governor Sisolak."

Disclaimer: I have nothing against orphans. Orphans should find a happy home and find loving parents. But Stuart is a fucking mouse. All animals are able to talk in the film yet only humans can understand Stuart. Stuart Little is given the same rights as a human being just because he can talk AND humans can understand him. But do these rights go over to characters like Snowbell or Monty? No.

Despite many animals in the film showing self awareness and the ability to emulate emotion and have deep levels of complex thinking on par with humans, only Stuart Little is recognized to have this level of cognitive ability on par with humans. This is an unfair advantage and Stuart Little just steps aside while Snowbell is treated like a typical animal. He doesn't even try to advocate for Snowbell or other characters. They are treated like pets. Yes. How is it that a fucking mouse gets to amass all of this privilege and refuses to stick up for Snowbell and advocate for his rights?!

In fact, extrapolating from the film I am sure that Stuart Little can probably start to vote when he turns 18. This dumb fucking mouse can participate in society and be seen as an equal by humans. All because he has the privilege of being able to talk to humans. Clearly Snowbell has demonstrated that he can process complicated levels of morals and abstract thoughts yet Snowbell will never be seen as an equal in the eyes of society.

Stuart Little is an allegory for white privilege but they mask this in the form of a cute mouse. It's actually an allusion to how wh\*tes benefit from society. Think about it. A wh\*te mouse has been given more benefit of the doubt compared to his ""inferior"" animal counterparts who are treated as invisible to society and treated as house pets. Notice how they treat Snowbell and assume that Snowbell would hurt Stuart Little based on his species. Clearly the Littles like to make unfair assumptions on different species and refuse to recognize their biases. Why are the cats portrayed as mafia villains HMMM??? Why is Snowbell the token good cat in the film who aides Stuart Little and yet Stuart refuses to advocate for his animal friend. Just some things to think about.

Also Stuart Little is the reason for the Coronavirus and Andrew Cuomo needs to do the right thing and apprehend this criminal. Malarkey level of Stuart Little causing the Coronavirus!"

The world’s second-biggest cigarette maker claims to have made a “significant breakthrough” in the race to find a vaccine for the coronavirus and would be ready to start mass production within three months.

British American Tobacco (BAT), the FTSE 100 company behind Lucky Strike and Dunhill, said it could be producing up to 3m million doses of a vaccine a week by June - far faster than rivals, which are expecting to take at least a year.

 BAT intends to start trialling its vaccine in humans as soon as possible. It is running pre-clinical tests and holding urgent talks with US drug authorities to fast-track permissions.

The treatment is being developed by the company's health division Kentucky BioProcessing (KBP), which has previously come up with a drug to combat Ebola. It claims to have found an antibody that appears to fight Covid-19, and is manufacturing this using genetically modified tobacco plants.

City analysts called the announcement “somewhat surprising”. Shares rose 4pc. 

More established medical firms have said the timeline for delivering a vaccine is far slower.

The company has opened talks with the Department for Health as well as US regulators. “BAT is now exploring partnerships with government agencies to bring its vaccine to clinical studies as soon as possible.""


Owen Bennett of Jefferies said: ""It helps to illustrate the scientific sophistication at big tobacco.""

If the scheme is successful it will give BAT's reputation a massive boost, he added.

BAT's scientific research director David O’Reilly said: “Vaccine development is challenging and complex work, but we believe we have made a significant break-through with our tobacco plant technology platform and stand ready to work with governments and all stakeholders to help win the war against Covid-19.

“KBP has been exploring alternative uses of the tobacco plant for some time. One such alternative use is the development of plant-based vaccines. We are committed to contributing to the global effort to halt the spread of Covid-19 using this technology.”

BAT is not alone in turning its attention to developing a vaccine. Earlier this week US consumer goods giant Johnson & Johnson announced a $1bn (£810m) deal with Washington to ramp up testing."

On March 27, 2020, the president signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act (“CARES Act”) into law. The law includes important, immediate protections for tenants and
homeowners. The federal eviction moratorium for tenants living in certain types of housing is
summarized below. NHLP is working on a separate analysis regarding the provisions for
homeowners.
I. What does the federal eviction moratorium do?
The eviction moratorium operates by restricting lessors of covered properties (discussed in more
detail below) from filing new eviction actions for non-payment of rent, and also prohibits
“charg[ing] fees, penalties, or other charges to the tenant related to such nonpayment of rent.”
Sec. 4024(b). The federal moratorium also provides that a lessor (of a covered property) may not
evict a tenant after the moratorium expires except on 30 days’ notice—which may not be given
until after the moratorium period. See Sec. 4024(c).
The federal eviction moratorium does not affect cases:
a) that were filed before the moratorium took effect or that are filed after it sunsets
b) that involve non-covered tenancies (see below), or
c) where the eviction is based on another reason besides nonpayment of rent or
nonpayment of other fees or charges.
The moratorium does not explicitly state whether evictions “for nonpayment of rent or other fees
or charges” includes evictions motivated by a tenant’s nonpayment of rent (or other fees or
charges) but formally based on a “no-cause” lease termination notice or refusal to renew a term
tenancy. Sec. 4024(b)(1). However, advocates should assert that the moratorium bars the filing
of any eviction case that is motivated (wholly or in part) by a tenant’s nonpayment of rent or
other fees or charges, whether or not the action is formally based on such non-payment.
Allowing landlords to skirt the moratorium by using “no cause” eviction cases for delinquent
rent or fees would frustrate the purpose of the statute. And, such a reading would lead to an
absurd result, because a landlord could more quickly and easily evict a tenant without cause
during the moratorium period than after the moratorium expires (at which point a 30-day notice
would be required)."
2020-04-01,uddane,Coronavirus,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ft3n6k/the_list_of_those_who_wont_get_a_1200_stimulus/fm4tygr/,"The Trump administration is requiring Americans who receive Social Security to file a tax return to receive their $1,200 economic stimulus payment, an added step that is causing confusion and could prevent millions from easy access to relief.

Many lawmakers and advocates for the poor say filing a tax return shouldn’t be necessary for people on Social Security because the government already knows how to send this population monthly checks. The [$2.2 trillion aid legislation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/senate-stimulus-bill-coronavirus-2-trillion-list-what-is-in-it/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3), passed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, said that if someone has not filed a 2019 or 2018 tax return, the U.S. Treasury should get their information from Social Security, if applicable.

But, the Internal Revenue Service posted a[ notice ](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)on its website on Monday instructing Social Security recipients to file a “simple” tax return, which will be available soon.

“People who typically do not file a tax return will need to file a simple tax return to receive an economic impact payment,"" the IRS said. “Low-income taxpayers, senior citizens, Social Security recipients, some veterans and individuals with disabilities who are otherwise not required to file a tax return will not owe tax.”

[*Calculate how much you’ll get from the $1,200 (or more) coronavirus checks*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_8&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_8)

A request to the Treasury Department for comment about the discrepancy was not returned. Democrats are upset that the Trump administration isn’t doing more to help ensure that as many Americans as possible get these payments during this national health emergency.

Thirty-four senators sent the White House a [letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/454381264/Hassan-Brown-Letter) Wednesday asking why the Trump administration is placing this “significant burden” on senior citizens and the disabled. Members of the House are also speaking out.

[*Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.*](https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/health?method=SURL&location=ART_IS&tid=lk_interstitial_manual_13&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_13)

“My colleagues and I strongly urge Treasury Secretary \[Steven\] Mnuchin and Social Security Administrator \[Andrew\] Saul to find a solution that will allow vulnerable groups to receive these funds automatically, without needing to file an additional return,"" said Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

More than 15 million Americans on Social Security do not file an annual tax return because their income is so low, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. During the last recession, when the U.S. government sent most Americans a stimulus check and required a filed tax return to get it, 3.5 million Social Security recipients were left out because they never sent a return, according to a 2008 Treasury Department [analysis](https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2008reports/200840149fr.pdf).

There is concern that even more people won’t file during the pandemic. Many older Americans are worried about their health and safety, and it’s harder to get help with a tax return while stuck at home.

[*Here’s how to get a small business loan under the $349 billion aid bill*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/30/heres-how-get-small-business-loan-under-349-billion-coronavirus-aid-bill/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_19&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_19)

“There is no need for Treasury to require those millions of Social Security recipients to file,” said Chye-Ching Huang, a tax expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “We just hope it’s a misunderstanding and they clear it up quickly. It’s a really simple fix.”

Congress and Treasury wanted to get the money out as quickly as possible, so they largely based the rules governing who gets the payments on the standards used in 2008, in the hope the IRS could move faster. With so many millions of Americans out of work, the Trump administration is under pressure to quickly deliver these [$1,200 payments to adults ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/senate-stimulus-bill-coronavirus-2-trillion-list-what-is-in-it/?tid=lk_inline_manual_21&itid=lk_inline_manual_21)earning less than $75,000 a year and $500 payments to families with children under 17.

Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said direct deposits should begin by April 17, followed by checks in the mail. About 60 percent of tax filers gave the IRS direct deposit information in recent years, according to Nicole Kaeding of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. The IRS said there would soon be a web-based portal for people to update their direct deposit information.

Beyond the tax-filing hurdle, millions of other Americans are realizing they don’t qualify for a [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_25&itid=lk_inline_manual_25) relief check.

Most high school seniors and college students won’t get any money. The bill gives $0 to families with children older than 16, a shock to many households already reeling from canceled graduations, and college youths readjusting to life at home with so many universities shut down. Many immigrant families are also learning that they are ineligible. In order for anyone in the family to receive a payment, each person in the household is supposed to have a valid Social Security number.

Nick Guerrero of Mesa, Ariz., has learned he’s one of those who won’t be getting any money since he’s 18, another blow to his high school senior year that is quickly unraveling.

On Sunday night, Guerrero was video chatting with a dozen friends and they laughed at the thought of having to do virtual prom and getting their high school diplomas via email. It still seemed unreal. On Monday, they woke up to the news that school was canceled for the rest of the year in Arizona.

“It was like a shot to the heart,” Guerrero said.

Some of his friends have lost their after-school jobs. He planned to get one soon to help save for college, but that is no longer possible. He has been applying for college scholarships, but some applications require him to use a fax machine or send a hard copy of his paperwork, and he no longer has access to the school printer.

Money is tight and his family had to borrow funds from a relative to pay for his Advanced Placement tests this spring. His parents — an education professor and a golf coach — expect to receive the government relief payment in April, which should help, but they won’t get $500 for him.

Guerrero trades text messages on a massive chain with about 25 friends — classmates he hasn’t seen since spring break started on March 6.

https://www.waynedupree.com/man-arrested-hoarding-n95-masks/


Important bits: 

> On Sunday, Baruch Feldheim, 43, was arrested and charged with making false statements to the feds where he allegedly peddled and stored massive amounts of N95 respirator masks from his NY home.
FBI officials claimed that Feldheim marked up 1000 masks at 700 percent, selling them for $12,000. According to a doctor that got caught up in Feldheim’s scheme, he told the investigators that the suspect was allegedly hoarding enough medical supplies “to outfit an entire hospital.”

> “When the agents were within four to five feet of him, Feldheim allegedly coughed in their direction without covering his mouth,” the US attorney’s release said. “At that point, Feldheim told the FBI agents that he had the Coronavirus,” the statement said.
Feldheim then allegedly lied to FBI agents regarding his possession and sale of medical supplies.
He falsely told the agents that he worked for a company that bought and sold PPE and that he never took physical custody of the materials.
Following Feldheim’s arrest, the FBI on Monday night raided a warehouse on Pennsylvania Avenue in an industrial section of Linden, NJ, that housed Feldhim’s suspected stash of 80,000 masks, a source said."

This is a religious mob pelting stones on health officials who went there to screen these locals.

This screening is being done because there has emerged a cluster in india which is threatening the entire nation after some average rise in corona virus positive cases in last few days.

Recent surge in cases is due to an international religious conference which happened in delhi 2 weeks ago.

Many ppl who attended that conference have tested positive for coronavirus. Indians from a particular community who were infected there went back to their respective states and might have infected others too. 

Most new cases coming up in india are related to this conference.

This conference was illegal and it had many religious scholars who came from 15+ different countries to preach their religion.

>Sansom, who recently lost his job as a heavy-machinery mechanic due to coronavirus-related layoffs, was out hunting with Cardinal to help provide food for family members.

>After successfully shooting a moose, which promised a bountiful supply of meat, the two took a selfie, smiling in the woods. Both men were Métis – a distinct group that traces lineage to both Indigenous nations and European settlers – and had permission to hunt the area out of season.

>News of the murders has shocked friends and family.

>“All the kids in the community loved him and everyone knew who he was, knew he had a heart of gold and would give the shirt off his back for anyone,” Sarah Sansom said of her husband in a statement. A volunteer firefighter, he left behind three young children.

>“Firefighter Sansom was always willing to be involved in the dept, community, fundraisers, and continually showed his love for his family and fellow firefighters,” the Nobleford fire department said in a Facebook post.

>Cardinal, a keen hunter and outdoorsman, had three stepchildren and five grandchildren.

>“One day I was complaining about my feet being cold and the next morning he showed up with a nice warm pair of brand new socks for me! Took them straight from his stash of socks,” Anna Thompson, who previously worked with Cardinal, told the National Post.

>The results of an autopsy conducted on the two men on Tuesday 31 March were not made public. The RCMP declined to provide information on the number or nature of gunshot wounds, citing a need to “preserve the integrity” of the investigation.

>Police have said they believe the men were ambushed at a junction – but cautioned the investigation was in its preliminary stages. The RCMP said there was no evidence at this point that suggested the killings were racially motivated.

>Police have appealed to anyone with dashboard or trail camera footage from the area to come forward.

>“I just don’t get why somebody could murder two people for no reason like that,” Michel Sansom, Jake’s brother, told CBC News. “They didn’t rob them. The cops said nothing was missing. They pulled up just to kill them, just because. I just don’t understand that.”

COVID-19 has a mortality rate of 0.4% in those under the age of 50 and it gets lower the younger you are. That is 0.4%.

A little less than three weeks ago, when the number of people infected with the COVID-19 virus began to spike, Mikael Laboy found himself in a tough spot. The 21-year-old’s job at a biotechnology company in Puerto Rico required him to work in close proximity to his coworkers, and he says his employer wasn’t taking enough precautions to keep them safe. Since he lives with his brother and sister-in-law, who is pregnant, he felt he couldn’t risk accidentally bringing the infection home. So he quit. “There’s people living in my household that I can’t put at risk,” he says.

It was a difficult decision and bills have been stacking up, but recently, there seemed to be a glimmer of hope. On March 27, President Trump signed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that includes the direct infusion of cash to the majority of Americans—including Laboy. The provision stipulates that any American with a Social Security number who isn’t considered someone else’s dependent and makes up to $75,000 will receive a payment of $1,200.

That means that Laboy, who says he has been struggling economically for three years, would catch a much-needed break. “I’ve been sleeping on the floor for years, being in houses with no furniture, beds, et cetera,” he says. “I’ve had weeks where I spend two or three days without eating just to stretch out the food as much as I can.” For him, the stimulus funds would be a game-changer.

The problem now is how Laboy actually gets his hands on that money. While the text of the stimulus bill does not stipulate how the checks should be delivered, or within what timeframe, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has emphasized the need for speed. On March 29, he said checks would be delivered to the people who have their bank account information on file with the Internal Revenue Service “within three weeks.”

But that doesn’t help Laboy. Like 14.1 million other Americans, he doesn’t have a bank account. And that’s a huge problem. People without bank accounts — the “unbanked,” as they’re known — are often among the poorest. Roughly 53% of people without bank accounts say they don’t have them because they “do not have enough money to keep in an account,” according to a 2017 FDIC survey. That means that the unbanked are the most in need of a direct stimulus check, but will be the last ones who actually receive it.



“This particular element is going to hit lower income people much more than higher income people,” says Jonathan Morduch, the executive director of NYU’s Financial Access Initiative. “They really have a double whammy—their incomes are being hit, and also the mechanism to help them is going to take longer.”







It’s unclear when Laboy and other unbanked Americans will receive their checks. The U.S. Treasury Department did not respond to multiple requests for a more exact timeline. In 2008, one of the last times the federal government issued direct stimulus checks, taxpayers with direct deposit accounts mostly received their $600-$1,200 funds 12 weeks after the bill passed, within the first half of May 2008, according to the Tax Foundation, an independent nonprofit. Some taxpayers without direct deposit, however, didn’t receive theirs until mid-July: 20 weeks after the bill passed.

A Republican aide acknowledged that such delays are possible for those who don’t have bank information on file with the IRS. “The goal will be to send money as quickly as possible. So, if [the] IRS has direct deposit information on file, they will use that. That would be the quickest way,” Michael Zona, a spokesperson for Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee that wrote this portion of the stimulus package, said in an email to TIME. “For those who don’t have direct deposit, a check would have to be mailed, which may take a bit longer.” The New York Times has reported that this could take up to four months.

A wide swath of Americans are eligible for direct payments allotted in the stimulus package. The income threshold rises to $112,500 for the head of a household, and $150,000 for a couple filing jointly. (Any family with dependent children in that income bracket will receive a $500 payment per child). Income thresholds will be determined based on either 2018 or 2019 tax returns, whichever is the most recent.

In the absence of a quicker solution, online payment services like Venmo and Cash App have offered their services to the federal government, according to CNN. People do not need to have bank accounts to sign up for Venmo and Cash App accounts. Critics point out that these apps are still relatively new, and doling out funds on a massive scale through their platforms could create a logistical nightmare. But others argue that many unbanked Americans can’t afford to wait.


If the stimulus checks are mailed the old-fashioned way—through the United States Postal Service—there could be a silver lining, says John Caskey, an economics professor at Swarthmore College. The mailed checks could give unbanked people who have so far failed to meet minimum amount thresholds at nearby banks an opportunity to finally open an accounts. At Wells Fargo, Everyday Checking Account customers have to meet a $1,500 minimum balance or meet other age, deposit, student status, or transaction requirements to avoid a monthly service fee. Similar provisions exist at Chase Bank.

But for people like Laboy, that’s a far-off fantasy. If his $1,200 stimulus money arrives this summer, he’s probably not going to want to go to the bank, and set up an account. Plus, if that wasn’t enough, he’d have to wait for the check to clear."

If someone test positive and is either in quarantine or hospitalized as a result, and then coincidentally has a heart attack and drops dead, is that being counted as a death from Coronavirus or a death from a heart attack?"

Stem cells are a young industry with tons of failures. Some of these spikes we've seen are from poorly-formed early partnerships with majors like Pfizer making a guess on a chronic disease like ulcerative colitis with a single small dose. Makes no sense on its face, right? Well that's what happened  and the partnership ended. That was 2013.

Couple years later, the Phase 2 Ischemic Stroke trial results come out, and it fails primary endpoints. Problem is that there were issues with the placebo, as well as manufacturing early on in that study so they extended the time window of treatment from 36 to 48 hours. In the under 36 hour cohort, there were incredible successes at 90 days, in the 36-48 hour cohort at 90 days out from treatment it did not meat statistical significance. In the 365-day review, however, everyone showed meaningful improvement. That was 2015.

A phase 2 trial is built for signal of efficacy and safety, and to model what a phase 3 trial should do to confirm the results. That's where they're at now. Healios has gone ""All in"" as a partner in Japan, and someone with that capability of investment who is inside the bubble of corporate information and still makes major purchases is a very strong indicator that something big is about to happen.

&#x200B;

Healios just started their marketing department today, Athersys hired a CFO and a VP of manufacturing recently. It has taken years of preparation, with many hiccups along the way, but we are exactly on the path to being a major success.

Finally, the CEO Gil has NEVER sold a single share. People on this board have given conservative, and I stress conservative, estimates of the potential for what a price-per-treatment and market coverage is for Ischemic Stroke here, in the EU, Japan and potentially China or others, and the shareprice always seems to come out in the $100-$200 or more range. That's just stroke. We're not even talking about ARDS, or TBI, or some other potentials that are out there on the periphery.

This is no joke, it's hard to wrap our heads around that it is succeeding so quickly the last few weeks, but we've trusted the company and while their PR is not always perfect, their Multistem may just be the holy grail of medicine. Athersys has been in on a Coronavirus response since January and we all recently only heard about it a few weeks ago. They're not trying to retrofit their treatment to fit Covid-19, they already had it focused on ARDS for YEARS prior. They're like the kid in the back of the classroom with his hand quietly raised while all his classmates are hooting and hollering and all get the answer wrong. If that doesn't tell you they're serious about doing the hard work behind the scenes...

Anyway, yes we've been burned before on timelines, but it was always real and we've learned to trust the science. It isn't just the raw results of 'did someone get better' or not, it's the actual cellular-level biomarker data that shows that Multistem works."

2020-04-01,Vohtarak,Coronavirus,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ft6emn/the_coronavirus_patients_betrayed_by_their_own/fm58x4v/,"A “cytokine storm” becomes an all-too-frequent phenomenon, particularly among the young. But treatments are being tested.

The 42-year-old man arrived at a hospital in Paris on March 17 with a fever, cough and the “ground glass opacities” in both lungs that are a trademark of infection with the new coronavirus.

Two days later, his condition suddenly worsened and his oxygen levels dropped. His body, doctors suspected, was in the grip of a cytokine storm, a dangerous overreaction of the immune system. The phenomenon has become all too common in the coronavirus pandemic, but it is also pointing to potentially helpful drug treatments.

When the body first encounters a virus or a bacterium, the immune system ramps up and begins to fight the invader. The foot soldiers in this fight are molecules called cytokines that set off a cascade of signals to cells to marshal a response. Usually, the stronger this immune response, the stronger the chance of vanquishing the infection, which is partly why children and younger people are less vulnerable over all to coronavirus. And once the enemy is defeated, the immune system is hard-wired to shut itself off.

“For most people and most infections, that’s what happens,” said Dr. Randy Cron, an expert on cytokine storms at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

But in some cases — as much as 15 percent of people battling any serious infection, according to Dr. Cron’s team — the immune system keeps raging long after the virus is no longer a threat. It continues to release cytokines that keep the body on an exhausting full alert. In their misguided bid to keep the body safe, these cytokines attack multiple organs including the lungs and liver, and may eventually lead to death.

In these people, it’s their body’s response, rather than the virus, that ultimately causes harm.

Cytokine storms can overtake people of any age, but some scientists believe that they may explain why healthy young people died during the 1918 pandemic and more recently during the SARS, MERS and H1N1 epidemics. They are also a complication of various autoimmune diseases like lupus and Still’s disease, a form of arthritis. And they may offer clues as to why otherwise healthy young people with coronavirus infection are succumbing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, a common consequence of a cytokine storm.

Reports from China and Italy have described young patients with clinical outcomes that seem consistent with this phenomenon. It’s very likely that some of these patients developed a cytokine storm, Dr. Cron said.

In the case of the 42-year-old patient, the suspected cytokine storm led his doctors to eventually try tocilizumab, a drug they have sometimes used to soothe an immune system in distress.

After just two doses of the drug, spaced eight hours apart, the patient’s fever rapidly disappeared, his oxygen levels rose and a chest scan showed his lungs clearing. The case report, described in an upcoming paper in Annals of Oncology, joins dozens of accounts from Italy and China, all indicating that tocilizumab might be an effective antidote to the coronavirus in some people.

On March 5, China approved the drug to treat serious cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and authorized clinical trials. On March 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval to the pharmaceutical company Roche to test the drug in hundreds of people with coronavirus infection.

Tocilizumab is approved to quieten the chatter of immune molecules in rheumatoid arthritis and in some types of cancer. It mutes the activity of a specific cytokine called interleukin-6 that is associated with an over-exuberant immune response.

“That’s the rationale for using the drug,” said Dr. Laurence Albiges, who cared for the patient at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center in Paris.

Even as researchers look for treatments, they are trying to learn more about why some people’s immune systems go into this dangerous overdrive. Genetic factors explain the risk, at least in some kinds of cytokine storms.

There are many variations on the phenomenon, and they go by many names: systemic inflammatory response syndrome, cytokine release syndrome, macrophage activation syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Broadly speaking, they are all marked by an unbridled surge in immune molecules, and may all result in the fatal shutdown of multiple organs.

But many doctors are unfamiliar with this niche concept or how to treat it, experts said.

“Everyone’s talking about cytokine storm as if it were a well-recognized phenomenon, but you could have asked medics two weeks ago and they wouldn’t have heard of it,” said Dr. Jessica Manson, an immunologist at University College London Hospital.

A patient battling a cytokine storm may have an abnormally fast heart rate, fever and a drop in blood pressure. Apart from a surge in interleukin-6, the body may also show high swirling levels of molecules called interleukin-1, interferon-gamma, C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.

This storm, if it develops, becomes obvious a few days into the infection. But the sooner doctors catch on to it and treat it, the more likely the patient is to survive. Too late, and the storm may be beyond control, or may already have caused too much damage.

There is a relatively simple, rapid and easily available test that can detect whether a patient’s body has been taken over by a cytokine storm. It looks for high levels of a protein called ferritin.

But if the test does suggest a cytokine storm is underway, what then?

The seemingly obvious solution is to quell the storm, Dr. Cron said: “If it’s the body’s response to the infection that’s killing you, you need to treat that.”

The reality is trickier, especially given the lack of reliable data for Covid-19. But noting that drugs like tocilizumab are taken regularly by people with arthritis, Dr. Cron said the benefit would probably outweigh potential harm if someone is facing death.

“We need evidence-based data, but in a pandemic, where we’re flying by the seat of our pants, we always have to treat the patient in front of us,” he said.

Other drugs might also be useful against cytokine storms. For example, a drug called anakinra mutes interleukin-1, another of the wayward proteins. Clinical trials of anakinra for Covid-19 are also underway. A report published this week suggested that hydroxychloroquine, a much-spotlighted malaria drug that also calms an overactive immune response, might also be effective as a treatment for those who are mildly ill from coronavirus.

Doctors could also turn to corticosteroids, which broadly turn down the entire immune response. That poses its own danger, by exposing the patient to other opportunistic infections, especially in a hospital. “It’s about getting the balance right between suppression of the over-exuberant immune response and still allowing the immune response to fight the virus,” Dr. Manson said.

A group of experts convened two weeks ago to discuss the best ways to collect more data and to treat patients who appear to have cytokine storm. It’s already clear that the complexities of the immune system and the course of coronavirus mean there is no single best treatment.

At the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, doctors treated another coronavirus patient with tocilizumab. That individual did not show any improvement with the drug.

“The response to the pathogen, the virus, is totally different in different individuals,” said Dr. Fabrice André, an oncologist at the center. “The trials will determine in which patients it works.” 

Edit: I love the nytimes. Yes they have a bias against Bernie, but they are one of the few sites that doesn't use clickbait titles and actually has in depth analysis. Some of their writers aren't that great, but I feel they have more integrity than many others overall.

Just look at the titles of articles on their front page and compare their titles to other major news sites. Nytimes doesn't use fear tactics. That to me means they care about a genuine discourse indeed of scarring people."

Henry Ford Health System is reporting an unusual case of encephalitis associated with COVID-19.

In a case report published online Tuesday in the journal Radiology, a team of doctors say a patient who tested positive for the coronavirus developed a case of acute necrotizing encephalitis, or ANE, a central nervous infection that mostly afflicts young children.

The 58-year-old female patient is hospitalized in serious condition.

This case report is believed to be the first published case highlighting the association between encephalitis and COVID-19.

“This is significant for all providers to be aware of and looking out for in patients who present with an altered level of consciousness. We need to be thinking of how we’re going to incorporate patients with severe neurological disease into our treatment paradigm,” says Elissa Fory, M.D. a Henry Ford neurologist who was part of the team of medical experts involved in making the diagnosis. “This complication is as devastating as severe lung disease.”

The team involved neuroradiologist Brent Griffith, M.D., infectious diseases physician Pallavi Bhargava, M.D., and neurologists Shaneela Malik, M.D. and Poonam Bansal, M.D.

Dr. Griffith, senior author of the published case report, says the paper shows “the important role that imaging can play in COVID-19 cases.”

ANE is a rare condition, particularly in the adult population, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. It develops in response to other infections like influenza, chickenpox and enterovirus.

The patient had several days of fever, cough and muscle aches – symptoms consistent with COVID-19. On March 19, she was transported by ambulance to the emergency department and showed signs of confusion, lethargy and disorientation, Dr. Fory says. A flu test turned up negative but a rapid COVID-19 test, developed in-house by Henry Ford’s clinical microbiology lab, confirmed positive coronavirus.

When the patient remained lethargic, doctors ordered a repeat CT and MRI scans. The MRI scan identified abnormal lesions in both thalami and temporal lobes, parts of the brain that control consciousness, sensation and memory function. These scans confirmed doctors’ early suspicions.

“The team had suspected encephalitis at the outset, but then back-to-back CT and MRI scans made the diagnosis,” Dr. Fory says."

Thats probably as close to the truth as we will get on this. I think they all looked around at stockpiles and gathered data and said shit.... then they realized that this admin would be completely ineffective at even distributing what we have. 

It can't both be true that you don't need one if you're not sick and also we don't know who is sick because it shows up 4-5 days (avg) after exposure and up to 14 AND also we aren't testing enough people. 

The very basics of what they were saying was stupid. They made it sound like it's only if you cough or sneeze on people knowing that wasn't true. If that were the case then we should have been putting masks on the potential cases that came in. Obviously not ventilator patients, but why did healthcare workers at hospitals need masks so much so that we were told not to buy any? 

Remember that bad flu in 2017? People were super sick, the flu shot and testing failed, it was bad. I got it bad and went to a large clinic in Austin and every entrance had signs advising people to put on a mask if they may be ill or immunocompromised. Then coronavirus comes along and is much worse, suddenly you don't need a mask unless you test positive. But they also don't really have tests for it either. The real difference also is we know what to expect with the flu so younger people might forego a mask like in that 2017 flu because you'll nearly always get over the flu unscathed. The consequences here are not having enough medicine for everyone, not having ventilators for a good enough amount that might need them, and death.

Sorry to rant, thats just one of the worst things about what they did here. Coming out with even a homemade mask design and recommending them could have preempted the buying up of masks for healthcare workers. Instead they lied and now there aren't enough masks for the healthcare workers and also not enough for the public. It boils down to if more people had worn them, less would have coronavirus, which would reduce the need for n95 and other PPE that healthcare workers did not have. I realize it was an attempt to maybe help the healthcare workers, but the truth is hospitals aren't buying their n95 masks or surgical masks at home depot and CVS in the first place. Those are bulk ordered. As a result neither the public nor healthcare workers have any and everyone is getting sick."

Their rationale is that the high viral RNA load in fecal samples is indicative of actively replicating virus. However, there remains the possibility that passage through the gut does render SARS-CoV-2 noninfectious, which is why they call for further studies to examine this hypothesis. However, they do conclude that, based on their isolation of heavy loads of active virions from respiratory samples and inability to isolate infective virions from stool, respiratory transmission is likely the primary route of viral spread.

“The combination of very high virus RNA concentrations and occasional detection of sgRNA-containing cells in stool indicate active replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Active replication is also suggested by a much higher detection rate as compared to MERS-coronavirus, for which we found stool-associated RNA in only 14.6% samples in 37 patients hospitalized in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. If virus was only passively present in stool, such as after swallowing respiratory secretions, similar detection rates as for MERS-CoV would be expected. Replication in the gastrointestinal tract is also supported by analogy with SARS- CoV, which was regularly excreted in stool, from which it could be isolated. Our failure to isolate live SARS-CoV-2 from stool may be due to the mild courses of cases, with only one case showing
intermittent diarrhea. In China, diarrhea has been seen in only 2 of 99 cases. Further studies should therefore address whether SARS-CoV-2
shed in stool is rendered non-infectious though contact with the gut environment. Our initial results suggest that measures to contain viral spread should aim at droplet-, rather than fomite-based transmission.”"

I work in social media (also in healthcare education, so zero escape for me anytime soon from this), so I've had a never-ending surge of having to read posts about this from all sides.

I'm sick of seeing people say that ""if you care about the economy/your job/your activities/etc. over the health of others, you're selfish.""

Newsflash: Every single person is selfish about this. Myself included. No one really cares about ""the greater good"" - they care about coronavirus to the extent that it affects them personally. Yeah, absolutely, we want to keep the death count low. No one is wishing death on people. But the amount that people care depends on what this personally means to them.

I was told by someone that he didn't care if every small business in our area closed and all the workers lost their jobs ""as long as my dad is okay."" Guess what? That's selfish.

I care about my mental health and livelihood more than I care about some random person and their relatives. That's also selfish. 

People with chronic illnesses want you to stay home because they personally are at risk of dying. It's not others they care about. That's selfish. 

People saying we need to stop the healthcare system from being overwhelmed? It's because they want to make sure *they* or their family members can receive treatment if needed. That's selfish. 

People screaming for others to stop running in groups? They're just worried that parks will close and that they won't be able to run outside anymore, not that the spread will increase.

People don't care about infecting strangers on the street. They care about infecting strangers on the street *because it will extend the lockdown.* Just look at the language on social media lately. At least on my feeds it's gone from ""omg we need to flatten the curve to save lives"" to ""guys, stay home or this is going to take a lot longer, and I have shit I want to do."" 

It's not ""stop hoarding toilet paper and food so others can get it."" It's ""stop hoarding toilet paper and food because I need it too."" 

*We're all selfish.* But that's the thing. We're human beings. It's a matter of self preservation to be selfish. I wouldn't expect a stranger to sacrifice everything for me.

But I'm sick and tired of reading shaming shit from people on social media, acting all holier than thou because they've locked themselves indoors for 3 weeks when the truth is, when this is over, they will care and remember how it affected them *personally*, not anyone else."

I've known it deep down for a long time but I didn't really face it and start working on it til my most recent relationship ended. He was an addict (no surprise there, given my codependency) and although we love each other a TON, we enabled each other and did not contribute to each other's ""best self.""

I've been doing a lot of work on myself over the last month and a half and I've made incredible progress. I never thought I'd be where I am now, even just a few weeks later.

Here's what I've done:

1. Meditate. I meditate at least once a day, sometimes multiple times per day if I can motivate myself to do it. It's helped me learn to sit with my feelings, good or bad. It's teaching me that I am not my thoughts and feelings, but the ""entity"" that feels them, and that means I choose how to respond to them. I can let them overtake and consume me or I can simply observe them, learn what I need to learn from them, and let them go. It's probably the single best change I've made in the last month.

2. Journal. Every day after my ""main"" meditation, I take at least 5-10 minutes to write in my journal. You can use prompts if they help but I find that once I get started, I have a LOT to write about without any prompting. I just write. I write about my feelings and thoughts and current issues. I write about the people in my life and how they impact me and how I feel about them. I write any insights I get from my meditation session. I just... write. Without worrying about how it sounds or looks or whether it's grammatically correct or even semi-lucid. I get it all out.

3. Practice gratitude. I am actively grateful for all the good things in my life. I take a little time at random moments throughout the day to sit and be grateful. I think about all the things that make me smile, all the lovely people in my life, and all the things I take for granted, and I practice gratitude for them. It can be hard at first, but it gets much easier.

4. Stay mindful. Throughout the day I make a habit of stopping to check in. Am I aware of what's going on around me? Am I present? Am I appreciating the current moment? Am I giving the people around me my full attention? Staying grounded in the present keeps me out of my head, where a lot of spiraling can happen if I'm not careful.

5. Do yoga. Yoga helps me connect with my body in a way I never have before. It keeps me ""in"" my body instead of in my head. It makes me feel strong and lean and in charge of myself. It also keeps me physically fit, which is a nice bonus. Connecting with my breath is an excellent tool for stressful moments during the day, and I use it all the time.

6. Read Codependent No More and ACTUALLY DO THE EXERCISES. I've read it before but I never did the exercises. It seemed like too much work and besides, I already knew what my problem was, right? I didn't need to actually DO anything, reading was enough. Wrong. I needed to actually do the exercises at the end of each chapter for it to help. I try to read and complete the exercises from one chapter each day.

7. Use the Self-Esteem Workbook. I've been going through this workbook for a while and it's very helpful. I always ""knew"" all of the stuff in there but didn't actually apply it. Now I'm applying it, and it makes a world of difference. Just writing down one or two sentences down can make a vast difference between reading about something and actually feeling committed to it.

8. Think about what I want. As a codependent, I spent most of my time thinking about other people, their wants and needs. Now I think about myself more often. I think about what I want, what I like, what I value, and what I need. I don't have it all figured out yet--not by a long shot--but that's okay. I'll get there. And that brings me to number 9.

9. Go easy on myself. I've always been SO hard on myself. I compare myself to others, put myself down, tell myself I'm not enough, and am just generally mean to myself, both subtly and in obvious ways. I'm done with that. I now offer myself compassion and understanding. I accept when I'm feeling down and give myself a hug (literally), commiserate, and offer to do something nice for myself--just like I would do for a loved one. I give myself a break now.

10. Actually USE the affirmations. Now I not only have affirmations and positive mantras, but I really use them. For example, I have always had body image issues. I've always hated my body and wanted to change pretty much everything about it. So the other day I got naked, stood in front of the mirror, and said my affirmations to myself. I purposely put on a lens of love and looked at myself with kindness. I gave myself compliments and smiled at myself as I said them. It was a wonderfully healing experience.

11. Talk about it. I talk to my friends and family about my codependency, my mental health issues, and my journey in recovery. I share my thoughts and feelings, I share progress, and I ask for advice when I want it. It feels wonderful to connect with people I love on a deeper level.

12. Therapy. This is self-explanatory. Therapy is the shit. Find a good therapist that you click with and you're off to the races.

There's a lot more I've done, but these are the big ones. I've also started eating healthy and cooking at home more (thanks, coronavirus!), and I'm sure that's having an impact as well.

I feel like a brand new person. But I'm not ashamed of or angry at the person I used to be. I've welcomed her with open arms, forgiven her, and absorbed her into myself. It's a whole new world, y'all :)

I'm happy to answer any questions!"

Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-diseases expert and the face of the U.S. response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, is facing growing threats to his personal safety, prompting the government to step up his security, according to people familiar with the matter.

The concerns include threats as well as unwelcome communications from fervent admirers, according to people with knowledge of deliberations inside the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice.  

Fauci, 79, is the most outspoken member of the administration in favor of sweeping public health guidelines and is among the few officials willing to correct President Trump’s misstatements. Along with Deborah Birx, the coordinator for the White House’s task force, Fauci has encouraged the president to extend the timeline for social-distancing guidelines, presenting him with grim models about the possible toll of the pandemic.  
Asked Wednesday whether he was receiving security protection, Fauci told reporters, “I would have to refer you to HHS [inspector general] on that. I wouldn’t comment.”

The president interjected, saying, “He doesn’t need security. Everybody loves him.”"

Bloomberg) --The Pentagon is seeking to provide as many as 100,000 military-style body bags for potential civilian use as the U.S. warns that deaths could soar in the coming weeks from the coronavirus pandemic.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has requested 100,000 body bags, known as Human Remains Pouches, through an interagency group that directed it to the Defense Department. The Pentagon is looking into buying more bags and will draw some initially from a stockpile of 50,000 it maintains, according to two people familiar with the request.

The move is a somber counterpoint to the Pentagon’s highly-praised deployment of two hospital ships to New York and Los Angeles to help alleviate pressure on regional hospitals overburdened by the pandemic.

The Defense Logistics Agency’s Troop Support unit manages the Pentagon’s stockpile of the green nylon, 94-inch by 38-inch body bags that are typically distributed to war zones. The unit has been in contact with the current contractor to assess its manufacturing capabilities but hasn’t yet placed a formal order, according to one of the people.

As many as 200,000 Americans are projected to die in the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, a top White House official said Tuesday, even with another 30 days of the most stringent public health restrictions in place. Reviewing the projections, President Donald Trump warned Americans of a difficult period ahead.

“This is going to be a painful two weeks,” Trump said at the White House on Tuesday. “Our strength will be tested, our endurance will be tried.”

What You Need to Know About the Coronavirus Pandemic: QuickTake

The government had not previously shared details on its projections for the spread of the virus, which has so far killed more than 4,400 people in the U.S. and infected more than 200,000.

The Defense Logistics Agency doesn’t yet have a specific delivery date request from FEMA but the agency wants them as soon as they are ready, and the Pentagon is close to agreement with its current contractor on the numbers and time lines, one of the people said.

A FEMA spokesman said the agency is making “prudent planning” for potential future needs, and that includes preparing for “mortuary contingencies” from U.S. states.

On Monday, the vice director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff outlined the general Pentagon-FEMA process that’s in place.

The Joint Staff is “in close partnership with them to identify what their needs are,” including “mission assignments” that came in Monday for prepackaged Meals Ready to Eat, and “other supplies,” Major General Jeff Taliaferro said.

The Joint Staff also received “a mission assignment from FEMA for a mortuary affairs support team for New York and we’re in the process of identifying” personnel, he added."

The reason for social distancing is not only to stop the spread (which is difficult without expansive testing) but to slow the number of people who get sick and in turn slow the number of people who need critical care.

Without social distancing, we will likely get over the coronavirus sooner but with a much higher death count. This will be due to insufficient resources to help and treat all patients."

Here's how he does it. He uses two fairly reliable facts about coronavirus:

* The death rate is about 1%
* The timeline from infection to death is about 20 days

So if we look at the total number of deaths as of today, that represents 1% of the total number of cases as of 20 days ago.

The US has had almost 5000 deaths from Covid-19 as of today. That means that there must have been 100 times as many total cases 20 days ago.

That means that on March 12, the day that Governor Wolf shut down my school, there were *already* almost **half a million** infections nationwide. The official number was only **1746**. A lot of people didn't realize, but time was already running out.

Projecting forward using various daily infection growth rates (15%, 20%, 25% daily growth in cases) we have anywhere between 4 and 17 million infected today.

Computer analysis is offering a different theory on Covid-19 kills and why chloroquine and favipiravir are so effective. Also somewhat terrifying if you think about it.

The proteins produced when COVID replicates block iron ions out of heme groups (HBB) and replaces them with one of the viral proteins. This makes the red blood cell unable to transport O2 and CO2.

This results in a devastating cascade of organ and tissue death, as if a patient were being suffocated. Even if the patient can breathe or was on a ventilator it would be of limited effect because ARDS in this case is a symptom.

So the inflammation in the lungs is the result of not being able to perform the oxygen/CO2 exchange and the organ is doubling down to attempt to make up for a deficit.

Chloroquine and faviparavir prevent the viral proteins from disrupting the process by binding to the non-structural viral proteins thus allowing the body to continue to transport O2 and CO2.

The smoking gun is that coronavirus victims tend to have elevated levels of ferritin in their blood. Ferritin is used to store excess iron, a sign that the virus is preventing the O2 AND CO2 exchange. 

If all this checks out, it is imperative that patients are given Chloroquine and faviparavir on the onset of the mildest symptoms to prevent the virus from hijacking too much of a victim's blood and to give the immune system critical time to mount a response.

Patients past critical are goners as the body may be too weak to produce enough red blood cells to offset the number hijacked by the coronavirus proteins unless.... they must be given immediate partial, or if seriously grave full blood transfusions followed by Chloroquine and faviparavir. 

If this checks out massive blood drives will be necessary.

This nicely ties in to why certain blood types are less impacted by the coronavirus as well as why patients with certain pre-existing conditions are at higher risk."

Here in Ireland for example we have an ongoing housing shortage and rental crisis with exorbitant rents. Now there are plenty reasons but one that became very obvious due to coronavirus was the harm AirBnB is doing when as soon as tourism basically died to coronavirus there were hundreds of AirBnB properties suddenly showing up property websites as long term rental properties. In Dublin for example the number of rental properties on the market increased by 64% almost overnight.

AirBnB means that people looking to buy buildings in residential areas have to compete on price with people who are going to skirt zoning laws and use that property for short term leasing. It means property prices are effectively pushed up to the same value as the property could earn as a 365 day a year short term letting property.

There are SOME reports of this having happened in China BUT getting hold of accurate information is difficult. There are a few ongoing theories regarding those Chinese reports:

a) The patient(s) initially erroneously tested COVID-19 positive when in fact they were negative and instead had some other illness but then later were infected by COVID-19 and hence tested positive

b) The patient(s) initially tested negative after an earlier positive test and then positive again. This is likely down to poor testing practices and/or that the Chinese test kits really weren't very good and so were giving erroneous results.

c) Accuracy of results also depends on not only where but WHEN the swabs were taken. There have been negative results when the infection is just firing up meaning that collecting viable samples is harder. Also, depending on the advancement of the infection, swabs taken from the back of the throat or even lower down in the airways can be more accurate (but also harder to obtain).

A quick Google search reveals even more information:

2020-04-01,SwagMastaM,bostontrees,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostontrees/comments/ftadf0/two_neta_workers_test_positive_for_covid19/fm61cpu/,"State marijuana regulators said Wednesday they are “looking into” allegations that one of the state’s biggest cannabis firms, New England Treatment Access, is failing to adequately protect its workers from the coronavirus, after employees at two of its facilities tested positive for COVID-19.

NETA, best known for its popular Brookline dispensary, confirmed that a worker at its large cultivation and processing center in Franklin and another at its Northampton dispensary were diagnosed this week with the deadly, fast-spreading disease. The Franklin facility, where the company grows various strains of cannabis and processes the plants into edibles and other products, employs more than 400 people.

The sick Franklin employee, “whom we will continue to support in every way we can, practiced excellent public health and social responsibility by self-identifying symptoms, notifying their manager upon feeling ill, pursuing COVID-19 testing, taking appropriate hygienic precautions, and self-quarantining,"" a NETA spokesman said in a statement, adding that the Northampton worker had done the same.While recreational marijuana sales have been shuttered by Governor Charlie Baker because of the coronavirus pandemic, medical marijuana operators such as NETA (which also serves the recreational market) have been allowed to continue to serve registered patients as an “essential” healthcare business.

NETA said that, per state protocols, local boards of health and the state Department of Public Health had been notified of the positive test, and insisted there was no chance the Franklin worker had contaminated products made by NETA.

The spokesman also said the company was protecting workers appropriately, including by hiring a contractor to “deep-clean” the Franklin building after learning of the sick employee, and that many employees had told management they agreed NETA’s efforts were sufficient.

However, a number of workers at the Franklin facility told the Globe that they are worried they could have been exposed to their ill coworker, including at a building-wide appreciation breakfast last week at which numerous employees were served French toast from a common table.

Workers also said the company’s social distancing guidelines are only sporadically enforced, or impractical. They described employees frequently working side-by-side and small locker rooms crowded with a dozen or more workers changing in and out of their uniforms.

The workers questioned the extent of the “deep-cleaning,” saying the facility was operated uninterrupted despite the worker’s diagnosis.
“We’ve been telling management for weeks that they have to do something about it,” said one cultivator at the Franklin building, who requested anonymity because he fears losing his job for speaking out. “We’re all piled on top of each other here. They’re more worried about money than the health of their employees and patients.""
“I don’t want to see people die because of the negligence of this company,” the cultivator added. “It’s really disheartening that I have to say that, but here I am.”

Asked whether managers had taken steps to identify workers who may have been in close contact with the sick Franklin employee, NETA initially said, “the local health department is the agency that identifies, with the [sick patient], any close contacts.” The company also reiterated that it has encouraged workers with symptoms to stay home (though COVID-19 patients may be simultaneously asymptomatic and contagious).However, the company later said managers were “in touch with the employee’s co-workers who worked closely with the employee who tested positive, and they are being asked to self-quarantine.” Another group of workers that had “close contact” with the sick Northampton dispensary employee are also self-quarantining.

A spokeswoman for the Cannabis Control Commission, which regulates both medical and recreational marijuana operators, said it is ""deeply concerned about COVID-19’s threats to patients, customers, employees, agency staff, and all residents of the Commonwealth. We are aware of the complaint and looking into it.”

The commission had urged marijuana companies to let sick employees stay home, step up sanitization efforts, switch to pre-orders only at their retail dispensaries, and strictly enforce distancing guidelines between and among employees and customers.

Barbara Carrapichano, a 30-year-old patient adviser at NETA’s Brookline dispensary, said the company has failed to provide masks or protective partitions to prevent transmission of COVID-19 between workers there and the medical marijuana patients they serve, some of whom have compromised immune systems.In addition to better protective gear, she and other workers who spoke with the Globe want NETA managers to communicate virus-related protocols better, check employees’ temperatures before they clock in, more thoroughly sanitize shared equipment such as computers, and keep workers apart, among other efforts.“We see enough people that we could be a vector for this [virus] to spread exponentially,” Carrapichano said. “NETA has not set up an adequate response whatsoever. I have an auto-immune disorder myself and I’m putting myself at risk every time I walk through those doors. My biggest concern is the people — everyone involved."""

Of the four Rumrill brothers, Riley was always the extrovert.

The 31-year-old Alabama native loved surrounding himself with people. Thursday nights were for bowling, and Sundays were for family, as he’d whip up a meal at his brother’s Cambridge home. In addition to his work as a human resources generalist for Transdev in Boston, his family said, he occasionally drove for Uber, largely because it offered a chance to meet new people.

“The best way to describe him is if you meet him one time, you’re family,” said his brother, Rob Rumrill, 34.

So it was a cruel twist that, in a room at Boston Medical Center on Sunday, Riley Rumrill died alone.

At 31 years old, Riley is believed to be the youngest Massachusetts resident to date to die from a coronavirus infection — and the first in the state under the age of 50.

He is one of 122 people in Massachusetts whose deaths have been attributed to COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. The vast majority of those who have died have been far older, typically in their 80s and above.

Riley, who suffered from asthma, arrived in Boston from Alabama in 2016 and quickly took a liking to the city. He was a regular at Wild Rover, a karaoke bar at Faneuil Hall, where he’d belt out “Sweet Home Alabama” on nights out with friends, and at Patriots games — though, like any self-respecting non-native, he maintained a healthy distaste for the team.

He had a penchant for making friends everywhere he went, and after striking up a conversation -- and friendship -- with a Colombia native one night at a bar, he found himself fascinated with the idea of visiting the country.

In late February, Riley joined his brother, Rob, and two friends for a nine-day trip through the South American country, where they took in the sites and scenery during a trip centered on Riley’s March 2 birthday.

“He’s really kind of the glue that brings everybody together,” said Steve Ciulla, who attended the Colombia trip.

The four men returned to Boston healthy in early March. But about three weeks later, in what is now known to be an ominous prelude, Riley began experiencing flu-like symptoms — fever, fatigue, difficulty breathing.

Still, having only recently celebrated his 31st birthday, Riley was young and sturdy. And even after Riley checked himself into Boston Medical Center with a high fever, Rob wasn’t overly worried.

“We played the numbers just like everybody else,” Rob said. “We knew he needed some extra attention because he had a little bit of asthma. . . . But he was a young guy, and young guys are supposed to bounce back quicker.”

Two days later, though, Riley was moved into the hospital’s intensive care unit, where he was put on a ventilator. From there, things continued to deteriorate.

On two different occasions over the next five days, doctors called Rob to alert him that his brother might not make it much longer.

Both times, Rob rushed over, only to find that the staff had managed to get Riley stabilized.

Then, early Sunday morning, the hospital called again. Riley’s ventilator had become dislodged, and the situation was dire.

Soon after, Rob and his wife were in the car on the way to the hospital when the phone rang.

Riley hadn’t made it.

Since the death, meanwhile, the family has done its mourning in that brutal, all-too-modern way. This weekend, they’ll hold a virtual memorial over Zoom; later in the year, when the pandemic’s grip has loosened, they’ll arrange for an in-person celebration of Riley’s life.

The hardest part about it all, Rob says, has been the distance.

Because of their age, it was deemed unsafe for the brothers’ parents to travel to Boston from their home in Alabama, even as Riley’s state worsened. As the situation progressed, one younger brother flew in from Atlanta, and did get to see Riley in the days before his death – though Riley was unconscious at the time.

“Nobody can see each other,” Rob said in a phone interview Wednesday night. “The only thing I want to do is hug my dad, because he’s crushed. My father lost his kid. Imagine if you lost a [family member], and they said, ‘Oh, by the way, you have to wait 90 days to grieve…’”

He paused.

“That’s the world we live in right now.”"

According to a secret report by American intelligence delivered to the White House last week, China intentionally concealed the extent of the coronavirus epidemic in its country, underestimating both the total cases and the deaths caused by the disease.  Two secret service officials told Bloomberg that the report concludes that the numbers provided by China are false.  In essence, China deliberately communicated untruthful data to the World Health Organization, irreparably compromising the response of the international community and individual states against the pandemic.

 But therefore the same, according to a study by Professor James Craska of the US Naval War College, which has also been reported in Italy, the ascertained delay in communicating to the WHO makes it possible to maximize compensation for damages by the States involved in the epidemic of the  Covid 19 against China.  This could happen before the International Court of Justice, precisely on the basis of the WHO statute, which would have been intentionally violated in several places, endangering the lives of tens of thousands of citizens in over 150 countries, not to mention the economic damages  incalculable.

 The White House staff and the Chinese embassy in Washington have not wanted to comment for the moment on Bloomberg's article citing the report of the American secret services, which should also be made available to the related secret services, and therefore also to those  Italian.

 Professor Craska's study (which was published just last week) reconstructs the news on the spread of the epidemic in China by tracing it back at least in mid-December 2019, while only on February 14, 2020 (i.e. two months after the start of the crisis  ) China has made it publicly known that 1,700 health workers have been infected.  China is one of 194 states that participate in the International Health Regulations, but has violated its art.  6 (which provides for immediate communication in the event of human epidemics) and Article 10 (which provides for immediate answers to WHO clarification questions).  Again, in late January, China rejected WHO medical assistance and answered detailed questions about the epidemic.  Hence his legal liability based on various articles of the ""Responsibility of States for wrong international actions,"" judged by the International Court of Justice, for damages assessable in trillions of dollars. As a sovereign state, however, China will do everything to escape.  It is unclear whether individual citizens and private groups can launch a class action against China.

 There was also some public relevance to the content of the American intelligence report. Yesterday, Tuesday March 31, American Secretary of State Michael Pompeo publicly urged China and other nations to be transparent about their outbreaks.  .  He has repeatedly accused China of hiding the scale of the problem and being slow to share information, especially in the weeks since the virus appeared, and of blocking offers for help from American experts. ""This dataset is important,"" he said.  Pompeo said at a press conference.  ""The development of medical therapies and public health measures to combat the virus"" so that we can save lives depends on the ability to have confidence and information about what really happened, ""he said."

Out of all the intelligence agencies in the world, US intelligence knew what was going on in China the most. And of all the CDCs in the world, US CDC knew the most - the Chinese CDC was literally modelled after and trained by US CDC. There's relationships cultivated through back-channels specifically for unofficial information sharing. Chinese doctors were sharing information with HK and Taiwanese doctors behind the scenes. You think that information never got passed up to US? I get when general population is skeptical of statistics with Chinese characteristics - that's why intelligence communities exist - it's literally their job to ""not trust and verify"" when it comes to US-China relationships. None of this is new. People on reddit can REEE all they want about Chinese statistics, but at the end of the day policy makers aren't informed by public sentiment but actual subject matter experts. 

US intelligence knew enough early on to inform US politicians' stock portfolios. But I guess not enough to inform the public. And it seems like not enough to share intelligence with allies seeing how spectacularly poorly FVEY countries have been responding - if you live in one of these countries then this more scandalous than anything TBH. But US intelligence knew, they just chose not to tell you until it becomes a convenient distraction to appease fragile people that can't deal with the fact that a techno-authoritarian government who shut down their country soon and more aggressively has better outcomes. 

Go look how many positive tests came from China in imported cases statistics from South Korea (17), Singapore (24), Taiwan (1!). Most of them right after the outbreak out of thousands of repatriated citizens. Taiwan evacuated 975 from Wuhan, 1 positive test out of 761 tests. That 1 Taiwan positive was from a flight of 247 (0.4% infection rate), Singapore had 3 positives from 263 tests over 2 flights (1% infection) . Extrapolate to Wuhan population stats (6M population assuming 5M left before quarantine)... 20K - 57K cases in Wuhan. China reported 63K. Or let's assume all 11M stayed in Wuhan, 50K - 125K cases. You can also get a sense of COVID progression in China using the same data. Almost all the positive tests came right after their aggressive lockdown. Out of the hundreds of imported cases from to these ""transparent"" countries, magnitude more come from Americas and Europe each week now than all Chinese cases. This comport with Chinese claims that most of their cases are imported as well. Full write up with [sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fspcdg/china_to_begin_counting_asymptomatic_cases/fm2zo7t/) here. 

Finally. Did China intentionally juke the stats during an uncharted crisis with a lot of unknowns and little testing capability? Sure, exactly like what's happening elsewhere. But it doesn't matter. On top of Chinese statistics not mattering, the world hasn't converged on any agreeable statistics surrounding COVID because we simply still don't know. And China isn't an outlier of the ranges that's being converged upon. The point is, every competent intelligence agencies knew what was happening in China. Even publicly, every person who cared can get a glimpse of the quarantine happening in China. People either didn't look, don't know how to look, or looked and chose to not pay attention. And in the case of intelligence / medical communities, looked but could not get the politicians to pay attention."

> The officials asked not to be identified because the report is secret, and they declined to detail its contents. But the thrust, they said, is that China’s public reporting on cases and deaths is intentionally incomplete. Two of the officials said the report concludes that China’s numbers are fake.

> “The reality is that we could have been better off if China had been more forthcoming,” Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday on CNN. “What appears evident now is that long before the world learned in December that China was dealing with this, and maybe as much as a month earlier than that, that the outbreak was real in China.

I completely disagreed with tax cuts; if you give me more money I'll save it, whereas someone from Newstart will spend it, so in the interest of consumption growth I don't agree with it. But this guy is either trying to get clicks by being controversial or is just an idiot.

His last article was ['Think when coronavirus is over Australia's economy will snap back into place?

I was expecting to read about the impact of greater indebtedness or certain industries like travel and real estate may suffer while the rest of the world is still recovering. Instead, the summary was that spending money is important, it's taken longer for previous recoveries to eventuate, and that this isn't like previous recessions. There was then some unsourced discussion about how we need trading partners to recover.  So the part of the story that the title was based on was completely unsourced.

Top companies were finally starting to get so lenient with WFH benefits, my previous employer let engineers WFH two days out of the week.

There were talks of bumping it up to 4 days a week, with just 1 day in the office for meetings.

There was an implicit understanding that as long as workers would remain as productive at home as at work, the leash would keep getting loosened. Turnover was low, output was high, high degree of trust between management and engineers. Gradually, the entire industry would have seen the benefits of WFH and shifted.

My new employer (1000+ headcount) has now had to ""trial"" remote work for the first time. All they see is production and commits literally grinding to a halt. Our two week sprints have been extended to two months. Millions in salaries paid out past couple of months, not a single feature.

Some employees are just depressed or dealing with issues in their family. Other employees are going nuts with the sudden freedom and treating it like a vacation. I can't reach any of my co-workers between 9-5 because they're at the beach or taking their dog on 2 hour walks or in the middle of a LoL match. I send a Slack message in the morning, don't get response until 5pm or next day.

Github commit graph basically went from block of deep green to one dot a week. Fresh juniors out of college even get upset that we're ""forcing"" them to do work because the sky is falling down. It's like everyone's forgotten they're still being paid a salary at home.

Sadly, companies are going to feel burned by this forced experiment. WFH should be gradually integrated into a company's culture, built on bricks of mutual benefit and goodwill. Instead, our product hasn't pushed a new feature since January and layoffs are coming."

2020-04-01,StandAloneWolf,unpopularopinion,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsdt3c/coronavirus_mega_thread/fm5abq4/,"I have two things I want to say about the virus:  


1) The stimulus package for the Covoid-19 won't be of any use to those who've been laid off due to needing to pay bills to keep utilities on, and a roof over their head. If this was the initial reason for why the package is being given to those who are no longer employed, how is a measly 1200$ (plus 500 for every child in your household) supposed to help if all of that goes to bills? What about food? I personally think that if the government is going to tell companies to shut down, and stop people from working, then they need to freeze everything, so people aren't being told: ""Hey, you owe \_\_\_\_\_$ for this, this, and this, and even though you don't have the money due to an outbreak out of your hands, we need to survive, because the people above us are asking for money we are relying on you (Our customers) to give us so we don't sink."" It's a partial fix, and due to only certain people not working/still working, it's causing financial pandemonium, and wtf was trump doing in January? Why'd he sleep on this for so long? This dude didn't even know we were short on medical supplies, and even told the press ""it was the first time he heard we were having a shortage on government testing"" even though he was informed by multiple states. 

2)  ""opinions about how the coronavirus is a good thing will be removed as it is a violation of the Reddit-wide content policy against threatening violence or physical harm.""

This isn't an opinion about how I believe it to be a good thing, but more-or-less my opinion on why removing a thread/post/comment that makes an attempt to look for a silver lining in dark times  (If done correctly) isn't a violation (Or shouldn't be). If you highlight all the positive aspects of what the virus has done in an attempt to try, and be optimistic in these dark times, it doesn't automatically mean you're down-playing, or denying that it's a terrible thing to befall everyone, just acknowledging the things that have come of it on both sides of the coin opposed to being entirely doom-and-gloom.

This is LITERALLY UNPOPULAR OPINIONS!

Even though cynical posts that refer to ""Population control"" Are exactly what this subreddit is about (AND NO, I'm NOT SAYING that's okay, just that I don't get where the line is drawn when referring to unpopular opinions, because it certainly isn't popular). I understand the virus is tearing us apart, but hey...

* Pollution levels have gone down drastically, and the effect will make an impact worldwide.
* Football (Soccer) players are playing FIFA, and the money that is given to them is donated to help in researching COVOID-19. They are hoping to raise  £50,000, and I'd say that's something worth noting!
* The canals of Italy have gotten so clear, you can actually see the bottom.
* Luis Vuitton is giving out free hand sanitizer, which also reminds me...
* People are actually washing their damn hands more!
* Housing market is looking pretty attractive with costs going down

And there's a huge list of all the bad things that are happening around the world, but with the news putting nothing good out, some people need to know that there are people working together/getting together to make an impact on fighting this virus. If this post is removed, I don't think i'll be able to post anything else in this subreddit for failing to be true to its intended purpose."

I find when dealing with Nparents, the normal affection and coddling that normal parents would do is virtually nonexistent. Take my example of an Nparent. When I turned 3 and enrolled in pre-school, my mom would force me to do math problems every single day of the summer, for hours. If I didn't do them correctly, which was often the case because she was having me do college algebra caliber word problems, I would get grounded and not be allowed to go outside while all the other kids with normal parents were outside enjoying summer. This continued until I turned 10 and finally had enough. One day, when I was getting screamed at by her, I grabbed the workbook, threw it at her face, then tore the pages out until there were 10 million scraps of paper littering my room. My mom starts swinging at me with fists and everything, hitting me across the face a couple times and giving me a black-eye after which I grabbed her hair instinctively and shoved her out the door. I knew I fucked up at that point, because she locked me in my room and forced me to ""reflect"" on what I did wrong for the rest of the day. Later that night, when my dad came home, I got screamed at by both my parents for being a ""brat child who attacked his mom."" I don't blame my dad, because my mom twisted the story to make it seem like I attacked her unprovoked, but there's a reason why now with coronavirus going on, I'm hunkering down 2000 miles away where I can enjoy my own fucking free time without being hounded to do some stupid assignment to validate my Nparent's feelings."
2020-04-01,Metruis,ExplainBothSides,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainBothSides/comments/ft5e1b/ebs_why_is_5g_so_controversial/fm5etxp/,"Yes, though obviously controversy gets stamped down in a hurry because there is a lot of money in 5G. The controversy is that there is so many nodes required to create the 5G network, exposing people to more waves of 5G, which is alleged to cause cancer and is being rushed out without adequate safety testing, because we need the tech that it will make possible. Or, at least, the powers that be desire it because there is a lot of money in the tech that it will make possible.

For example, self-driving cars, which require gigabytes of data to be bounced around every second, are simply too MUCH for the 4G network. Increasing the amount of nodes for data to travel around will make it more possible to have self-driving cars on the road.

It will be faster and people will likely make money on it.

It may have long term health impacts that have not been publicized and are quickly dismissed as conspiracy nonsense.

Thus, the controversy. Now, that has not stopped the conspiracy crowd from lumping in EVERYTHING with 5G, for example saying, ""the Coronavirus is just people getting sick from 5G (it started in Wuhan, which has 5G)"" or ""The Coronavirus is a distraction so 5G can get rolled out faster"" or ""the Coronavirus is activated by 5G waves"" and so on and so forth.

My father, who is an electrician and understands these waves better than I do, explained why it's problematic to me. The problem is just that we don't KNOW what long term exposure does. It MIGHT cause long term problems and we're not going to bother doing research because we want the associated tech now. That's the real problem, but the real problems get muddied up with all sorts of utter nonsense problems."

2020-04-01,hampatnat,canberra,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/canberra/comments/ft9ojz/act_government_to_build_a_temporary_emergency/fm5ycvz/,"A pop-up emergency department dedicated to treating coronavirus patients will be established in Woden under a partnership between the ACT government and Canberra-based health services firm Aspen Medical. 

The $23 million project will be announced on Thursday as part of the government's second economic support package to help territory households and businesses through the coronavirus crisis. 

It comes as Chief Minister Andrew Barr conceded the pandemic had all but dashed hopes that a new sports stadium or convention centre could be delivered in the next five years.

Launching the next phase of its fight against the twin health and economic crisis' sparked by coronavirus, the government has committed funding to establish a temporary emergency department to treat patients with ""moderate to severe"" cases of COVID-19.

The facility, which was expected to have approximately 50 beds, was expected to open in May. 

It was expected to be established on or next to the Canberra Hospital campus, although an exact location has yet to be chosen.

Mr Barr said the project was aimed at preventing a repeat of horror scenes in cities overseas, where health authorities have raced to set up makeshift hospitals after being overwhelmed with patients. 

""We don't want to be in the sort of situation other cities around the world are currently in,"" he said. 

""We are acting now to increase the capacity of our health services so we can continue to provide emergency care for Canberrans throughout this pandemic.""

Aspen Medical, which was on the frontline during the Ebola outbreak, has also been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19.

The company, helmed by Glenn Keys, has been helping the federal government roll out respiratory clinics across Australia. 

It was also called in to provide health checks to passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was forced to dock in Japan following a COVID-19 outbreak where more than 600 people were infected with the virus. 

Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said the company had ""world-leading"" experience in the emergency health sector.

The extra funding and support measures to be unveiled on Thursday comes on top of the ACT government's $137 million package announced on March 20.

Since then, the federal government has come forward with more economic support for Australian businesses and workers, headlined by the massive $130 billion ""JobKeeper"" program. 

Foreshadowing the release of the second phase of the ACT's plan, Mr Barr on Wednesday said the territory would aim to ""fill any gaps"" for households and businesses waiting to receive assistance.

He was again frank about the economic realities of the situation, warning that ""no one is going to come out of this ahead"".

""We are all going to lose financially,"" he said.

Mr Barr indicated the ACT would need to take on more debt to pay for the fight against coronavirus, as revenue had ""collapsed"". 

He conceded the financial hit from the pandemic would have implications for some of the government's long-planned infrastructure projects, such as a new sports stadium and convention centre. 

""A convention centre would seem a long way away at the moment, and so would a football stadium,"" he said.

""We will need some projects when we move into the economic recovery phase, but how many we will do and the size of them remains to be seen.

""It's too early to give a definitive answers, but in the context of what may be needed in the next five years, I think if you're pinning your hopes on the ACT government or the federal government being able to partner to fund convention centres or sport stadiums .... no, I wouldn't have thought so.""

Mr Barr stressed the SPIRE hospital project was ""absolutely essential"" and would be delivered, while light rail's expansion to Woden was next on the priority list. 

On Thursday, the ACT Legislative Assembly will sit for the first and only time this week, primarily so it can pass legislation to support the government's response to coronavirus.

The main item - the COVID-19 Emergency Response Bill 2020 - includes amendments to almost 20 pieces of legislation.

Opposition leader Alistair Coe said the Liberals would push for ""transparency measures to ensure that ACT government decisions throughout this period are proportionate and can be appropriately examined""."

March 4: “[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country.

But if you don’t add that to the numbers, we’re talking about very small numbers in the United States.” — Trump at a White House meeting with airline CEOs.  
  
March 7: “No, I’m not concerned at all. No, we’ve done a great job with it.” — Trump, when asked by reporters if he was concerned about the arrival of the coronavirus in the Washington, D.C., area.   
  
March 9: “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” — Trump in a tweet.

March 10: “And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.” — Trump after meeting with Republican senators.  
  
   
If we're going to blame those people who left when this was the official message from the Executive Branch, under which the CDC resides, then Trump deserves a large part of that blame."

Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said on Wednesday that anyone can make their cloth mask against the coronavirus.

On Tuesday, the ministry had already signaled that it was working on a protocol to expand the use of the equipment: before this new determination, the masks were only recommended for people with symptoms or by health professionals.

During a presentation this evening, the minister asked the ministry's technicians to disclose on Thursday the guidelines on the topic. According to him, what he previously presented as a 'protocol will be simple recommendations on types of fabric, time of use and how to wash the masks.

'Cloth masks for workers work very well as a barrier, it's not expensive to do, do it yourself, there is on the internet. Make the cloth mask and wash with bleach. Wash for 20 minutes, let it dry, have 4 or 5 of these masks for presonal use. Reuse it because now we have to fight with the weapons we have. There is no use regretting that China is not producing masks. We will have to create our weapons and those weapons will go if the ones we have', said Mandetta."

1. Most importantly, perfectly healthy people are ending up in the hospital over the virus. There’s a genetic lottery component to your body’s reaction. The rate is very low but still high enough to put immense pressure on hospitals and may leave them unable to care for other situations, like your random heart attack and car accident, which further boosts the deaths. 

2. Evidence is showing lasting lung & heart damage even in healthy individuals that catch COVID-19. We don’t know the extent because they aren’t getting a battery of tests unless they are literally dying in the moment.

3. Not everyone knows if they have a weak immune system or pre-existing condition. Obesity is a pre-existing condition for covid, so is high blood pressure, athsma, being elderly, etc. we’re talking about a lot of people still staying home in their hypothetical scenario.

4. Coronavirus lives on surfaces a long time, it will be immensely difficult to even deliver clean supplies to these people if we let it run rampant in the general population. 

5. Who decides and verifies pre-existing conditions so we know where to send resources, aid, and deliveries? How do you check the health record of everyone in Seattle in a week or two? What if they have recently moved here and their records are in another state? What if they are unable to afford preventative medicine? If we “just let the poor die”, besides being ethically horrible the hospitals will still become overwhelmed.

Keep in mind that 400,000 Americans died during WWII. About 65,000 during Vietnam. Coronavirus is already very likely to surpass Vietnam even with these measures. Had we done nothing, very optimistically, it would be four WWIIs for this country. We’d literally see mass graves.

On a final note, “common sense reasoning” is almost always wrong in the face of complex scenarios. Logistics are hard. Human behavior is weird. Experts exist because life is complex, and we should thank them for doing the hard work of telling us hard truths we don’t want to hear."

Islamic religious leaders in India invited hundreds of preachers from foreign countries for religious activities. Foreigners who came on visa belonged to a huge group that was responsible for a coronavirus cluster spread in Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan.

Foreign preachers coming from outside have to get missionary visa to preach. However, they lied to Indian authorities saying that they came on travel visa. All of them have been blacklisted today by Indian authorities.

Now the actual events: from 12th to 22nd March, national and state government passed multiple orders banning gatherings of large numbers and mandatory isolation for foreigners who came in India in last few days. They ignored all of these orders and conducted preachings on 14th and 15th March where large number of Muslims gathered in close quarters (thousands of them).

A full scale lockdown was announced after 10 days. In these 10 days, they still stay put in close proximity ignoring all orders of social distancing and ban on large gatherings. They could have dispersed in these days and practiced social distancing but they didn't do it. Why? Because leader of their group and organizer said that doctors can't do shit and if anyone has to die, there is no better place than to die in a mosque.

Obviously this blew up, hundreds found infected in their group. Both Indian Muslims and Foreign preachers ran into different states across India risking infecting many others. Some cooperated with govt, but most of them are hiding in local mosques and have switched off their phones (they even supplied wrong residence address, smh). Indian Muslims are defending them in last 48 hours by whataboutry and propaganda on social media. Not a single Muslim leader has condemned the incident in India. On the other hand, they are blaming government. When they were taken to hospitals, they spitted on cops and doctors. You can see in video what happened when doctors and cops went to search for a on-run member of the religious group hiding in Muslim ghetto with full support of local residents.

Every word in my comment is true. Search ""Nizamuddin"" in google for relevant sources. I cannot list all sources here as there are just too many of them (some sources are in other comments in this thread). In last two days, so many lies of this group has been exposed that entire country is shocked.

P.S. Leader of the group is on run and yet to be found. Indian borders are sealed so he can't leave. Somewhere in India, a Muslim ghetto might be protecting him."

Her funeral is next Wednesday and I don’t know whether I should go or not, I’m very torn. 
I definitely want to go and and need to say goodbye- it’s a natural part of the grieving process. But, it’s an hour and half drive away- I feel that if it was just down the road it would be different . I’m asthmatic and definitely don’t want to risk getting it and passing it on to my wife and son, but there will only be 5 people at the funeral and we will be social distancing. If I drive there, get out the car, go in and back home, wash my hands etc that’s surely safe as can be? Has got to be much safer than me going to the supermarket.

For starters, health experts say Trump was wrong to refer to the travel restrictions as a “travel ban,” as he did in a telephone interview on March 4 with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. During a town hall on March 5, Trump said he “closed down the borders to China and to other areas that are very badly affected.” That’s not accurate.

As Azar explained when he announced the travel restrictions on Jan. 31, the policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S.

At a House subcommittee hearing on the coronavirus on Feb. 5, Ron Klain, White House Ebola response coordinator under the Obama administration, took issue with the characterization of the travel restrictions as a travel “ban.”

“We don’t have a travel ban,” Klain said. “We have a travel Band-Aid right now. First, before it was imposed, 300,000 people came here from China in the previous month. So, the horse is out of the barn.”

“There’s no restriction on Americans going back and forth,” Klain said. “There are warnings. People should abide by those warnings. But today, 30 planes will land in Los Angeles that either originated in Beijing or came here on one-stops, 30 in San Francisco, 25 in New York City. Okay? So, unless we think that the color of the passport someone carries is a meaningful public health restriction, we have not placed a meaningful public health restriction.”"

According to the Finnish CDC, one person infected with coronavirus currently probably only infects about one new person or a bit less

A significant change has happened to coronavirus infections in Finland during the last few weeks. Without the restrictions made by the government, the R0 would have been about 2.2

R0 means how many people the average infected person will infect themselves

\- At the moment lowering amounts of coronavirus cases means that the R0 is with high probability about 1 or less. This means each case creates on average one new infection or less, Tuija Leino who is the medical director of Finnish CDC confirms to Iltalehti(newspaper name).

Leino has been involved in making previous Finnish CDC models about the coronavirus situation.

What's notable is that when Finnish CDC was estimating the R0 rates to the government on last Tuesday, even the most optimistic best case scenario had it at 1.6

&#x200B;

Other good news include the government deciding to double our testing capacity and restarting the search of infection chains. A bunch of large Finnish companies have also given funding to take 20k coronavirus tests to be done in South Korea.

Most Finns have taken the disease very seriously. The streets are mostly empty everywhere, people have moved to remote work, and online grocery delivery services have exploded in popularity."

It's not that black and white. All these restrictions are not really about keeping you as an individual healthy. They aren't even designed to necessarily reduce the total number of cases before say we have a vaccine, although they might end up doing that. The goal is to keep the number of cases at any one time within the capacity of the medical system.

So it's not ""coronavirus is going to kill us all"", it's ""coronavirus is going to kill like 3% of the people who get it if we do nothing as opposed to 0.5% of people who get it if we have enough hospital beds and ventilators"".

Definitely the authorities need to do better with enforcement of how businesses are handling the social distancing requirements. Some are doing really well, others are doing pretty poorly. But just the examples you mentioned are different scenarios. If one guy is sick and rides in a truck with another guy, he gets one person sick. If one guy is sick and huddles up with 9 other guys on a landscaping job, he might get 4-5 of them sick.

But yes, in the trades at least, one guy should drive the truck and the other guy should follow in his car. And the employer should eat the cost and reimburse the mileage."

It is not as bad as it sounds though, as soon as majority of population will have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 either through recovering from COVID-19 or receiving a potential vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 will no longer be able to cause pandemics. And it will probably prevent such severe pandemics from potential new coronaviruses as well since immunity to one such coronavirus will impair the ability of another coronavirus to cause a serious disease or spread rapidly because viruses from same family are bound to use similar cell entry mechanism to a certain extent (both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 for example) and have at least some identical proteins, which will be recognized by our immune system.

**Q: do you think we should be wearing a mask? Not a medical mask, ... even a cloth mask**

A: if you look back, this whole story of masks has been confounded and conflated with things that I think has been created a little bit of confusion. the issue is that if everybody wears a mask and you don't have enough masks the health care workers who need them may not get it. but that has driven the conversation i think to an extreme. because it says well, you know masks are not that effective in preventing you from infecting somebody else or infecting somebody else uh uh uh affecting somebody else in their ability to infect you. it's not perfect. but I think this is one of those time where we need to re-look at it. Because although it isn't 100% protective IF you have enough masks, that you don't take away from the people who really need them, ie. the health care workers, I think we should seriously consider the pros and the cons of maybe modifying our stance on whether people should be wearing masks because something doesn't have to be 100% effective to be beneficial. 

**Q: will you recommend it?**

A: You know, from what I've seen, Sanjay, I think that if we do not have the problem of taking away masks from the health care workers who need them, I would lean towards it. Because I mean, what harm can it do if you have enough masks? 

**Q: the optics of masks ... how much of that concerns you? Does it make us look like a nation that is sick?**

A: you know, that was part of the conversation. If everybody wears a mask does that look like we're all frightened by each other. But you know, the people in Asia, have been doing that long before coronavirus and it's become part of their culture. I mean, is it good, is it bad? I think it's neither good nor bad, they've just integrated that into their culture. uh and as I said I cannot imagine it's doing harm and it might be doing some good."

The 2,400 employees at MicroStrategy Inc. make and sell analytics software from the publicly traded company’s offices in Tysons Corner, Virginia, Toronto and elsewhere. On Monday, everyone received a three-page memo from the chief executive, Michael Saylor, urging the staff to “run toward the crisis, not away from it.” The message compared the global spread of the new coronavirus to the flu, an analogy that has been repeatedly contradicted by health experts.

Even in the middle of a national emergency that has prompted authorities across the U.S. to try to prevent gatherings larger than 10 people, MicroStrategy told its employees to be at their desks. “If we wish to maintain our productivity, we need to continue working in these offices,” Saylor wrote. “It is soul-stealing and debilitating to embrace the notion of social distancing and economic hibernation.” (MicroStrategy did not respond to requests for comment. After being contacted by Bloomberg News, Saylor sent a message to employees saying his initial memo was “off-the-mark” and encouraging remote work.)"

The proper measure of how well a disease is controlled is the absolute number of new cases per day.  

It's easiest to start with an actual, albeit extreme, example as an illustration: Right now, the [Vatican City has the highest per capita infection rate of any country on Earth](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) 7,491 infections per million.  But they only have *six* actual cases.  In fact, if the Vatican City was testing every single one of its residents every single day, if they caught their patient zero on day one and quarantined him, and never had a single other case (i.e. if their response was essentially perfect), they would *still* have more cases per million than America (1,249 v. 14).  And if that patient zero happened to die (which would be unsurprising in a city of old priests), then Vatican City would have the highest per capita mortality rate of any country on Earth.

As I said, that's an extreme example, but it highlights a couple of the failings of using per capita numbers as an evaluation:

(1) **Per Capita Ignores the Reality of How New Viruses Spread:** 

In OP's article, the author suggests that using absolute numbers to evaluate an epidemic response is like using absolute numbers to evaluate how well a state is controlling drunk driving - ""It’s like calling California the drunk driving capital of the country without mentioning that this is only because it has more people than any other state.""  

The difference is that drunk driving cases aren't caused by each other.  In other words, we don't start with one drunk driver who causes two new drunk drivers, who in turn cause four more.  Each case of drunk driving is caused independently by the decisions of the driver - you don't need to be ""infected"" by another drunk driver to drive drunk yourself.  And because each case is caused independently, it's not surprising that, ceteris paribus, a state that has twice the population of another should have twice the number of cases.  The same should hold for murders, illiteracy, thefts, and many other social ailments.  

But that's not how a virus works when introduced into a new population.  With the exception of the patient zero, each case of the virus is caused by earlier cases.  The higher the **absolute** number of cases, the faster the virus grows.  If both India and Ireland start with one patient zero and the R0 is the same in both countries then, ceteris paribus, both will have the same number of cases 60 days in despite their very different populations.  

You might think that bigger countries are likely to have more patient zeros, or higher population density, or more resources, or something else that would make the virus grow faster or slower.  But there are many examples that show those assumptions are false.  Hong Kong, with a small population but close ties to mainland China, likely had many more patient zeros than Brazil, which has a much larger population.  Wyoming has a larger population than Vatican City, but has much less population density.  

In other words, to the extent factors are modifying the number of patient zeros, or the R0 of a virus within a country, it's those factors, and not the population size, that matters.  

(2) **Exponential Growth Eliminates Much of the Significance of Population Size:**  

Obviously population size does matter at a certain point because it acts as an absolute cap on the number of people there are available to infect.  And before you get to that point, new infections become less frequent because of a scarcity of uninfected individuals.  But by the time you've reached that point, the virus is completely out of control anyways.  

It's easy to see how this works if you do the math. Assume both the US (population 330,000,000) and Italy (population 60,000,000) have 100,000 cases of coronavirus. Assume further that the R0 in both countries is 2.0 - i.e. that each infected person infects 2 others.  

* On generation 2 you have 200,000 cases
* On generation 3 you have 400,000 cases
* On generation 4  you have 800,000 cases
* On generation 5 you have 1,600,000 cases
* On generation 6 have 3,200,000 cases
* On generation 7 have 6,400,000 cases
* On generation 8 have 12,800,000 cases
* On generation 9 have 25,600,000 cases
* On generation 10 you have 51,200,000 cases

**Italy's population exceeded.**

* On generation 11 you have 102,400,000 cases
* On generation 12 you have 204,800,000 cases

**US population exceeded**

* On generation 13 you have 409,600,000 cases

Obviously this is a simplified calculation, but the point it illustrates is that Italy's population and America's only two generations of growth apart when you're talking something that grows as an exponential rate like a virus.  

In other words, by the time a population's size comes into play the virus is so widespread that the government has no control over it anyways.  And no country on Earth is anywhere close to that point."

Each country had a headstart of one month, and due to different measures taken, the results are also different. 

So, what did they do differently?

>Apart from China, South Korea was one of the worst-hit countries in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. But an aggressive response has made it one of the exemplars in the midst of the pandemic — thanks to its swift implementation of a mass-scale testing regime as well as its consistent, transparent messaging to the public throughout the arc of the crisis. On both counts in the initial months of the outbreak, the Trump administration fared poorly.

...

>“Because South Korea has had these types of outbreaks already occur, they know the kind of steps that need to be taken and how serious the danger is,” Leighanne Yuh, an academic at Korea University, told the Financial Times. “If we compare it to the United States, which hasn’t really been exposed to these things, at least for a long time, their response has been quite different.”

They went into ""oh shit!"" mode *real* quick; while we stayed in ""don't panic!"" mode for far too long.

We most assuredly can give *some* blame to the Chinese government, and to the WHO, for saying not to panic. 

At the very least, they gave those who would be inclined to say ""don't panic!"" (like Trump) cover and justification.

Does that not raise any red flags to you, like at all?

Furthermore, your own link says; ***""But coronavirus is not spreading in El Paso County faster than in other areas.

THOSE VIRUSES ESTABLISH LATENT CELL-BASED RESERVOIRS TO PERMIT CHRONIC INFECTION. Vaccines aren't going to be useful for viruses that establish reservoirs in latent states that can effectively hide from immune surveillance. That's something that's particularly obvious because THOSE ARE BOTH CHRONIC INFECTIONS. OF COURSE YOU CAN'T DEVELOP A VACCINE AGAINST THAT.

Secondary transmission is from droplets landing on surface and then being transferred on hands. Tell the landlord that they should be careful not to touch anything. Then sanitize all of the surfaces that people are likely to touch like doorknobs, light switches, counters, cabinets.

Also, the virus on surfaces degrades over time. Ideally, you would stay away for some time afterwrds but that is hard with everywhere closed. You might ask that landlord pay for hotel room for night but not sure if hotel room would be cleaner."

>There’s still a good case for masks, though, even if they can’t stop viruses from getting in: They can stop viruses from getting out. “I’ve been slightly dismissive of masks, but I was looking at them in the wrong way,” Harvard’s Bill Hanage told me. “You’re not wearing them to stop yourself getting infected, but to stop someone else getting infected.” This might be especially important for SARS-CoV-2, which can spread without immediately causing symptoms. If people are infectious before they fall sick, then everyone should wear face masks “when going out in public, in one additional societal effort to slow the spread of the virus down,” says Thomas Inglesby of the John Hopkins Center for Health Security."

**Coronavirus: a new clinical study on the efficacy of chloroquine launched in France**

The CHU of Angers launches from Wednesday a new clinical study to measure the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19. 33 French hospitals are associated with this trial. 1,300 patients, in a non-worrying state, are part of the system.

After the major European test launched last week, including in France, France is launching a new clinical trial on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19. This derivative of chloroquine, a molecule present in drugs against malaria, is already used at the IHU in Marseille by Professor Didier Raoult, who claims that it treats the coronavirus.

**33 hospitals mobilized in France**

This clinical trial, ""Hycovid"", as it was baptized, will be carried out on 1,300 patients, in 33 hospitals in France. According to Ouest-France, they are mainly in the west (Cholet, Lorient, Brest, Quimper, Poitiers) but also in the north (Tourcoing, Amiens) in the southwest (Toulouse, Agen), and in the Paris region. Colmar will also participate in the study. The Angers University Hospital is the establishment which is piloting this test.

**A very strict protocol**

The patients concerned are sick with COVID-19 and the molecule will be administered to patients who are neither in a worrying state nor in intensive care, but who present a high risk of unfavorable evolution. ""We will treat people early, which is probably a determining factor in the success of treatment,"" said Professor Vincent Dubée, principal instigator of the project at the University Hospital of Angers.

Most of these patients are elderly (over 75 years) or have respiratory problems with need for oxygen, but without distress respiratory. Patients can receive treatment at the hospital, in nursing homes, or at home. 

Professor Vincent Dubée promises a rigorous essay:

This is a study that meets the highest scientific and methodological standards. It will be carried out under conditions which will not leave room for doubt in the analysis of the results. Not all patients will receive the drug, since there will be a placebo. Without the patient or the doctor knowing it.

**First results within 15 days**

The challenge of these strict rules is to ""close the debate"" on the efficacy of chloroquine, underlines Professor Dubée. Thanks to this protocol, he affirms that there will be ""no doubt"" in the analysis of the results.

We await the first results within 15 days and the conclusions at the end of the month, but Professor Alain Mercat, president of the medical commission for establishing the CHU d'Angers says that we will not waste time: If the effect of the drug is very large, the response is likely to be very rapid. Very quickly, there will be so many lives saved or patients not intubated that we will be able to see it and stop the study. If the effect is less significant, it will take a little longer."

When we first started discussing COVID-19, the focus was on CFR because, of course, we all wanted to know how deadly the thing was. With that result in mind, people aged 0-30 were seemingly unaffected. If you look at the current data, the CFR is still very, very low for that age range, around 0.1-0.2%. This is the same across most countries, including the US.

However, the new focus is on hospitalizations and ICU visits because countries want to determine the resources they will have to assemble at their peak. Age impacts hospitalization rates less, though milder cases do tend to congregate at lower age ranges. 

The problem is that the narrative was formed by using one set of data (CFR) and now it's being challenged with a different set of data (hospitalizations). This is illogical and leads to a lot of confusion and fear, even suggesting that the virus is somehow more potent. Young people can still get very sick, but the numbers don't back up a media narrative that young people are all dying from this suddenly.

Keeping the virus in when anyone can be asymptomatic means asymptomatic people should wear mask too you fucking twat. How are you so obtuse?

It's not even true that it doesn't keep it out at all! There's a low but non-zero protection. But even if it was zero, keeping the virus in still makes a proven massive difference at the population level.

Conservative friends and family I know simply trust different sources of information. I don't mean *news*, I just mean different authorities.

""I'll believe it when I see it."" These folks are most concerned with threats that they can observe with their own eyes. Until a pandemic hits a home state and people start dying around them, red states and their population will resistant to change. 

Video or visual confirmation is a big deal. That's why 9/11 was such a more powerful rallying cry to conservatives - a lot of liberals I know where shocked, but they were the ones to say ""its only 3000 people."" It's ironic that things are flipped in this way for coronavirus. I think it because there isn't a big televised event, and most of the threats of the pathogen are abstract figures that show exponential growth curves.

""What the fuck does that guy know."" The folks are also skeptical of experts. Not any experts, but a specific group of experts. ""University educated, PhD holding, non-contributing, brainiacs that know nothing about the real world.""
If you haven't met someone who talks like this, you haven't traveled around the U.S. very much. They have the same skepticism about academics as the left has about religious figures. 

To this group, data science and epidemiology is about as reliable as divining tea leaves. I've really wracked by brain trying to figure this out. It long predates the culture war and ""librul colleges"". Maybe it is, but it feels like an intractable problem. I don't know.

Today's big thing seems to be about testing and how not everybody is being tested.  Just to keep people up to date, as of LAST WEEK, the Victorian Government instructed testing sites to test every fifth person presenting as a way to track how the virus is spreading through the regions.  

Source: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-27/coronavirus-testing-stepped-up-in-regional-victoria/12095632

The Department of Human Services website criteria for being tested doesn't seem to reflect this - probably because there's Federal standards and then state based instructions on top of that.

This is probably why we're picking up on community spread and why the numbers have ticked up.  However, it's also promising that the numbers of community spread aren't jumping up by the hundreds.

Further information: CMO of Victoria spoke today regarding community spread and visiting your significant other, and it was reported in the ABC live blog: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-02/coronavirus-live-blog-updates-covid-19-australia/12112584

Regarding testing in Victoria:

> There will be more out there that haven't been detected'

> Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton is speaking now.
 
> He says there will be more community transmissions out there ""that haven't been detected"".
  
> ""As we expand the testing capacity, as well as expand the testing criteria that's been agreed nationally, we will have greater opportunities to find community transmission.
  
> ""Finding is a good thing. So having an increase in numbers we can detect means we can isolate the individuals and we can have their close contacts in quarantine. ""
 

And as additional confusion about partners visiting each other if they don't live together:

> Questioned on some of the confusion around visiting partners and relatives, he says he hopes the message is ""abundantly clear"".
 
> ""The core message here is if you can stay at home, you must stay at home.
  
> I understand that people are looking for particular outs for exceptions that relate to their individual circumstances. But it's really definitive advice."""

It's almost impossible for people to know if they are infected or not right now. In the absence of widespread testing, masks seem to be a good measure in reducing spread of the disease. In order for it to be effective though, everyone needs to wear them.

Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, mentions this in his roadmap to reopening the US.

This is a religious mob pelting stones on health officials who went there to screen these locals.

This screening is being done because there has emerged a cluster in india which is threatening the entire nation after some average rise in corona virus positive cases in last few days.

Recent surge in cases is due to an international religious conference which happened in delhi 2 weeks ago.

Many ppl who attended that conference have tested positive for coronavirus. Indians of a particular community who were infected there went back to their respective states and might have infected others too. 

Most new cases coming up in india are related to this conference.

This conference was illegal and it had many religious scholars who came from 15+ different countries to preach their religion.

**So in order to keep track of potential cases, health officials are visiting localities of people who attended this religious conference. Here in this locality, the mob attacked health officials, who are there to only helped them.**"

Here’s u/quasargyle’s comment highlighting some of his comments early on thru March. I’ll let you do the fact checking because I’ve already done it.

January 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

February 2: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

February 25: “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

February 28: “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right?  Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa.” “They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.”

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

Edit: March 9: ""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant.”

March 10: ""It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.""

 As of March 19, the country has conducted more than 307,000 tests, the highest per capita in the world. The UK has conducted 64,600; The US even less that. “You have countries like the US right now, where there's a fairly strict criteria of who can be tested,” says Kee Park, a lecturer on global health at Harvard Medical School. “I know people personally who have symptoms that are highly suspicious, but they don't meet all the criteria and so they're not being tested.”

“[South Korea’s] extensive testing is a very valuable tool to both control the virus and understand and measure the effectiveness of the responses that are taking place,” says Michael Mina, assistant professor at the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard University. “It’s allowed individuals to take matters into their own hands and make social distancing decisions on their own, both to protect those around them and to protect themselves from those who are infected around them.”

A **key part of this testing is to find and isolate asymptomatic carriers, before they spread the infection unwittingly.**Though Korea’s death rate, at 0.6 per cent, is likely lower because the outbreak has been restricted to young members of the population, a new study suggests that five in every 10 cases are undetectable.

**REDACTED**

Can we please stop posting random medical advice claiming to cure/prevent Coronavirus on Facebook? That would be great.

Your random assortment of MLM essential oils and superfoods will do absolutely nothing (besides possibly smelling nice?) and it's incredibly irresponsible to mislead desperate, fearful people into thinking it will help. You do not know more than the professionals working to find treatment for Coronavirus and neither does any post you find on Facebook. Wash your hands, stay inside, don't put your hands in your mouth, and research before you post.

>  
>Meanwhile, the uber-wealthy have taken to their yachts and private jets. Music and film titan David Geffen, who is worth $7.7 billion according to Forbes, exemplifies how the rich literally sail away from their problems. Geffen, on his now-deleted Instagram account, wrote, “Isolated in the Grenadines avoiding the virus. I’m hoping everybody is staying safe.”  
>  
>Geffen’s tone-deaf message highlights the disconnect between the ultra wealthy and the majority of Americans. Rich people are able to leave their homes in Manhattan and flee to their summer houses in the Hamptons or to their get-away homes in non-congested rural parts of Connecticut.  
>  
>The private jet market is doing a brisk business whisking the elite out of New York and other major cities. Jerod Davis, the owner of private charter jet company, said in an interview with Slate, “There are only 1,800 private jet operators, to my knowledge, in the United States. So believe it or not, sometimes you actually run out of private jets over the holidays. And that’s kind of what’s going on right now: There’s so much demand that they’re actually running out.” Meanwhile, the average American is told to stay indoors under self-quarantine.  
>  
>The rich and powerful seem to get preferential treatment. Republic Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida was immediately tested for the coronavirus after being exposed to a person who may have been a carrier of COVID-19. After one NBA basketball player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19, 58 tests were quickly given to 58 other members of the team and organization.  
>  
>NBA athletes, actors, politicians and the wealthy have better healthcare plans and can afford high out-of-pocket costs. Billionaire Kenneth Langone, cofounder of the Home Depot chain, has connections for his own healthcare needs. Langone has a hospital named after him (NYU Langone Health) and is able to freely contact top medical and science professionals.  
>  
>Gwyneth Paltrow, starred in the virus-outbreak movie Contagion. While on a jet, Paltrow posted a selfie on Instagram showing her face mask (at the time, regular people were advised that masks were not necessary). She wrote, “En route to Paris. Paranoid? Prudent? Panicked? Placid? Pandemic? Propaganda? Paltrow’s just going to go ahead and sleep with this thing on the plane.” She advised her Instagram followers, “Stay safe. Don’t shake hands. Wash hands frequently,” reminding them, “I’ve already been in this movie.”  
>  
>The rich are also hunkering down in their bunkers. These are not your average basements of doomsday preppers. These bunkers are state of the art, fully equipped with special air-filtration systems and fortified to withstand any violence due to a breakdown in society. A year’s worth of food and supplies can be stored in bunkers that are as large as some homes and are sold for prices in the millions of dollars.  
>  
>Regular rich people have been fleeing to states deemed safer than the ones they live in. The exodus has been so great that the Centers for Disease Control issued a travel advisory urging residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from “non-essential domestic travel” for 14 days—amid reports that the Tri-state residents are fleeing the coronavirus-ravaged region.  
>  
>On “Meet the Press,” Dr. Deborah Birx, a specialist in dangerous diseases and the key member of President Donald Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, complained about this migration saying, “We immediately saw cases rising out on Long Island and cases rising in southern Florida. What we’re trying to say to everyone is when this virus comes to your metro area, please stay in your metro area where your care can be provided because it’s spreading virus more quickly around the United States.” Florida and Texas state governors issued travel advisories, set up checkpoints and initiated screening of drivers coming from coronavirus hotspots. Other state officials are also establishing policies and systems to stop the flow of people coming into their states and spreading the virus.  
>  
>Senator Bernie Sanders stated, “Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. We’ve got people who are struggling working two or three jobs to put food on the table. What is going to happen to them?” While the rich make their getaways, the less affluent are forced to deal with finding childcare, food and jobs."

""Evolving Epidemiology and Impact of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions on the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China""

According to this preprint, Rt in Wuhan shrunk to around 0.3 by **February 2**.  What really changed around that date?

>  On February 2, **with improvement in medical resources**, the government implemented the policy of centralized quarantine and treatment of all confirmed and suspected cases, those with fever or respiratory symptoms, as well as
close contacts of confirmed cases in designated hospitals or facilities. Meanwhile,
temperature monitoring and stay-at-home policies were implemented to all residents
in the city

It was the **improvement in medical resources**, which I interpret to be sending in additional health care workers **and** wartime mobilization to increase PPE, including being able to clothe everyone in protection suits, not just gowns, that enabled the ramped up measures after February 2.

>  Our results also
indicated that healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates

> For example, we are learning that hospitals might be the main Covid-19 carriers, as they are rapidly populated by infected patients, facilitating transmission to uninfected patients. Patients are transported by our regional system, which also contributes to spreading the disease as its ambulances and personnel rapidly become vectors. Health workers are asymptomatic carriers or sick without surveillance; some might die, including young people, which increases the stress of those on the front line.

One has to ask whether mathematical convenience and not science is dictating this fascination with models that find tractable relatively uniform populations versus trying to understand the real life complexity of **non-uniform** populations with a specific part, health care workers, the significant factor."

That applies to family too. FFS people that don’t practice social distancing are part of why the virus is spreading so quickly.

Many lawmakers and advocates for the poor say filing a tax return shouldn’t be necessary for people on Social Security because the government already knows how to send this population monthly checks. The [$2.2 trillion aid legislation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/senate-stimulus-bill-coronavirus-2-trillion-list-what-is-in-it/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3), passed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, said that if someone has not filed a 2019 or 2018 tax return, the U.S. Treasury should get their information from Social Security, if applicable.

But, the Internal Revenue Service posted a[ notice ](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)on its website on Monday instructing Social Security recipients who do not normally send in a return to file a “simple” tax return, which will be available soon.

“People who typically do not file a tax return will need to file a simple tax return to receive an economic impact payment,"" the IRS said. “Low-income taxpayers, senior citizens, Social Security recipients, some veterans and individuals with disabilities who are otherwise not required to file a tax return will not owe tax.”

A request to IRS and the Treasury Department for comment about the discrepancy was not returned. Democrats and some Republicans are upset that the Trump administration isn’t doing more to help ensure that as many Americans as possible get these payments during this national health emergency.

Thirty-four Democratic senators sent the White House a [letter](https://www.hassan.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Hassan%20Brown%20-%20Soc%20Sec%20Direct%20Assistance%20Payments.pdf) Wednesday asking why the Trump administration is placing this “significant burden” on senior citizens and the disabled. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri called it “ridiculous.""

 Most high school seniors and college students won’t get any money. The bill gives nothing to families for their children older than 16, a shock to many households already reeling from canceled graduations, and college students readjusting to life at home with so many universities shut down. Many immigrant families are also learning that they are ineligible. In order for anyone in the family to receive a payment, each person in the household — including children — is supposed to have a valid Social Security number."

This is the issue with the messaging from the White House early on in the pandemic. People operate on incomplete information all the time, and so what the President says is very important, because it gets media attention and carries with it a ton of weight in peoples' minds. When the President downplays it, that communicates to most people that its not a real threat. 

On top of that, the first major action taken in the US was the NBA suspending the season. That didn't happen until March 11th.

The average person is not following the news that closely. The average person is not necessarily aware that any cruise ship could be dangerous and they aren't aware that the coronavirus is any more deadly than the flu. And the reason for this is because the messaging from the White House pretty deliberately created that confusion by denying the problem.

Couple that with a general problem in the US where the media builds a lot of hype around every minuscule problem, and the fact that corporations have aggressively worked to develop distrust of expert opinions, its easy to miss.

Sure, people can hold personal responsibility for this, but its really foolish to ignore the institutional problems that have led to individuals not having the information they need and the critical thinking skills necessary to make good decisions."

I don't know what budget airlines will still be operating by the time it's safe to travel...but most airlines have the option to save money with whatever they call their super-economy tickets now.  
  
- The amount of money you'll need is up to you. For 6 months, flying between places, visas, activities...$8500 would be better to have. It's very easily possible to travel most of those countries with that budget, but you'll have few luxuries. There are a couple expensive things worth paying for (Angkor Wat, a high-quality Ha Long Bay cruise, guided tours at places that interest you, ethical trekking tours with local guides, ethical elephant sanctuaries, etc.). Plus, there's no harm in having money leftover at the end - but don't spend everyday and wave it off with ""Well yeah, I have $1000 extra beyond my budget"".  
  
- If we're being cautious...I would recommend $9000-10,000, and leave $1,500-2,500 in a bailout fund. However, either budget is possible. But as you've seen with travelers stuck due to the pandemic, etc., plan to have the financial means to get out of any bad situations in a hurry. 
  
- Laos and Cambodia are must visits, in my opinion. With 6 months, go where you want, take it slow. I'd look at some places you really would like to go, and fill in the blanks once you arrive. 6 months split between potentially 9-ish countries is pretty generous, but you'll have to decide how to budget time.   
  
- I'm not qualified to answer about coronavirus and travel. I wouldn't book anything soon, and if you book further out, be prepared to change your plans. There's no obvious end in sight. No idea about prices either. Management and strategy consulting firms are probably champing at the bit to figure out post-COVID pricing."

Even the mention of such ideologies surrounding measles, polio, smallpox or other zoonotic viruses our definitely noteworthy. 

It is important to note however that the wild game from the civet cat (actually a pangolin - cat seems to be a bit of a misnomer) is where the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic originated. The Novel coronavirus (COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCov) did emerge out of China. MERS-CoV while the more recent of Coronaviruses to emerge out of the Saudi Arabia-Jeddah discovery, was one of 4 to not emerge out of China. 

There has been some research already pointing to deforestation, and intrusion into the natural habitats of bats and civets that may have exposed the human population within the Chinese provinces impacted by 2 of the 4 coronaviruses. 

[Forbes: Linking Deforestation to Emerging Coronavirus Potentiality](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2020/03/21/how-deforestation-is-driving-the-emergence-of-novel-coronaviruses/amp/) 

I must state that I take a different stance with two of your claims:            

1) “Viruses can come from anywhere.” - Epidemiological research studies will prove to be the best identifiers for origins of diseases. Technically more common viruses can emerge and thrive in multiple environments, however pandemic-inducing viruses require additional information before making any allusions that they can emerge from just anywhere, such as characteristics (eg. Helical shape vs Envelop shape, 20 nm to 14000 nm size, and varying Replication Cycles). I would be careful before grouping a Coronavirus with just any virus. The etymology behind viruses is far more important than many know.

2. “[...]if this didn’t come from China, something like it would have come from one of the dozens of other countries[...]” Again while there is truth, in the fact that many countries engage in the practice of hunting/capturing and eating wild game this is not an exact parallel and you are dangerously close to espousing several logical fallacies in this claim (as well as the above) to direct, at minimum, an emotional attack and, at maximum, an erroneous correlation. These broad statements do not assist in anyway more than blaming a country would.

With that said, China must be held accountable for not being more transparent with the Global Human population, let alone it’s own citizens. While blaming China brings nothing more then perpetuated heat from the growing flames of hate and borders on fear-mongering, discussions on global level must be held to begin making adjustments to how our critical responses are handled in both present and past pandemics compared to approaching future pandemics.

Regardless, stay safe, decry the ignorant and improve the critical awareness & thinking in others by sharing thoughts positively, wisely and calmly.  Thanks."

Although fever, cough and difficulty breathing are the typical hallmarks of infection with the new coronavirus, some patients exhibit altered mental status, or encephalopathy, a catchall term for brain disease or dysfunction that can have many underlying causes, as well as other serious conditions. These neurological syndromes join other unusual symptoms, such as diminished sense of smell and taste as well as heart ailments.

In early March, a 74-year-old man came to the emergency room in Boca Raton, Fla., with a cough and a fever, but an X-ray ruled out pneumonia and he was sent home. The next day, when his fever spiked, family members brought him back. He was short of breath, and could not tell doctors his name or explain what was wrong — he had lost the ability to speak.

The patient, who had chronic lung disease and Parkinson’s, was flailing his arms and legs in jerky movements, and appeared to be having a seizure. Doctors suspected he had Covid-19, and were eventually proven right when he was finally tested.

On Tuesday, doctors in Detroit reported another disturbing case involving a female airline worker in her late 50s with Covid-19. She was confused, and complained of a headache; she could tell the physicians her name but little else, and became less responsive over time. Brain scans showed abnormal swelling and inflammation in several regions, with smaller areas where some cells had died.

Physicians diagnosed a dangerous condition called acute necrotizing encephalopathy, a rare complication of influenza and other viral infections.

“The pattern of involvement, and the way that it rapidly progressed over days, is consistent with viral inflammation of the brain,” Dr. Elissa Fory, a neurologist with Henry Ford Health System, said through an email. “This may indicate the virus can invade the brain directly in rare circumstances.” The patient is in critical condition.

These domestic reports follow similar observations by doctors in Italy and other parts of the world, of Covid-19 patients having strokes, seizures, encephalitis-like symptoms and blood clots, as well as tingling or numbness in the extremities, called acroparesthesia. In some cases, patients were delirious even before developing fever or respiratory illness, according to Dr. Alessandro Padovani, whose hospital at University of Brescia in Italy opened a separate NeuroCovid unit to care for patients with neurological conditions.

The patients who come in with encephalopathy are confused and lethargic and may appear dazed, exhibiting strange behavior or staring off into space. They may be having seizures that require immediate medical care, and experts are warning health care providers who treat such patients to recognize that they may have Covid-19 and to take precautions to protect themselves from infection.
Much is still unknown about the neurological symptoms, but efforts are underway to study the phenomena, said Dr. Sherry H-Y. Chou, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who is leading a team of investigators for the Neurocritical Care Society.

“We absolutely need to have an information finding mission, otherwise we’re flying blind,” Dr. Chou said. “There’s no ventilator for the brain. If the lungs are broken we can put the patient on a ventilator and hope for recovery. We don’t have that luxury with the brain.”

Experts have emphasized that most Covid-19 patients appear to be normal neurologically.

“Most people are showing up awake and alert, and neurologically appear to be normal,” said Dr. Robert Stevens, a neurologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore who is tracking neurological observations.

In one recent paper, Chinese scientists noted that there was some evidence that other coronaviruses were not confined to the respiratory tract and invaded the central nervous system, and the authors speculated that this may potentially play a role in acute respiratory failure in Covid-19.

Dr. Stevens emphasized that all mechanistic explanations at this point are hypotheses because so little is known: “It could be as simple as low levels of oxygen in the bloodstream,” resulting from respiratory failure, along with an increase in carbon dioxide, which “can have significant impact on the function of the brain, and lead to states of confusion and lethargy,” he said.

How Coronavirus Hijacks Your Cells
The intricate journey of the virus that causes Covid-19.
Neurologists in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak started, were among the first to report the symptoms in a preliminary paper published online in February.

Since that report, specialists observed similar symptoms in Germany, France, Austria, Italy and Holland as well as the United States, including among patients under 60, Dr. Stevens said.

Some doctors have reported cases of patients who were brought in for treatment because of their altered mental state, and who ultimately tested positive for Covid-19, although they had none of the classic symptoms like fever or cough.

Four elderly patients who came into Danbury Hospital in Connecticut with encephalopathy ultimately tested positive for Covid-19, although they had no other symptoms, said Dr. Paul Nee, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital. Two of the four went on to develop low grade fevers and needed oxygen briefly, but two did not, he said.

While it is not unusual for elderly people to experience confusion when they develop other infections, “the striking thing is we have not seen any real respiratory illness in these patients,” Dr. Nee said. They have continued to test positive and cannot be discharged, even though they are not really ill, he said.

But earlier reports had indicated that severely ill individuals with more typical symptoms were more likely to exhibit the rare neurological conditions, which ranged from dizziness and headaches to impaired consciousness, stroke and musculoskeletal injury. The Chinese study in February said that about 15 percent of those patients with severe illness experienced a change in mental status, compared with 2.4 percent of those who did not have severe illness, according to that study.

Another study, published in the British Medical Journal in late March, found that of 113 patients from Wuhan who died of Covid-19, 22 percent had experienced disorders of consciousness, ranging from somnolence to deep coma, compared with only 1 percent of another group of patients who recovered from the illness.
For potential Covid-19 patients and the people caring for them, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes “new confusion or inability to rouse” among the warning signs that should prompt a decision to seek immediate medical care.

Patients who have encephalopathy and seem confused or incoherent are prone to having seizures, and should receive treatment as soon as possible, said Dr. Jennifer Frontera, a neurologist at N.Y.U. Langone Health who is working with Dr. Chou. She added that seizures can manifest in more subtle ways than the dramatic presentations often depicted in movies and television shows.

“Seizures are not always big things where people fall down and are shaking on the ground,” Dr. Frontera said. “Some could be just veering off, not paying attention, making repetitive non-purposeful movements, or just mental status changes where people are just not themselves.”

But even if seizures are not observed, people who are sick should be aware of other potential mental symptoms.

“You don’t feel your best when you have a fever, but you should be able to interact normally,” Dr. Frontera said. “You should be able to answer questions and converse in a normal fashion.”

On average, every person infected with the Coronavirus infects 2 to 2,5 other people (natural rate, without any lockdown, social distancing, etc).   
For measles, this number can be as high as 18. The mortality of measles is lower (about 0.2%) but it would spread so much faster that it wouldn't be unlikely that close to all people on earth would get infected within a year."

>European countries intended for more than $1 billion cash for medical supplies to go to the Iranian people, who have been ravaged by the virus.

This includes hoarding medical supplies that were meant to aid Iranian citizens.

Also, medical supplies and aid are not sanctioned: ""The United States exempts medicine and medical devices for the Iranian people from US sanctions,"" says Brian Hook, the American special representative for Iran.

So Bernie wants to lift all sanctions? We have sanctions on their financial institutions (that filter funds to terrorist groups) , aircraft and aircraft parts, arms and ammunition, companies doing business with Iran and on all Iranian-origin imports. Temporarily easing the restrictions might be reasonable,  but the last thing the people of Iran need is more stuff going to their leaders violent pet projects abroad or into their own pockets."

You may find the following information useful.

The new NCP coronavirus may not show signs of infection for many days. How can one know if he/she is infected?

Certainly, being sick to your stomach, having a fever and/or cough are all indications that you may have a flu. However, the coronavirus can attack your lungs causing fibrosis making it difficult to breath. Fibrosis can manifest prior to the other common symptoms. It’s been noted that by the time some patients check themselves into a hospital because of being sick to their stomachs, fever and cough, they often have fibrosis affecting more than 50% of their lung capacity.

Experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning:

Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stuffiness or tightness, etc, it proves there is no fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicating no infection. Common sense dictates that you should self-check in an environment with clean air (e.g. – no smoking or other pollution).

Another good recommendation is that everyone should ensure their mouth and throat are moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. Drinking water or other liquids will WASH any virus in your mouth down through your esophagus and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach ACID will kill all the virus."

Everything from the initial sentence (CHANGE MY VIEW. IF YOU CAN'T DO IT THEN YOU LOSE LMAO) to the cherry-picked comments, none of which are any of the points that are being pushed at the faculty meeting today, to the final sentence which implies such an evil motivation on the side of opt-iners, scream that you've already made your mind. Looking the comments section, it appears you're also going after supporters of opt-in, trying to box them into your strawman defense game.

But, for the sake of completion, and to be a little bit constructive, let's address your points. Ultimately it can be summed up as follows. **We are really voting between opt-in and mandatory S/U (there's no way Universal pass succeeds). Your arguments' logical conclusion is furloughing S/U all together in favor of Universal pass. This argument can and should be made independently, but the arguments for opt-in S/U are more nuanced and address a whole other aspect you're missing.** Specifics follow:

1) This is always a challenge. Mandated S/U would still have this problem, as we would be differentiating between an S and U. Nothing fundamentally changes with Mandatory S/U. 

2) See above, as S grades would only be reflective of this privilege stuff under the same logic. Your problem is about the cutoff/gradation, not about the intrinsic notion of separation. If anyone gets a U (note that a D, which is a passing grade for most non-major requirements, is actually easier to get than an S), then they would still fall prey to grades ""no longer accurately reflect competence and/or relative abilities"".

3) Yes I do accept this possibility. We can address this directly by ""flattening the grade curve"". There's no need for mandatory S/U. However, this logic can also be applied to the debate between mandatory S/U and Universal Pass. Wouldn't it be a lot easier now for people to take advantage of other struggling students to pass classes they wouldn't have passed? I mean struggling students (and I mean like catches Covid-19 struggling) are going to be at a greater risk of getting U grades, thus artificially inflating the curve for students who aren't struggling but would've gotten U grades originally.

&#x200B;

To summarize the above, your points aren't invalid but they push for Universal Pass instead, which isn't an option right now. A push for Mandatory S/U in fact keeps the inequality you've so thoughtfully outlined above. 

The final two points are not related at all. In fact one is inane and the other is downright disrespectful.

&#x200B;

4) Yes I accept this. Really I do. If this is such a bad argument, then we should get rid of this provision altogether. Then can we have opt-in S/U? If yes then great. If not then you're just attacking one provision, which doesn't translate to an attack on the overall stance.

5) What gives you the right to decide what other people feel? Really. How entitled do you have to be to think that grades don't matter when it comes to school? Honestly this is just shockingly blind and entitled. Not everyone can be here just for the ""learning and growing experience"". You don't know what these students are feeling, since maybe they need their grades for, I don't know, scholarships, job opportunities, and yes graduate school. Maybe they need grades to maintain a driving goal for professors to teach so, I don't know, they can advance themselves academically and feel better prepared for future classes since it may be difficult to self-teach. And don't give me any of that ""Oh but the professors will still care due to their reviews"". Professors with tenure oftentimes don't have to care, even without a crisis, as shown by the repeated failure of some classes to be engaging. With a crisis we should be cutting them some slack anyways. Ultimately, I don't know. And you don't either. But it's not only presumptuous but also arrogant to think others, especially a whole group of students pushing for choice, might not need a reason for grades. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now please, respond with your ""emotional arguments such as how one might possibly think it is fair to gain an advantage over their affected peers"" in a bid to paint anyone who disagrees with you as a heartless monster who only wishes to exploit this catastrophe for personal gain. But before then, how about you hear an actual argument for opt-in S/U first. 

&#x200B;

The measure pressed forward today, overwhelmingly is focused on targeting students who want this choice and want to make a choice which isn't S/U. You'll say that not passing negatively affects students like you who want a Mandatory S/U for reasons you've listed above and maybe some others. I'm open to these, really. I understand where you're coming from. But ultimately such a measure would forcibly control the choices which students should have the sole power to make. It would usurp a fundamental student right, something which I'm not sure we should be doing.

&#x200B;

Anyways, as an aside it is interesting to note how many colleges which implement universal S/U allow students to petition for grades. Perhaps we should consider this.

>BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. — Brevard County is under a burn ban and Brevard County Fire Rescue Chief Mark Schollmeyer says people need to follow the rules, especially during this coronavirus pandemic.


>They have already seen an increase in fires, like a 10-acre fire that happened Saturday in the Grant-Valkaria region.


>""We were informed that it was caused by a gender reveal using Tannerite and a weapon,"" Schollmeyer said. “Something as seemingly innocent as a gender reveal, can turn into a large-scale disaster where homes are threatened,” he added.


>Schollmeyer said incidents like that can strain their resources.


>""Especially during all these potential COVID responses and medical responses it can quickly overwhelm resources and by that I mean, it will leave no resources to respond to those medical calls when needed,"" Schollmeyer said.


>What steps can you take?


>""We want to prevent those wildfires started carelessly by let's say fireworks, camp fires open trash and burning, bonfires, those kind of incidents can escalate rapidly. The outdoor equipment utilizing internal combustion engines like ATV’s, lawnmowers and the like, make sure they have a spark arrestor on them,” Schollmeyer said.

I filed my PA UC claim on March 16th/17th. I received an email from the office saying there are delays, because of the number of claims being filed. I never received a pin, but I finally got a hold of the office today (4/01). The administrated said, “ my claim was never filed.” Although I had a confirmation email saying my claim was submitted. Basically, she clarified that the unemployment office didn’t approve the filing, because no one checked it. That being said, they didn’t mail my PIN number. Luckily, the lady got me sorted and fixed me up!

Overall, there’s a surge of unemployment claims being filed and there isn’t enough people in the administration to meet the demand. I recommend calling in the morning when the office first opens. I had to call about 40 times before I got the answering service and then I opted to have them call me back.

* Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
* Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

Comparing a terrorist attack to the current situation doesn't make much sense to me. People are less likely to fly if they think there's a chance that they could die, but once coronavirus is ""under control"", what's stopping people from flying again?

The only thing I can think of is that people who used to fly for business might be slightly more comfortable using video conferencing and will consequently take fewer flights (but given how awful most video conferencing is, it may not have this effect at all)."

He said Google was helping.  
>  
>That [wasn’t true](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trump-misrepresents-google-coronavirus-website/). But in the following days, Oscar Health—a health-insurance company closely connected to Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner—developed a government website with the features the president had described.  
>  
>The site would not have helped many Americans even if it had launched. Today, more than two weeks after the president promised a national network of drive-through test sites, [only a handful of such sites have opened](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-promised-scores-of-big-box-retailers-would-offer-parking-lots-for-covid-19-testing-there-are-only-five-of-them/2020/03/27/ece8ab06-703a-11ea-aa80-c2470c6b2034_story.html), and [fewer than 1 million Americans](https://covidtracking.com/) have been tested.

This was the main issue I had with Donald's original Google claim: a website that directs people to the nearest coronavirus testing site is utterly useless if there are no testing sites. There was all this hubbub about whether or not he was lying about a website, but that was just a distraction from the really serious problem.

**Best-case scenario:** Donald was actually telling the truth about Google (or one of it's sister companies) developing a Covid-19 website. Ultimately, it doesn't matter, though, because such a website is pointless without actual testing sites.

**Worst-case scenario:** Donald was lying about the Google website, *and* such a site is pointless without actual testing sites.

This was putting the cart before the horse on a national scale.

By the way, this represents a worrisome and frustrating trend that's been going on ever since Donald took office: his worst-case and best-case scenarios are often both crap.

Is Donald aware that he's a Russian agent, or is he just a useful idiot who, for whatever reason, keeps pushing Russian interests?

Did Donald intentionally commit impeachable crimes by withholding hundreds of millions of dollars of war assistance from the Ukraine, or is he just a transaction-obsessed ignoramus who didn't know what he was doing was an impeachable abuse of power?

Is Donald really a racist, or does he ""just"" push dangerously racist rhetoric because he knows it excites his base?

Is Donald showing signs of dementia, or is he just a mush-mouthed moron who can't seem to remember things that happened like a day or two before?

It's all crap with this guy."

With roughly 13% rate of positive cases, that indicates to me that our test processing capacity is roughly 750 per day. I'd be curious to see how many tests have actually been taken...

ETA: 
I did a back of the envelope calculation. 750 tests processed a day. Someone in another thread said that the wait time for positive tests can be as long as 2 weeks. Let's say the wait time is 2 weeks (overestimate), 13% positive rate (underestimate). 

That's 750 tests a day x 14 days x 13% positive ~ 13.6 thousand positives. 

That's about .27% of the population of Alabama infected so far. And that's assuming no false negatives, which from what I'm reading is a bad assumption.

ETA 2: 
A good way to check these numbers would be to look at how many people are hospitalized with Covid-19... and then find a reputable statistic on what fraction of people with coronavirus get hospitalized. I have access to hospitalization numbers for EAMC but not for any other hospital. This is, of course, going to be a little messy given the number of people uninsured in Alabama: people are less willing to go to the hospital if they don't have insurance. Although I suppose that's true of getting tested too... sorry, this is turning into a short essay!"

**Jan 23** - Wuhan officially locked down. [Emergency hospital construction](http://en.people.cn/n3/2020/0124/c90000-9651671.html) begins.


Thoughts on this: 

* Local Wuhan government tried to downplay the initial outbreak and hid it from the public. Why? Save face? Trying not to incite panic/fear? pOLiTicS? No one knows.  

* I am 100% sure there's more than 82k infected in China. I am also just as sure that the number is nowhere near as high as some here have continuously speculated. China has made it known that they're not including asymptomatic people who have tested positive in the official count. I don't know why it's not included, but in the US asymptomatic people aren't even being tested at all, so the numbers coming out of the US are also ""low"". 

* I'm sure the numbers in China are not as high as some have speculated because no other country instituted a lockdown on the level that China did. They did not weld people's doors shut (can we just debunk this myth for good). They sealed all exits/entrances except for 1 so they can control flow of people going in and out. There are machines scanning temperature everywhere. Only one person per household is allowed to leave and get essntials. Call it draconian yes. It is however, very effective. 

* I think the time from Jan 4 to Jan 8 when world leaders were waiting for information from China was far too long. 

* In hindsight, they COULD have shut down Wuhan after Jan 19, when confirmed cases were first reported in other metropolitan cities; especially after Jan 20 when H2H transmission was confirmed."

I don’t need fresh food like dairy or eggs or fresh produce but I have enough frozen meat, frozen produce, pasta and rice to last me way over six months. Whereas food delivery is a waste of time because it’s probably only good for one or two meals.  I’m a small person and don’t eat a lot as I’m barely 100 pounds so but I spent a few hundred dollars on groceries they can last me a few months and this way I can minimize my contact with delivery people. So obviously having one interaction with someone every three for five months is lower risk than getting food delivery which you probably need to do at least every other day. Also the reason why I have so much food is because I am a prepper.  

With coronavirus it makes sense to minimize your contact with other people so obviously with a little bit of groceries I can make 70 meals or as one delivery order will only last me two days maximum.Also. Like I said I am not buying fresh produce or dairy so I’m not one of those needy people that need to go to the grocery store every week or every two weeks or every three weeks. I have a shit load of pasta and rice and also frozen meat and at this point I can live off one grocery delivery run for probably four months. I weigh less than the average American so I don’t eat one serving of each as that would be too much food for me and I also measured everything I eat on a scale so I know exactly how many grams of pasta or rice I am eating by the way which is another reason why my food lasts long. 

On top of that also has a shit load of dried foods, canned food etc. etc.

Personally, restaurant delivery is NOT worth it to me at all and I probably won't be having it for the next year. Why risk infection for one meal that will last MAX two days, when I can risk infection for groceries that i can live off for the next FEW MONTHS? I am very good at stretching and rationing groceries and not like these dumbasses that go to the store every week so trust.... i make that shit LAST. 

These are equivalent to war time. I don't need luxuries like Postmates etc.... where people back in World War 2 in to food delivery when bombs where flying and the risk of death imminent? No, they use what was in their pantry and made that shit last for years as they hid in their homes. Same thing I'm doing.

It's too much of a pain the ass to disinfect plastic bags, plastic containers etc from food delivery for a postmate order that's only good for a few meals, whereas for groceries i only have to do that shit once and it will last me months."

A critical number that is so hard to pin down: Are Massachusetts hospitals on track to being overwhelmed by coronavirus patients? - The Boston Globe
 
7-8 minutes

DPH gives daily updates on coronavirus tests performed, and the number of infections and deaths from the disease. The state releases daily numbers about the total number of infected patients who have ever been hospitalized during their illness, but that number is cumulative, a spokesperson has said, and does not reflect hospitalizations on a given day.

This number is critical, experts say, as the country and state try to avert what happened in Italy, where a shortage of hospital beds and specialized equipment, such as ventilators, forced doctors to make life-and-death decisions about who deserved the highest level of care. The central goal behind the social distancing directives has been to slow the rate of spread so that hospitals have enough capacity to care for those who are seriously ill at any one time.

On Wednesday, state officials reported 682 cumulative hospitalizations, likely an undercount, because another 4,716 cases are deemed “under investigation.” That means the state received the coronavirus test results from a private, clinical, or commercial lab, and still needs to follow up with the patient, a family member, and the clinician who ordered the test to find out if the person has been hospitalized, according to DPH.

If that figure of 682 were assumed to be the number of people hospitalized, Massachusetts would have a 9 percent hospitalization rate among its infected population, a remarkably low number compared to data from other states. Many states exhibit roughly a 20 percent hospitalization rate, data shows, and this number is another key metric of the intensity of the pandemic as well as whether it’s trending up or down.

State officials said they track hospital capacity and the state’s overall patient census, including those hospitalized for cancer, heart disease, or other conditions, but hospitals do not report their daily number of coronavirus inpatients.

The Globe has attempted to compile a list of total current hospitalizations due to the virus but has had inconsistent success. Most of the state’s largest hospitals, such as Mass. General, Brigham and Women’s, and UMass Memorial Medical Center, have readily provided information about how many coronavirus patients have been admitted, with the exception of Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, which has refused repeatedly. “It is what it is,” said Baystate spokeswoman Shelly Hazlett when asked for reasons for the denial.

The latest figures obtained by the Globe show that the state’s big hospitals are not yet near capacity, but patient beds are filling up, particularly for those requiring intensive care. For instance, as of Wednesday, Mass. General was treating 245 patients for confirmed or possible coronavirus infections, including 55 in the ICU. Brigham and Women’s Hospital on Wednesday had 87 admitted patients with confirmed or suspected cases, including 19 in its ICU.

Holyoke Medical Center, the Western Massachusetts hospital in the city staggered by a COVID-19 outbreak at a soldiers’ home, said Monday that it had 6 confirmed cases at the hospital and 19 suspected cases.

The figures can be harder to come by at some community hospitals, which represent about 60 percent of the state’s 61 acute care hospitals.

Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, for example, declined to provide such information to the Globe despite multiple requests, including after news that two residents of an assisted living facility in a nearby town had been hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms.

Steward Health Care, which operates nine hospitals in Massachusetts, including Good Samaritan in Brockton and St. Elizabeth's in Boston, announced on March 17 that it was turning one floor of Carney Hospital in Dorchester into a special COVID-19 unit. But after touting what it claimed was ""the nation's first"" coronavirus treatment unit, Steward refused to release information about how many such patients it was treating or testing, instead directing questions to the Executive Office of Health and Human Services.

Some hospitals have claimed they’d like to disclose hospitalization numbers but were told by the state Department of Public Health to keep quiet about coronavirus admission numbers. However, a spokesman for the state has denied any such edict has been issued.

On Tuesday, a Department of Public Health spokesperson said in a statement that the state asks hospitals on a regular basis “about their available ventilators and available beds as well as if they can convert any other spaces in the facility to adult ICU or adult medical surgical beds. We are also asking that they report current inpatient census overall.”

The state Executive Office of Health and Human Services said in a statement that, “A core function of the COVID-19 Response Command Center is working with hospitals to identify their capacity and resources in order to prepare the Commonwealth for a surge in COVID-19 medical needs and hospitalizations.

“This surge capacity planning involves daily communications with hospitals, health systems, and other health care facilities to identify capacity, monitor trends in hospitalization, and plan for medical surge alongside public health and infectious disease efforts. Additionally, the Commonwealth has engaged its emergency management and logistics resources including the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, the National Guard, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to identify and prepare additional facilities for future surge.”

Calculating available beds for the surge of coronavirus patients is challenging. State data shows that Massachusetts’ 61 acute care hospitals have about 14,000 beds, though not all are designed to be used for very sick patients infected by the virus and that number doesn’t take into account current efforts to expand capacity to handle the surge of COVID-19 patients.

Also, a large number of existing beds are already taken up by other patients sickened by other conditions unrelated to the pandemic.

New forecasts from the University of Washington predict that the demand on Massachusetts hospitals will peak around April 14, and that by summer the virus will have taken nearly 1,800 lives in the state.

Governor Charlie Baker on Monday said the epidemic is likely to begin peaking in Massachusetts between April 7 and 17. In preparation, he said, the state has moved to add 1,000 nursing home beds, recruit retired clinicians to help, cancel elective surgeries, and asked the federal government to send 1,000 ventilators, the Globe has reported.

Lizbeth Kowalczyk, Priyanka Dayal McCluskey, Evan Allen, and Felice Freyer of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

State marijuana regulators said Wednesday they are “looking into” allegations that one of the state’s biggest cannabis firms, New England Treatment Access, is failing to adequately protect its workers from the coronavirus, after employees at two of its facilities tested positive for COVID-19.
NETA, best known for its popular Brookline dispensary, confirmed that a worker at its large cultivation and processing center in Franklin and another at its Northampton dispensary were diagnosed this week with the deadly, fast-spreading disease. The Franklin facility, where the company grows various strains of cannabis and processes the plants into edibles and other products, employs more than 400 people.

The sick Franklin employee, “whom we will continue to support in every way we can, practiced excellent public health and social responsibility by self-identifying symptoms, notifying their manager upon feeling ill, pursuing COVID-19 testing, taking appropriate hygienic precautions, and self-quarantining,"" a NETA spokesman said in a statement, adding that the Northampton worker had done the same.
While recreational marijuana sales have been shuttered by Governor Charlie Baker because of the coronavirus pandemic, medical marijuana operators such as NETA (which also serves the recreational market) have been allowed to continue to serve registered patients as an “essential” healthcare business.
NETA said that, per state protocols, local boards of health and the state Department of Public Health had been notified of the positive test, and insisted there was no chance the Franklin worker had contaminated products made by NETA.
The spokesman also said the company was protecting workers appropriately, including by hiring a contractor to “deep-clean” the Franklin building after learning of the sick employee, and that many employees had told management they agreed NETA’s efforts were sufficient.
However, a number of workers at the Franklin facility told the Globe that they are worried they could have been exposed to their ill coworker, including at a building-wide appreciation breakfast last week at which numerous employees were served French toast from a common table.

Workers also said the company’s social distancing guidelines are only sporadically enforced, or impractical. They described employees frequently working side-by-side and small locker rooms crowded with a dozen or more workers changing in and out of their uniforms.
The workers questioned the extent of the “deep-cleaning,” saying the facility was operated uninterrupted despite the worker’s diagnosis.
“We’ve been telling management for weeks that they have to do something about it,” said one cultivator at the Franklin building, who requested anonymity because he fears losing his job for speaking out. “We’re all piled on top of each other here. They’re more worried about money than the health of their employees and patients.""
“I don’t want to see people die because of the negligence of this company,” the cultivator added. “It’s really disheartening that I have to say that, but here I am.”
Asked whether managers had taken steps to identify workers who may have been in close contact with the sick Franklin employee, NETA initially said, “the local health department is the agency that identifies, with the [sick patient], any close contacts.” The company also reiterated that it has encouraged workers with symptoms to stay home (though COVID-19 patients may be simultaneously asymptomatic and contagious).
However, the company later said managers were “in touch with the employee’s co-workers who worked closely with the employee who tested positive, and they are being asked to self-quarantine.” Another group of workers that had “close contact” with the sick Northampton dispensary employee are also self-quarantining.

A spokeswoman for the Cannabis Control Commission, which regulates both medical and recreational marijuana operators, said it is ""deeply concerned about COVID-19’s threats to patients, customers, employees, agency staff, and all residents of the Commonwealth. We are aware of the complaint and looking into it.”
The commission had urged marijuana companies to let sick employees stay home, step up sanitization efforts, switch to pre-orders only at their retail dispensaries, and strictly enforce distancing guidelines between and among employees and customers.
Barbara Carrapichano, a 30-year-old patient adviser at NETA’s Brookline dispensary, said the company has failed to provide masks or protective partitions to prevent transmission of COVID-19 between workers there and the medical marijuana patients they serve, some of whom have compromised immune systems.
In addition to better protective gear, she and other workers who spoke with the Globe want NETA managers to communicate virus-related protocols better, check employees’ temperatures before they clock in, more thoroughly sanitize shared equipment such as computers, and keep workers apart, among other efforts.
“We see enough people that we could be a vector for this [virus] to spread exponentially,” Carrapichano said. “NETA has not set up an adequate response whatsoever. I have an auto-immune disorder myself and I’m putting myself at risk every time I walk through those doors. My biggest concern is the people — everyone involved."""
