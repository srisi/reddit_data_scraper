Unless, of course, you have a bunker somewhere out of town stocked up already.

Bugging in gives you access to a lot more supplies than you could fit in a car/truck - plus then you're traveling and being exposed to people.

Now of course, I believe the chance the need for that is very low in the USA. Not one to spread doom and gloom. I am very hopeful all will be good. But on the flip side, for the first time ever, I am prepping because that is not a regret I want to have, especially with family.

You can't guess if/when shit will hit the fan. It could be tomorrow, next week, next month, never. No one knows. Odds that it will is probably VERY, VERY low. However, my mindset is to be prepared ASAP so that if shit hit the fan tomorrow, I can go home and know we'll be fine contained inside for a long time. Each day that passes with new information, I am feeling better about my decisions that I am making now that are very much out of my character."

I dont think there has been enough time to tell in the USA. I was getting hopeful when hearing of no new cases but one just popped up 10 min ago. I think that there is some funny stuff going on with the markets. I also see the SO2 levels spiking in Wuhan which indicates that they are burning large amounts of biomass. I’m not panicked but I’m definitely on high alert. The CDC has also not been very fast at all at detecting it and I am seeing that they are making it easier to test. I really believe we are in the calm before the storm here. Wether I am right or wrong the next 2 weeks will be critical.

There nurses from many different hospitals who went to school together and are friends or were in the same sorority. I’m always amazed at how connected a lot of the nurses in our city are. So rumors and things tend to spread fast, especially between the university hospitals and the children’s hospitals.

Hate to even say this, but even the flu hasn’t been terrible here this year, at least in the pediatric world.

This conclusion follows directly from facts that she was reporting as uncontroversially true, yet she was so focused on following the talking points and not causing panic she didn’t think twice. I don’t even think (from reading Amy Harmons NYT article from this morning) that what she was saying was even true (that the only people who will be tested are those who have direct links to China). I get that, right now, most people who have respiratory symptoms will be very unlikely to have novel coronavirus, since even if it is in the community it is early in the local spread of the epidemic.

2020-02-05,MGoDuPage,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezdvsx/stop_a_us_coronavirus_outbreak_before_it_starts/fgnfi1j/,"Even without expanding screenings to any patient with ""unexplained pneumonia"", there's a good chance the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US will skyrocket over the next 7-10 days for at least two reasons:  


1. FDA expedited approval for the coronavirus testing assay to about 100 approved facilities across the US.  This means the daily capacity & also turn-around times (due to not having to mail all samples to CDC headquarters in Atlanta) is about to increase significantly starting early next week.  Source:   [https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-coronavirus-outbreak-cdc-sending-test-kits-to-over-a-hundred-labs-20200205-fnwz646sozdd3m3rsxbp6uejcu-story.html](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-coronavirus-outbreak-cdc-sending-test-kits-to-over-a-hundred-labs-20200205-fnwz646sozdd3m3rsxbp6uejcu-story.html)
2. CDC screening criterion for getting formally tested for coronavirus 2019 (Patients Under Investigation, or ""PUI"") has expanded as of February 2nd.  Previously, the geographical criteria was *""History of travel from* ***Hubei Province*** *within 14 days of symptom onset.""* Now, that has expanded to, ""History of travel from **mainland China** within 14 days of symptom onset.""  Source:   [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html#criteria-evaluation-pui](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html#criteria-evaluation-pui)

&#x200B;

Bottom line is, there is a good chance we will see major increases in confirmed case numbers due to a massive increase in both testing capacity and in the number of actual samples being submitted for testing.   Therefore, even if in the next 10 days there isn't a single new case of coronavirus ACTUALLY contracted within the United States (unlikely, but best case scenario), the overall numbers will likely go up simply because they'll be doing a better job of detecting/confirming the cases that already exist.  As other countries expand their capacity to conduct screening tests with these assays, I suspect a similar dynamic will happen with those countries too.  


So unless we all get insanely lucky, it's a matter of WHEN (not  if) the numbers of confirmed cases  in several other countries including the US will skyrocket.  The key at that point will be to figure out--is the spike in confirmed cases mostly just countries doing a better job of identifying previously existing cases, or is it largely a function of the cases becoming truly self-sustaining epidemics locally?  Unfortunately, only time will tell.  Once the major confirmation spikes happen, if the growth largely flatlines, then we can assume the spikes were mostly due to just ""onboarding"" prior existing cases.  But if after another 7-10 days the spike continues to grow at a fairly rapid clip, then it suggests that local containment of the virus may be failing."

Your post is... Not scientific. You can't adjust the pH of your body with food. Maybe your urine but that's it.  Your pH is important and your body will change your breathing rate to maintain the proper pH.

With breathing rate in mind, if you really want to raise your body pH you have two easy options. First is hyperventilate. The second is buy a ticket to La Paz and bring on the altitude sickness.

An alkaline pH is miserable. It's so important to maintain the correct pH that you will actually stop breathing in an attempt to retain CO2. Central sleep apnea. In the daytime. You will be going through your day and catch yourself forgetting to breathe. Fortunately [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetazolamide) little pill generally fixes it all. How does it work?

There is not enough testing going on so there are cases that are out there that aren’t looked at. The idea right now isn’t containment but should be around beefing up testing to local doctors offices and urgent cares and hospitals. On the bright side the epidemiologist for Johns Hopkins says she is confident that it is not severe. So lots will get infected but severity is minimal.

Sustained high fever
Nausea subsides
Sustained respiratory distress
Pneumonia (leading to hypoxia)

She then proceeded to say that there was no need to be tested unless you had been to China or been in close personal contact with someone who had been. So the only way we would ever start testing people in the community is... when somebody comes into the ER and drops dead of viral pneumonia 10 days from now. At which point we will know it is circulating in the community. I hope the public health people are not so brain dead but I’m not super optimistic. The WHO press conference didn’t give much confidence that public health officials are taking this sufficiently seriously. Why would continued trade/travel links be any kind of priority at this point in the epidemic?

Our rivals were another team in a neighboring town. When we played, it was blood. Both teams were there to win. If the team couldn't win, then they were there to make them hurt. It was brutal. It was competitive.


But then one of the kids on the other team was diagnosed with cancer. He couldn't play. We heard about it, but still looked forward to our game. This kid played guard I think, so it was going to be hard for them to make their plays. 

Before the game, we visited him at his house. Our team and his team. He couldn't come out to join us, but he saw us from inside. I remember the smile he had. 

We played that night. We won, since they were down a starter. But there was no blood or bad sportsmanship. I remember everyone smiled. We had fun. We all missed him.

He rejoined the team the following year. We played again. That spirit remained. It was a damn fun game. I think we won again. It might have been a tournament, because I remember THEY were cheering for us for a later couple games. I think the loss was felt by us. We knew we were made to play eachother, and it wasn't right with him out.


I hope that can be the US and China. Grow strong together. We aren't trying to steal each-others secrets, but just find ways to work together in the midst and enjoying our mutually competitive spirits."

Even if the death rate is 0%, but the hospitalization rate is 20% do you realize what a disaster that will be in ANY country? Even a hospitalization rate of 2% would be disastrous. Health care systems do not have extra capacity just sitting around waiting for a pandemic. The beds do not exist. The specialized equipment does not exist. The trained medical staff does not exist. The support workers and supplies do not exist. If these severe cases are not able to get medical care, they will become fatalities or perhaps only suffer permanent lung and secondary damage.

Someone who is infected sneezes or exhales and sheds virus into the air by the droplets in the air they are expelling. The size of the virus containing particles varies based upon the method of expulsion from the human body.  Even just sitting and breathing a human being expels moisture, thus the potential of live virus. obviously a cough or a sneeze will expel the virus with more velocity for a larger area. The individual will be expelling most likely larger particles, the problem is the smaller particles which are much easier to just to suspend in air for a longer period of time.  I guess the easiest example is fog and mist versus rain. The problem lies in the fact that the pleated surgical masks do not form a tight seal and it's more likely that the smaller particles could reach mucous membranes. I still think it's better than nothing but if one could get an n95 mask they are better off making that choice."

The Chinese government lies all the time lol. They lie about human rights violations, they lie about SARS, and they lie about Wuhan Virus. In fact, if Whinny the Pooh’s mouth is moving, it’s probably a lie. 

But there’s BEEN suspicion that they’re cremating the dead as fast as they can. Many Chinese are quite traditional, as far as I know, and many are superstitious about the dead and how they should be treated. So, it’s a huge deal to be incinerating the dead like this. In my mind anyway, it’s more to do with having a quick way to handle the issue caused by the virus. To me, it says that people are dying in such great numbers that they can’t be counted or accounted for. Just be rid of the bodies. It’s faster to cremate and takes less space to do so. 

I don’t know where the post is, but someone posted yesterday or the day before about satellite imagery that shows a chemical tell suggesting massive cremation operations going on. Something about a chemical that biomass gives off when it’s burned. 

I think it’s more accurate to say that while the Chinese are lying about their numbers, they genuinely don’t know how many are infected and they don’t know how many are dead due to the virus. I think the panic there is justified. The Chinese people are going through it for sure, and I personally feel really bad for them. It’s terrible. At the same time, I hope the rest of the world doesn’t experience the same fate. 

But I’m not worried for now. I know the potential is there for this thing to be a worldwide plague that can cause apocalypse-like issues, but right now we can still control it. We can quarantine those infected and exposed. But it can still get out. It can still cause problems like what China’s dealing with. I hope not."

The reason the numbers are as low as they are is because they’re only screening people based on the criteria that they either visited China recently or came in contact with someone with CV. 

Plus they’re still allowing flights from China in certain parts of the US, not to mention the people from neighboring countries like Korea, Japan, etc. 

Obviously you can’t screen/contain everyone but the efforts to prevent seem extremely limited right now. 
The total confirmed number only being 11 makes me suspicious as well.  

I wonder what they’re doing about the vast numbers unable to seek treatment, mild symptoms, and H2H spread. 

This is what worries me. And it worries me because it could be too late before they make an official statement regarding severity level.

If it doubles 2x or 3x, I may decide what to do with finances and family in other places. 

Waiting until it's in your workplace is way too late in my opinion. Chances are if you have it in a hospital/center near you, start making a list of items."
2020-02-05,Alexjosie,Coronavirus,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ezf151/whats_everyones_risk_appetite/fgmu2ei/,Agreed! I sat down with a younger colleague today and made him do math on the average percentage increase (publicly released not speculation) of cases over the next 14 days. That’s without taking anything else into consideration. I’m pretty sure he’ll be googling it all tonight now!

The problem is that a negative isn't nationwide interest. You'd probably have to try the local media of each place.

For example there were four being watced in Detroit/tested and the only media I saw was saying that one was negative and the three others had already been negative. I'm like ""already? where was that? It was never even announced."""

This shows mass burning of something. Could be cremations, could be burning infected medical supplies. I really don’t know but I know the Chinese gov is lying.

[possible real numbers ](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3871594) 

This is worse than they say, opening new hospitals and repurposing buildings for the infected and a lockdown of 50-80 million. That doesn’t add up for only 24,000 infected."
