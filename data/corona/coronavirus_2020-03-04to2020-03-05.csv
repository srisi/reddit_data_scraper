Almost no one is licking their fingers and touching a food sample, then NOT eating it. Even if they did, that sample would probably get tossed.

It's only those with cardiovascular issues or those above 60 that are hit hard by it. This is one of the reasons it's going to be so hard to stop the spread.

Most people won't realize they have it. That's why it's important that people get tested.

However, going to your doctor/hospital is going to cost you. Most people who want to save money or don't have good insurance will tough it out. If you can't afford testing you also probably can't afford to miss work.

Therefore  the gig economy is going to be the leading cause of transmission in our  country. People driving lyft/uber, delivering for amazon/grubhub, taking a second or third shift at Walmart or your local gas station.

People who aren't high risk of it being fatal can work through it by staying  hydrated and taking over the counter pain killers. I'm not saying you should, but unfortunately there are people who will. Most you can't really blame because not working through it means they lose their job and as they are living pay check to pay check it won't be long before they lose their apartment, their car, they go without food, ect.

The president ignoring it for more than a month during his impeachment to keep it out of the news and than calling it a hoax isn't helping either.

The CDC hasn't released the transmission rate yet but it's likely 2+. Meaning for everyone 1 person infected they infect 2 people (at least). If a country gets cases in the ten's of thousands expect a pop as the  powers of 2 really start to take off."

- Most hospitals here are already at full capacity, now they closed all the schools and universities in the country.  
- I'm scared AF for my parents that are both 60+ and with lung problems.   

- Oh, and a few people that were in the hospital *with* the Coronavirus just snuck out and infected other people because they wanted to stroll around.   

- And people think they are edgy by saying 'It's not a big deal, it's just like the flu' and stuff like that. (Yes, it hasn't got an extremely high mortality rate, but it's mostly safe *when treated*, but what will you do when there won't be enough space in the hospitals, smartass?)  
  
It makes me furious, and the government didn't do shit for WEEKS because 'we can't just close schools and shops, we would lose millions'.   

Well, guess what, people are fucking DYING and the other countries don't want anything to do with us (for a good reason!) and we are losing *tens of millions* anyway, so congratulations, morons.

Are we seriously believing any of those people, once they're sick, are going to stay home and risk not being able to pay rent, solely to help prevent others from getting it?  Nah son.  They're going to get it, ""power through it,"" cough everywhere and be contagious AF, and spread it to your seamless order, your FreshDirect groceries, and the exteriors of your Amazon packages.

> It is the employee’s responsibility to inform the supervisor in case of an illness, however; supervisors should be vigilant and observe any signs that may indicate that the employee may be sick.

2020-03-04,skeebidybop,Coronavirus,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fdlsfn/coronavirus_deaths_tied_to_nursing_center_came/fjibxl3/,"Full text below:

>SEATTLE — The first public indication that something was wrong inside the Life Care nursing care center in Kirkland, Wash., came on Friday, prompting an alarming sign to go up on the front door: “WE ARE HAVING RESPIRATORY OUTBREAK.”

>Since then, officials have announced a series of coronavirus cases, some of them fatal, from the facility, which has become an ominous symbol of the dangers the virus poses.

>On Tuesday, the authorities made another jarring announcement: The first virus-related deaths tied to the nursing center occurred days earlier than previously known — and well before residents had been quarantined in their rooms.

>A man in his 50s, who was rushed from the facility in a Seattle suburb to a hospital on Feb. 24, died last Wednesday. On the same day, another patient from the center, a woman in her 80s, died at her family home. Both of their deaths have now been attributed to the coronavirus.

>The ire of the relatives of those inside was growing with each new revelation.

>“Because these are elderly and infirm people, it’s like we are waiting for them to be picked off, one by one,” said Kevin Connolly, whose 81-year-old father-in-law, Jerry Wall, has been at Life Care for about a year, recovering from heart and kidney failure.

>Mr. Connolly said about 65 families with relatives in the facility have been in touch after Life Care emailed the families a generic update yesterday but left their email addresses visible. “Everybody on that thread started sharing their stories,” said Jodi Connolly, who said that her father’s regular nurse was not working and that he had not been told why.

>“They are prisoners with no information in there,” she said.
The news that two people from the center died of coronavirus days before officials identified the emerging crisis suggested that the virus had been circulating inside the facility even longer than had been understood. That means it may have been a threat to visitors, workers and residents for days, widening the circle of people who may be at risk.

>Nowhere else in the country has been known to have been hit as hard by the virus as Kirkland.

>Seven residents of the Life Care center were dead from the virus, and seven other people with connections to the home had been sickened by it. One visitor to the center apparently traveled home to North Carolina before testing positive for the virus, an outcome North Carolina officials announced on Tuesday.

>Dr. Chris Spitters, the health officer in Snohomish County, north of Seattle, said resources have become stretched in a way that limits how much officials can focus on any one case
“Really, we’re kind of having to triage our efforts,” he said.

>Across Washington State, nine people have died, the only deaths in the United States in a coronavirus crisis that has killed 3,000 people worldwide. State officials also announced that several more people have been sickened, including two people in their 20s who were hospitalized in the Seattle suburb of Issaquah. On Tuesday, Amazon told employees via email that a worker in one of its many office buildings in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood had tested positive for the virus.

>Dr. Manisha Juthani, an associate professor at Yale School of Medicine who studies infectious diseases in older populations, said it was sad but not unexpected that the virus had reached a nursing facility and, once there, caused multiple deaths.

>“Are we going to see this again in other facilities?” Dr. Juthani said. “Unfortunately, I wouldn’t be surprised if we do.”

>In Kirkland, a quarter of the city’s firefighters and a few police officers have been asked to isolate themselves after they visited the nursing center. A dozen of them had flulike symptoms, an official said.
Families of the nursing facility residents were growing increasingly anxious as residents continued to be kept inside the center, and visits were not allowed.

>“I went from not worrying much to being really worried now,” said Debbie Delosangeles, who said in an interview with The New York Times on Monday that she had been told that her 85-year-old mother had been symptom free. On Tuesday, she learned that her mother’s health had declined. Workers told Ms. Delosangeles that they would treat her mother for her high fever but did not intend to test her for coronavirus unless she developed breathing problems.

>Bridget Parkhill said her 77-year-old mother had been sick inside the facility for nearly a week, and had a breathing issue for a short while, but had not been tested.

>“Mom found out today that a friend that would come see her all the time was in the hospital and not doing well,” Ms. Parkhill said. She said she had visited the facility and walked around the exterior, to see her mother through a window.

>Officials at the Life Care center have said that they were following federal protocol and were doing the best they could given a chaotic situation. At Harborview Medical Center, where one person has died, officials were working to determine which staff members may have been exposed to the virus.

.Officials in Washington State were rushing to take steps to contain the spread. Health officials were asking the State Legislature for an additional $100 million in funding to help respond to the virus. Some leaders were weighing widespread closings of events.

>Businesses, schools and houses of worship altered their practices. Amazon and Microsoft have turned events related to International Women’s Day later this week into online meetings. The Archdiocese of Seattle indefinitely postponed an annual Mass and dance for people with disabilities that had been set for Saturday. And a baseball league for youths told parents that players would be discouraged from giving high-fives and handshakes.

>Officials from the Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday that they were closing a Seattle field office of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services after an employee visited the Kirkland nursing care facility and developed symptoms of illness. The employee had been going to work after the visit but before getting sick.

>Dr. Spitters, the health officer in Snohomish County, said officials may get to a point where they need to limit public gatherings, such as high school basketball games and conventions.

>“These things could end up becoming temporarily discouraged, if not prohibited,” Dr. Spitters said."

2020-03-04,agehaw,Coronavirus,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fcr8dy/daily_discussion_post_march_3_2020_questions/fjft3ph/,"I’m kind of annoyed how ppl in the US are so relaxed about the coronavirus after seeing country after country falling to its victim, citing a .2% CFR for younger age brackets and dismissing it as something “just like the flu.” Yes, the likelihood of you dying from it is probably lower than the chance of getting into a car accident in certain cities, but here are a few things I want to note:

1. COVID-19 has a moderately high rate to cause severe syndrome (studies vary but the reports I’ve seen seems to think the rate is somewhere between 17-20%) - i.e one out of 5 or 6 patients will need hospitalization. These are highly infectious patients who will need specialized hospital rooms, constant oxygen supply, protective gear for the doctors/nurses/medics and an estimate of half of them may need ICU care (ventilators even ECMOs and who know what else). This may not seem a problem when a hundred ppl are infected in an area, but if thousands or tens of thousands are infected, imagine the pressure it has on local hospitals. This was what happened in Wuhan in January - too many patients and not nearly enough hospital beds nor doctors/nurses. Ppl with severe syndrome progress to life threatening condition due to lack of care and many of of them died before being admitted into ICU or even a regular hospital room.  Hence the much higher fatality rate in Wuhan compared to other places. I agree we have much more and better hospital resources here but by how much I have no idea. Do we really want to run a stress test on this by allowing the virus to transmit freely?

2. It’s true that a .2% mortality shouldn’t concern most health young ppl but please be mindful of the elderly and weak folks around you. Given the long incubation period of this virus, many ppl may be infectious and spreading the virus to their loved ones, coworkers and other random ppl without knowing, for days. So to exercise precaution now really isn’t about being paranoid about a remote chance of death, it’s also accepting the social responsibility that one wishes not to become a spreader of a virus that can be quite deadly for others. 

3. I understand the need to keep the public from panicking and not halt the economy completely like what China did but why can’t the government be honest with this? Let’s just acknowledge that this is a difficult balance to strike - shutting down too early the economy will take more hit, chance it for too long the damage this virus causes may overtake the initial economic savings. This is a policy decision not a scientific one. The result will make a difference for politicians afterwards as reflected by a bunch of numbers. But for a lot of regular folks, this decision may mean everything to them - some will lose their jobs and others may never see the next spring. Don’t they deserve to know the facts and at least be educated on the risks involved? Why isn’t the US testing it’s public as do the other countries? At what threshold should the local authorities cancel schools and large gatherings as a precaution? It’s not ok to keep being told everything will be ok without any factual support."

The DNC Convention is wrapping up. Next on the schedule is Biden's acceptance speech. The room goes completely dark. There is soft murmuring. 

Then, Back in Black starts playing. Barack Obama is walking down a catwalk (how the hell did that get there? Nobody knows). He's strutting down in a black pleather suit. He shouts into a microphone, ""Are my fellow americans ready to ROCK?""

The crowd is losing. Their. Shit. The camera pans to the middle of the crowd and it's Hillary fucking Clinton smoking a cigar in a black pleather pantsuit. She screams into a megaphone ""Instead of the glass ceiling let's break the ROOF off this place!"" She gets up on the catwalk and Obama initiates an *impressively* complex handshake, which HRC nails. 

Back in Black ends. Then, a live rendition of Sabotage by the Beastie Boys starts playing, with the iconic bass riff leading the crowd to near bedlam. A spotlight appears on stage: Beto O'Rourke is the bass player in question, shirtless (with black pleather pants). 

When the last verse drops, a military jeep roars across the stage, coming to a nickel stop right next to Beto. In it? LL Cool J, Pete Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar. Klob, holding a stapler in one hand (also if it wasn't fucking clear they're all also in black pleather) uses her other hand to reach down and grab four Yuenglings, which she tosses to Cool J, Beto, and Pete. She uses the stapler to burst open the can and shotguns it. The other three headbutt theirs and follow suit. 

O Fortuna begins playing (with a live choir conducted (as most DNC happenings are) by George Soros) (they're also all in- you know what, I think you already know)

A Harley Road King roars onstage, and a man decked head to toe in black pleather is on top with a diamond insignia on a full helmet. Joe Biden takes off his helmet to deafening applause. Gangsta Boogie begins playing. Joe, Obama, and Hilldawg simultaneously shout ""DON'T CALL IT A COMEBACK""

A huge photo of Donald Trump appears in the background, and LL Cool J, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton trade verses and rhymes in the song Mama Said Knock You Out. 

Afterward, Joe Biden shouts ""let's fuckin' get it,"" drops his mic, and departs with everyone on stage. A message that says ""Thank You for Coming"" and the lights are raised. Everyone departs. Trump resigns immediately, far too intimidated to go against Joe. Stonks, wages, and lifespan increase significantly, and 100 percent of America is employed and has affordable healthcare coverage. Iran stops building nukes. Putin stops assassinating his classmates. China deposes Xi, stops practicing intellectual theft, cures Coronavirus, and unfucks their society in other grand ways.

Door handles, escalator handrails, self-service checkouts; objects we touch every day without much thought that could become key to containing the spread of the coronavirus.

It tends to survive best on hard metal and plastic surfaces, and COVID-19 is thought to behave similarly.

That could mean things like escalator handrails, self-service checkouts, door handles, touch screens at fast food restaurants and cinemas, and vending machines.

How long could Coronavirus survive on such objets?
""It can depend on the nature of the surface, the temperature, the humidity. It could be hours, certainly enough time for people to touch it and potentially become infected.

Dr Killingley said it could be a ""lottery"" as to how people become infected with COVID-19, but that your chances of getting infected from an object could be limited by your own personal hygiene.

""The chance of touching one thing and getting infected is pretty low,"" he told Sky News.

""It would be pretty unlucky, (but) it's a bit of a lottery. It's really the cumulative risk of touching lots of things, and then it comes down to how much you touch your face.

One thing you should not rely on to protect you is a mask.

""You can understand why people are doing it - every picture you see you see people are wearing face masks - but masks don't protect you from infection,"" said Dr Killingley.

""They are useful for healthcare workers because we change them regularly. We wouldn't wear a mask for any longer than 30 minutes."

This is HUGE news as there have been proponents of IVC (intravenous c) to fight acute viral infection for decades, with a mountain of evidence supporting it, but the pharmaceutical industry has refused to acknowledge it despite peer reviewed papers confirming the results.

&#x200B;

Here is a second example of a hospital in Wuhan coming to the same conclusion:

[http://2yuan.xjtu.edu.cn/Html/News/Articles/21774.html](http://2yuan.xjtu.edu.cn/Html/News/Articles/21774.html)

&#x200B;

Here is Dr. Richard Cheng (PhD, MD) in China now as an Epidemic Medical Support Team Leader confirming that there are already three official clinical trials of high-dose vitamin c underway in China alone: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMDX0RSDp1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMDX0RSDp1k)

Here is just one of them: [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533)

&#x200B;

Here is Dr. Cheng again, this time relaying a recent anecdote of a high-risk woman who survived after going on ECMO with IVC: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-elCYFhqJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-elCYFhqJs) 

&#x200B;

The same thing is happening in Korea. Hospitals all over China and Korea are beginning to admit that high-dose vitamin c is a highly effective therapy (for those who have been willing to test it). The West refuses to report on this, there is a media blackout on it, because there is so much money at stake. Trump just held a conference in the White House with pharma companies on developing a vaccine, they refuse to report on these developments because there are trillions in revenue from both acute and chronic disease that could be ameliorated with IVC (not only this one pandemic): here is the round table [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mzSlaA2Td0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mzSlaA2Td0) 

 Why vitamin c?

99.9% of the animal kingdom biosynthesizes its own vitamin c. All the top doctors who have investigated this subject believe that the optimal human dose of vitamin c for your average adult is around three to five grams per day. You cannot possibly get this from a diet of fruits or any other food. This optimal number is extrapolated based on what other animals biosynthesize (or ingest in the case of the rare animals that cannot biosynthesize, such as fruit bats) in terms of milligrams ascorbate per kilogram body weight. The funny thing is that across the entire spectrum of the animal kingdom, all animals seem to follow nearly the same dose of milligrams ascorbate per kilogram body weight, universally. Mind you this is for a healthy animals, not one that is sick. Linus Pauling recommended about 3 g per day for a healthy human adult, in powdered form, dissolved in citrus juice such as orange juice, spread throughout the day (for example 1 gram in the morning, 1 gram in the afternoon, 1 gram in the evening evening). It's true that some of it will come out in your urine, Dr Pauling tested this. He found that, of the three grams that he took, a relatively minor percentage came out in urine. Given how cheap powdered vitamin c is, this is not a concern, and accordingly actively protected his urinary tract since vitamin c by its nature reduces oxidative stress. He lived to be 93 following his own advice (which included taking Lysine for cardiovascular support).

&#x200B;

If you become acutely ill from a viral infection such as swine flu or coronavirus, and you were hospitalized, you would want intravenous vitamin c in the range of about half a gram per kilogram body weight per day. The numbers for a healthy human, and one under extreme stress or finding a disease are vastly different. The same is true in the animal kingdom. A healthy dog does not biosynthesize nearly as much vitamin c as one that is fighting an illness, by orders of magnitude. 

 Liposomal vitamin c can be used to elevate serum levels when intravenous is not available. LivOn labs makes the only form I am aware of that is composed of true liposomes. It's expensive but worth it in a life/death situation (only the elderly/infirm would likely need this, so you could have some on hand for your parents for example). It works by depositing the vitamin c directly into cells (normally vitamin c competes with glucose for cell uptake, and takes energy to pump into the cells, it also has a relatively low absorption compared to liposomal).

This article was published on ABC news (Australia) confirming the testing method for Covid-19.

""Testing  methods worldwide include a blood test, a swab test inside  your nose  or in the back of your throat, or a sputum (mix of saliva and  mucus)  test.

The blood test format or  serology method (the  examination of blood serum) is currently not  available in Australia,  where it is more likely the test will be a  nasal swab, as per the  guidelines set out by the [Department of Health for pathologists](https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/02/phln-guidance-on-laboratory-testing-for-sars-cov-2-the-virus-that-causes-covid-19.pdf)"".

Swab tests are officially called RT-PCR tests, they compare the sample taken from your throat to a sample of the virus.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse\_transcription\_polymerase\_chain\_reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction)

The  other method of testing, the gold standard, is the CT scan. As this is a  lower respiratory virus throat swaps are not as sensitive as CT scans  when determining if you are inflicted with the virus.

The  below article outlines the comparison between the CT scan and the  RT-PCR tests. For 888 positive CT result there were only 601 positive  swab tests.

The ""researchers"" basically found 4 amino acid residues in the viruses RNA that matched with HIV. They went on to claim that this was ""unusual"" and ""unlikely to naturally occur"".

While they were right in the fact that the ""inserts"" *did* *somewhat* match of those with HIV, they forgot to mention that they were an even *better match* with around 200 other viruses of all kinds that were completely unrelated to each other, *amongst them SARS, MERS and multiple animal coronaviruses found in nature that are closely related to the novel Coronavirus*. Virologists debunking the paper also said that the amino acid residues in question were hilariously small(meaning that statistically these similair combinations are likely to be found just by random chance between completely unrelated viruses anyway) and the match was functionally irrelevant, so it would not have even made any goddamn sense to insert those amino residues to the virus.

To use a metaphor, it was as if you took 2 completely random, 200 page books and found a matching combination of 4 arbitary words that exist in both books and used that as proof to claim that they are both written by the same writer."

I saw a post with 60,000 likes from a nurse that was shared and spread life wildfire.  In it, she claimed that the novel coronavirus is absolutely nothing to worry about.  She claimed that it was less fatal than the flu, citing accumaltive numbers from a whole season of influenza versus only 2 months of COV-19.  To make matters worse her reccomended course of action was to get your flu vaccine because ""it doesn't cause autism.""  She also claimed 0 deaths in the United States.

When I demonstrated to what extent she was spreading misinformation and why, citing sources, I had 40 laughing emojis and people were looking up my personal occupation saying ""You are a \_\_\_\_\_\_ and you are arguing with a health professional? Do you know how stupid you sound?"" and was told to ""stop watching liberal media"" and that I was ""fear-mongering.""  People of all ages attacked me in every way possible simply for stating that so far, COV-19 has a much higher mortality rate and for correcting her on the amount of deaths in the US.  I don't even watch the news but these people have become completely blinded by it's coverage on it.

It was the single most disrespectful and humiliating thing I've ever seen on Facebook, never have I been attacked in so many ways simply for pointing out this ""professional"" nurse was wrong (and I had no room to correct her because my occupation is X).  I encourage anyone on here that still somewhat uses Facebook to try to promote better awareness on this issue: not to induce panic or tell people to run for the bunker, but to make them aware that just because you are young and may easily recover from this if you get it, that doesn't mean the elderly should suffer and die because you won't wash your hands or take the situation seriously at all."

CDC estimates that [35.5 million people were sick with influenza in 2019](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html), 16.5 million going to a healthcare provider, and 490,600 hospitalizations and 34,200 deaths that makes the influenza death rate 0.00096%.

The coronavirus death rate of 3.5% of the individuals who get it if that death rate for coronavirus was for influenza and was the same that would be a death toll of 1,242,500 people.

I understand your message, I don't think hoarding is the answer either, I think the answer is better healthcare and better oversight over countries that clearly lie about the severity of the outbreak when it initially occurs.

You simply cannot use coronavirus data and influenza data, compare the two, and draw conclusions about the hysteria surrounding this as a way to comment on people who are hoarding. On another note, the hoarding you are seeing is an immediate overreaction to supply issue as a response to the beginning of a serious virus, the supply will of course increase as these companies will want to improve revenue.

I think your thoughts are seriously misguided as the panic isn't unnecessary and this is incredibly serious. It does not matter if the virus only affects individuals are immunocompromised, that still makes up for a large portion of the population, and what if it mutates? I think your reasoning is flawed, and you are reacting to initial issues caused by supply and demand and are not thinking about the true severity of what we are experiencing.

Going in sick isn't noble self-sacrifice, it's endangering people around you. I argue this case for minor illnesses; I'll shout it for serious infections.

Sick days are not just for your own recovery. In most cases, you'll feel just as sick, and recover just as fast, at work. The point is to avoid getting everyone around you sick. You know those offices where everyone passes around respiratory viruses all winter? No one wants that office. But especially no one wants that office when the respiratory virus is more lethal than usual and there are already sick, old, and potentially immunocompromised people around.

If you have the coronavirus, ***do not go to work***. Not a little bit of work, not urgent patients only. Because even if you take all possible precautions, you are exposing your patients and especially your colleagues to potential infection. Cascading infection among healthcare workers is a predictable and modifiable way to have our healthcare system collapse.

Thinking you're irreplaceable is narcissistic. If everyone in the hospital is sick at once and it's catastrophic, strap on your mask and get to work, I guess, but only if it truly does come to that. Otherwise, ***stay out of the hospital so that it doesn't come to that.***"

An N95 will actually filter particles that are smaller or larger than 0.3 microns more effectively than it will 0.3 micron particles. It’s also important to keep in mind that single virus particles are not responsible for the transmission of this disease—the evidence currently suggests that droplets, which typically average around 50-100 microns in diameter, play a larger role in the transmission of the coronavirus. So, a properly fitted N95 would definitely be much more than 95% effective at collecting virus-containing particles"

Having a **reasonable** cost to medical services helps offset the kneejerk reaction to get immediately tested upon sneezing once.

She addresses the common denial that ""this is just the flu, the flu kills"" as unscientific nonsense.

I transcribed some highlights from her video:

\-----

(Speaker is Dr. Dena Grayson - Pandemic disease expert, MD and PhD in biochemistry and molecular cell biology. Dr. Grayson helped research and develop BCX4430, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is active against Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever, Zika, and other deadly viral diseases.)

""You hear a lot of non-scientific spin that says 'hey the flu kills a lot more people! This is not a big deal!' Well look, the flu is a serious sickness, and it does kills a lot of people. But there are treatments and vaccines for the flu. Overall, the threat for a pandemic is far lower, because we have so many who have immunity in addition to the treatments.

We are now squarely in the Pandemic phase. It's the early stages of pandemic, but pandemic nonetheless.

Unfortunately, we have no medication or treatment that works against this coronavirus, including antivirals.

The 1918 Spanish Flu that killed 50 million worldwide (population 1.9 billion) had a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of \~2.5%, whereas usual seasonal flu is 0.1%. This coronavirus has a global CFR of 3.4%

My prediction is this will die down a little bit in the summer months, but come fall, we will see a large increase of cases, much as happened with the 1918 spanish flu. The vast majority of infections and deaths occurred during that 2nd wave.

What can you do now to help prevent spread? Well #1,[\#2through](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/2through?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG) 5 are all the same things: wash your hands.

Wash your hands, 20 full seconds with warm soapy water. Do not touch your face, not even hands to your hair while out in public. Don't press anything with fingertips, use elbow when you can.

Stock up on prescription medications now. A lot of prescription medication is either made in china, or their backbones are made in china. There could be a shortage."""

A) The first large scale detection we made as at a nursing home, full of some of the most at-risk patients.

B) Until very recently (like, today or tomorrow) our testing capacity has been extremely restrained. Which means only the most severe cases are being tested. That's a _very strong_ selection bias that would show a higher mortality rate than typical for the coronavirus. It's likely there's a lot of undetected cases due to our limited testing capacity.

C) Sample size. With such a small sample-size, I would be careful drawing _any_ conclusions from the ratios yet. Weird things happen by random sometimes..."

'Generation Me' must start thinking about others if we're to stop the spread of coronavirus
 Can the 'Me' Generation make sacrifices for the good of those vulnerable to coronavirus?
Can the 'Me' Generation make sacrifices for the good of those vulnerable to coronavirus? Credit: Reuters
You can tell that this coronavirus thing has got serious. Not because the Prime Minister yesterday published a “battle plan”, but because the French have banned kissing. That doesn’t mean giving up snogging their mistresses, obviously. There are limits to the sacrifices anyone can reasonably be expected to make. But those two-cheek pecks for acquaintances have been suspended, as is the Anglo-Saxon handshake, while governments and virologists figure out whether we’ll all be dead in six weeks, or should press pause on that holiday.

Meanwhile, we are supposed to tap feet or bump elbows to greet one another and generally carry on like a scout unit trying to master Ging Gang Goolie.

Not me. Frankly, I was damned if I was going to panic. No way would I be scouring the internet for a stupid face-mask that offered little or no protection. As for global markets, they were showing a pathetic lack of gumption. A few thousands people catch a cold from bat soup in China and the Dow Jones is in intensive care before you can say, “Bless you!”

What is wrong with people? In the West, life is so comfortable that we have forgotten what real peril is and the merest wrinkle turns into a mountain range. 

 Bang on cue, my favourite New York hypochondriac Facetimed me to share a personal triumph. Sheryl told me that she had managed to purchase five hazmat suits to protect her immediate family from the coronavirus.

“What, not those weird decontamination outfits they wear alien films?” I asked.

“Yeah, those. You think I’m ridiculous, right?” 

“No, err, is hazmat kosher?”  

Yes, of course I thought she was being ridiculous. And then I went to Waitrose. Picking up some hand sanitiser seemed like a sensible precaution, particularly as I was heading into London where escalator handrails have been touched by a million clammy mitts. The shelves were not just empty, they appeared to have been recently ransacked. Nearby soap dispensers were all cleaned out as well. It was eerie. The feeling of relief that surged through me when I found one remaining anti-bacterial liquid which, in the melee, had found its way into the shampoos, was almost overwhelming.  

This competitive fear of not being fearful enough – or less well-protected than others - took me by surprise. Covid-19 is highly contagious, but so is panic. Overnight, I became obsessive. I bought rubbing alcohol to sterilise our electronic devices. I used my my sleeve to open doors. I lectured my family on washing their hands. The touching sight of a line of women at the basins in the John Lewis loos, all silently mouthing the first verse of God Save the Queen as they soaped fingers and thumbs, was proof that I was not alone. We were all doing our bit.

But it was more than that. Faced with this new threat, something atavistic kicked in. People started stockpiling food and medical supplies. Shortages meant higher prices. One London pharmacy was caught selling a £1.99 hand sanitizer for just under thirty quid. When I managed to bag a box of antimicrobial wipes at vast expense on Amazon, I actually found myself gloating. After all, antimicrobial is SO superior to antibacterial for combatting corona! 

What on earth had got into me? I was behaving exactly like the kind of selfish, panic-stricken nightmare I usually despise.

The fact is the coronavirus presents us with a challenge that is as much about the duty we owe to one another as it is about preventing its spread. The two are intimately linked. To keep down the number of fatalities, those of us who are stronger are going to have to put the interests of the weakest first. Britons will need to show stoicism, patience and resourcefulness - virtues we may suspect are in short supply if not extinct. Is our selfish, highly individualistic, me-me-me society up to meeting that challenge?     

Despite what you may have read, this is neither the Black Death nor one of those terrifying fevers that carried off Thomas Cromwell’s wife and small daughters in Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall trilogy. Covid-19 may be making headlines, but what they don’t tell you is that many thousands who have already had it are now fully recovered. Seasonal influenza kills between 290,000 and 650,00 people worldwide each year. There are 90,000 coronavirus cases so far, with about 3,000 deaths.

The latter does seem to have a higher fatality rate, but some groups are a lot more vulnerable than others. Eight out of ten people who get corona will have only a mild illness. (Worth bearing in mind when you are engaged in a fight to the death for the last packet of Nurofen). Children rarely catch it, thank goodness. The people at the greatest risk are the elderly and those with compromised immune systems.

To be blunt, if a generally healthy person with symptoms of the coronavirus turns up at A&E demanding treatment, chances are they will infect a vulnerable person – perhaps someone undergoing chemotherapy - who won’t be able to fight it off. Such hospital places as are available should rightfully belong to the very sick and older people who will need all the help they can get. As Marc Lipsitch, the director of the US’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, puts it: “The emphasis has shifted from stopping them from infecting us to stopping us from infecting each other.” 

Can the “Me” generation, who have never been denied anything in their privileged lives, be relied upon to self-isolate or will they start whingeing how “stressy” it all is when the authorities try to curtail their freedom to even a minor degree? The first person to get coronavirus in North Korea was shot. An option some of us might wish was available here when that thoughtless prat on the train coughs enthusiastically over his elderly neighbour.

I’m afraid that the current mumps epidemic shows what we’re up against. Two of my friend’s children, both in their twenties, are among the thousands of students who have suffered in the past year from this horrible disease. Mumps had largely died out, but there was a fall in the uptake of the MMR vaccine in the Nineties, when the current generation of students was born. My friend’s son and daughter were both vaccinated, but it turns out that wasn’t enough to protect them against this resurgent strain. 

Those of us who obediently did as we were told, now see our own youngsters put in danger by those self-righteous anti-vaxxers who watched alarmist videos online and decided they knew better than the medical establishment. Their little darlings would be protected, or so they thought, because enough responsible parents would make sure their children had the jab and thus guarantee herd immunity. 

Only it hasn’t worked out like that. Believing that not vaccinating little Harry or Hettie is more important than the chance they could get measles, give it to a pregnant woman and blind her unborn baby, is the height of selfish individualism - one of the most aggressive and incurable sicknesses of the modern age.  

Well, the coronavirus now demands that we take one for the herd. If we all do as we’re told to by the Chief Medical Officer, if we pull together, follow sensible advice and modify our behaviour; if we accept that our non-emergency operation may be cancelled because doctors and nurses are needed elsewhere, then countless lives will be saved. Even if everyone just washed their hands it would reduce the spread of infection by over half. That’s an awful lot of beloved grandparents not put in mortal danger.  

It’s up to the younger and the stronger now to repay the sacrifices of the older generation with sacrifices of their own. To prove that, when it really matters, the “Me” generation can become “Us”. Too many lives are in their sanitised hands.

During the 2009 influenza pandemic, the earliest reports listed 59 deaths from approximately 850 suspected cases, which suggested an extremely high case fatality of 7%.


However, the initially reported information of 850 cases was a gross underestimate. This was simply due to a much larger number of mild cases that did not report to any health system and were not counted. After several months — when pandemic data had been collected from many countries experiencing an epidemic wave — the 2009 influenza turned out to be much milder than was thought in the initial weeks.

It’s not that creating a vaccine for the other coronaviruses is difficult, it’s that there hasn’t been a lot of pressure for it. Pre-COVID19 there were six strains of coronavirus. Four of them cause 1/3 of all colds, and that just isn’t worth pouring time and money into creating a vaccine for. One causes SARS and we did work on a vaccine and from what I understand made a ton of headway, but then SARS just died out and there hasn’t been a case since 2003, so there wasn’t a lot of need for it. However some of the research that went into that is being repurposed for COVID19.

I can’t explain MERS, but MERS has very very few cases and mostly all of them are in Saudi Arabia so we can speculate on why no one cares to create a vaccine for that."

Driving one evening in Wuhan, China, last month, Zhang Xiaochun pulled her car to the side of the road. She was on the verge of a breakdown.

She’d been working nonstop for days at the center of China’s coronavirus outbreak, where she is a doctor. Both of her parents had Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, as did many of her colleagues. The number of sick and dying was climbing. And on this day, Dr. Zhang had forgotten about her 9-year-old daughter, who was home alone and scared—and who, at that moment, wasn’t picking up the phone.

Dr. Zhang’s eyes welled up, but she had no energy to cry. “My tears wouldn’t flow,” she said in an interview on Feb. 18.

Around the world, doctors are being stretched to the limit. Short on supplies and sleep, they’re being asked to stop a global pandemic that no one fully understands. Adding to that strain, they’re risking their own health while they diagnose cases and attend to sick patients—along with the health of their spouses, children and other close family members.

With the virus now growing more quickly outside China than inside, it’s a problem other countries will increasingly face.

In China, more than 3,000 doctors have been infected, according to official data, and at least 22 have died. Some medical professionals believe the numbers are even higher, adding uncertainty for doctors elsewhere confronting the virus. Untold numbers of family members have fallen ill."

Mortality is difficult to estimate. It’s as high as 7% in the US and 0.8% in Spain. I’m looking at the top 10 countries in Wiki’s list as they are the most populace, traveled and have the highest number of cases. 

If we look at the estimated mortalities that I’ve chosen: 2.3% & 3.75% we can make certain educated guesses about what we’re going to see here in the US. First we need to look at the R0 of the flu and corvid to find out how many people we can expect to be infected. For the flu with an R0 of 1.3 in 2017-2018 45,000,000 people were infected. The R0 of corvid is 175% larger. 1.75 times 45,000,000 and we come up with a possible number of infections of 78,750,000 people or 23% of the US population. Interestingly enough Australia is predicting “at least” 25%^5. If the mortality rate is 2.3% that means 1,811,250 will die from corvid-2019. At a mortality rate of 3.75% 2,953,125 people will die. Or 0.5% of the US population or 0.9% of the US population. God help us if it’s a 7% mortality. 

What this means if you can go your whole life without knowing someone who died from the flu. You’re going to know multiple people who died from corvid-2019. There are going to be disruptions to service. .

THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THIS. Many (dare I say most?) hospitalized patients are in the hospital simply because they have pneumonia which may impair their oxygenation unassisted. This can and frequently does happen with no physical ""damage"" to the lungs, but rather as an overactive response by the body. The doctors will tell you specifically if you are experiencing notable fibrosis, and even if you did, there is nothing to suggest that the fibrosis continues after the infection is resolved - it develops in response to the damage that again, CAN (not will), be caused while you are infected. So even if you do take a fibrosis hit, its not comparable to a disease that causes unceasing fibrosis like autoimmune disorders.

So to answer your question, if you are cured of coronavirus and are back on your feet again, you can pretty much expect that to be the end of it (still more research about possible residual effects but we are seeing quite a few very old/sick people in China seemingly close to their previous levels after being discharged). If however you get hit very very hard and it goes beyond just moderate pneumonia, then yes you could be looking at chronic issues, but again, no evidence that they would be progressive."

You’re also a parent, so you can’t rely on your wife to care for your daughters ‘outbursts’ all the time. You should be able to work with your daughter in the same manner your wife does.

If the only reason you cited was your mom’s help falling through, I’d say no assholes here. If it were just the coronavirus I’d say follow the CDC’s guidance. But wanting her to stay behind because she’s better than you at handling your daughter’s tantrums? My dude, that’s a complete asshole mentality.

 First, your wife shouldn’t be shackled to your home because you can’t be bothered to parent your child. You don’t say how old she is, but all young children get thrown off by changes in routine. This one was planned for and she has a parent to see her through it at home— it’s about as ideal a circumstance to get her acclimated to routine changes as could be hoped for. You need to learn what works for your daughter when she’s upset (by, I don’t know, asking your wife?) and get used to doing it. It’s distressing to comfort a distressed child— but that’s the job, friend. Stop slacking."

I asked to switch my first grade daughter to independent study on Monday because I live in Santa Clara county, we have had a fever & malaise illness going around the family for the past week, and I don't want my kids to spread coronavirus around and kill vulnerable people (they are 4 and 6, they spread EVERYTHING around).

The school says my daughter can't take excused absences unless she herself is sick. Right now since she no longer has a fever we are taking unexcused absences and she is following along with her math program from home, which is available online.

I think in order to get through this we are going to have to increase social distancing every way we can. I am willing to help out with this by keeping my kids at home and doing remote learning for a while, but currently the school district policy making me feel guilty about this choice, like I am making things difficult for them. I believe I am making a responsible choice, and she is even keeping up with her work, so what is the harm?

Also currently the rule is no school until you are fever-free for 24 h. I think because of coronavirus this should be strengthened to no school unless your whole family has been fever-free for 24 h. I am aware of another student in my daughter's class whose mother has a bad flu-like illness, but she is still at school. If this mother wanted to keep her daughter home and gave this as a reason, it would be an unexcused absence."

It’s a disease caused by a novel virus “SARS-CoV-2”. Novel of course means in this case that it has never infected humans before now. 

You are correct that it is a coronavirus, and those have been around for ages (common cold for example). That’s like announcing we found a new species of great ape living in the Pacific Northwest, but it’s not a big deal because apes have been around forever. 

It currently has a smaller impact than the flu, but the potential is much worse. The mortality rate is estimated to be 3.5% compared to 0.1% for the flu. 16% of cases result in serious illness (hospitalization). My point being that if this infects as many people as the flu there’s a good chance that you or someone you care about will be seriously impacted (literally millions dead, many more hospitalized). 

I agree we shouldn’t panic, but downplaying it to such a degree I think is irresponsible. 

There’s a reason almost half of China is on lockdown because of this.

COVID-19 kills your lung cells, common cold kills your nose and throat cells. This is over simplifying it, but it gets the message across.

Edit: since I was getting downvoted, and now the vote count is back to neutral I'm going to back up my sources.[The receptor that was isolated to being the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5389864/) The long form is Angiotensin Converting enzyme 2. A common drug that acts on this pathway is ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril, which is on The Who's list of essential drugs and a first line treatment for hypertension, heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy when the comorbidity is hypertension.

&#x200B;

The common cold is USUALLY Rhinovirus, and binds to a receptor called ICAM1. This receptor is all over the body, but Rhinovirus is cryophylic and  acid label. This means it likes cold temperatures and dies in acid, such as what you'd find in your stomach.

&#x200B;

The next most common cause of the cold is coronavirus.Specifically Human Coronavirus  OC43,  [have hemagglutinin-esterase activity and probably utilize sialic acid residues as receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3380803).

It doesn’t mean it’s now a death sentence, it means that the virus used natural processes to become more effective (its sole purpose.) Here’s the abstract about the two different strains they researched:

> The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since impacted a large portion of China and raised major global concern. Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by mutations and natural selection besides recombination. Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (∼70%) is more prevalent than the S type (∼30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure. These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."

I have seen a lot of your posts be pretty down on him (even despite political leanings, and I'll describe why below).

The question to ask yourself is this: Is Bernie a true believer in his ideals?

The man has been railing on about his radical political beliefs for a long time. He has been perceived as a radical for most of his life, and has made a successful political career out of it.

He's also been an independent for a great deal of his political life; of the 1900+ US Senators in the history of the US, only 77 have been some type of independent Senator. And he continues to be one, despite caucusing with the Democratic Party for a long time.  That takes a lot of fortitude.

Lastly, according to the [guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/mar/02/democratic-primary-2020-latest-delegate-count), Biden has 566 delegates and Bernie has 501. That's very close. (For reference, Elizabeth Warren is the next down from Bernie and she has 61). 

So, being a true believer, an independent-minded individual, and having 65 delegates shy of Biden, you have to imagine being Bernie Sanders is complicated. Especially if you represent a very different vision of America.

Now, all that being said, and in my personal opinion, now that powerful people and entities have coalesced around Biden this will result in Bernie's campaign and chances being smashed into the ground. But it's going to happen over a significant time, because Bernie isn't going to give up. He'll keep racking up loss after loss in state after state, but also gaining significant delegates along the way. I'm sure he is trying to be optimistic, and he wants to believe that he can turn the tide, but outside something like Elizabeth Warren dropping and endorsing him or something insane like Barack Obama endorsing him, he'll probably continue to lose states. 

With *that* being said, it makes sense that the current close #2 Democratic candidate remain in the running until the Democratic convention. That is because a lot of things can happen between now and then. Biden could have health problems (so could Bernie, for that matter) - they are both quite old to be campaigning like they are. Biden could have a scandal pop up. Or perhaps the American people might change their perception tremendously because of potential economic fears like a stock market over-correction or a recession, or perhaps the coronavirus could become a huge problem in the US. This might affect voters. Also, there is a debate coming up in a week and half, and if it is Bernie and Warren vs Biden, that might change perceptions (in either direction).

Lastly, and this is my current opinion: I believe a great deal of Bernie's interest in being a US Senator and aspiring President is to move the overton window in this country. We are far more likely to consider his ideas, no matter the veracity, by him simply being out there giving it attention. That could very well be a goal of his. He destigmatizes socialism, democratic socialism, nordic-style government, etc by going out there and saying his ideas over and over and over."

It was immediately downloaded by hundreds of groups, worldwide. People who are SMEs in this area parsed the genome and identified parts of the genome that produced surface cost proteins for the virus, the spiky things that give the coronavirus its name. Those are often the things the human immune system targets when developing antibodies. 

The different biotech groups cut and pasted that part the genome into an email and sent the message to one of many commercial labs that will produce proteins on demand (for a fee) based on the sequence provided. Each of those protein fragments is believed to be sufficient to produce an antibody response if injected into a human so potentially a vaccine.

There are dozens of groups that have produced protein snippets and thus proto-vaccines. Now animal testing must begin to predict gross safety, then efficacy and more comprehensive safety testing will happen. In the end there will be multiple approved vaccines, almost all from the same genomic upload."

Situation Update:

* As the epidemiology of COVID-19 changes, the affected areas will change. As of **March 4, 2020**, affected areas are: **China, Hong Kong, Iran, Japan, Italy, Singapore, and South Korea**.
* The United States is also reporting increased numbers of COVID-19 cases. Seattle, Washington is reported as having high activity of COVID-19. As of March 4, 2020, 21 confirmed cases and 8 deaths have been reported with 62% of cases over the age of 60. **At the present time, routine testing of travelers returning from Washington State is not recommended**.

**Consider testing for novel coronavirus for:**

* Patients with compatible symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or difficulty breathing) **AND**
* History of travel to an **affected area** (as of Mar. 4, 2020, affected areas include: China, Hong Kong, Iran, Japan, Italy, Singapore, and South Korea) within 14 days prior to illness onset **OR** other index of suspicion (e.g., contact with an ill person with travel to affected areas, contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19)

We do not recommend COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic patients. 

 **Physicians can test for COVID-19** **without** **consulting a Medical Health Officer. (\*\*new\*\*)** To facilitate prompt testing, the BCCDC will now accept either a nasopharyngeal (NP) **or** throat swab for COVID-19 testing (NP swab preferred).

>On the other hand, the virus was killed by twice-a-day cleaning of surfaces and daily cleaning of floors with a commonly used disinfectant, which suggests that current decontamination measures are sufficient as long as people adhere to them.

>The research letter was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and comes after cases in China where the pathogen spread extensively through hospitals, infecting dozens of health care workers and other patients.

>This led scientists to believe that, beyond catching the infection through coughing, environmental contamination was an important factor in the disease's transmission, but its extent was unclear.

>Researchers at Singapore's National Centre for Infectious Diseases and DSO National Laboratories looked at the cases of three patients who were held in isolation rooms between late January and early February.

>They collected samples from their rooms on five days over a two-week period.

>The room of one patient was sampled before routine cleaning, while the rooms of the other two patients were sampled after disinfection measures.

>The patient whose room was sampled before cleaning had the mildest symptoms of the three, only experiencing a cough. The other two had moderate symptoms: both had coughing and fever, one experienced shortness of breath and the other was coughing up lung mucus.

>Despite this disparity, the patient whose room was sampled before cleaning contaminated 13 of 15 room sites testing, including their chair, bed rail, the glass window of their room, the floor, light switches.

>Three of the five toilet sites were also contaminated, including the sink, door handle and toilet bowl - more evidence that stool can be a route of transmission.

>Air samples tested negative, but swabs taken from air exhaust outlets were positive - which suggests that virus-laden droplets may be carried by air flows and deposited on vents.

>""Significant environmental contamination by patients with SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and faecal shedding suggests the environment as a potential medium of transmission and supports the need for strict adherence to environmental and hand hygiene,"" the authors wrote.

>SARS-CoV-2 is the official name of the pathogen.

>The virus, which was first identified in China's Hubei province in December has now infected more than 95,000 people in 81 countries and territories, killing more than 3,200.

Absolute trash organization desperate to create racial tension. Why hasn't CNN been banned from the sub as a low quality source?

We live in a Golden Age with less racism than at any point in history yet rather than celebrate those victories, here is CNN trying to convince people they can't achieve because the world is racist. The most successful people I've met found success began when they started to ignore the nay-sayers and just worked hard at their dreams anyway.

The racism narrative CNN spins promotes blaming every hardship on someone else, never taking accountability for ones action, and acting out in angry emotional outbursts. That's how you prevent developing competence.

There remain a few racists in the world, and I argue it's the bums at CNN. They want to keep people enfeebled and lazy. Dependent. To keep people stuck in cultural gravity and never break free."

The group decided on Sunday to go on holiday, despite the rapid spread of the corona virus in Italy.

Earlier this week, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tightened the recommendation for travel to northern Italy. Non-essential journeys to the area were discouraged to prevent additional coronavirus infections in the Netherlands. The orange color code applies to the Piedmont region, where the students are.

Rector Floris Hamann told the Dagblad van het Noorden on Tuesday ""to be aware of the serious situation"", but to see no reason for a premature return of the students.

The ski trip of the members of Vindicat has led to much outrage and criticism in recent days on social media. The name of the Groningen student club was even trending on Twitter on Wednesday. Vindicat was not available for comment on Wednesday evening. The PVV group also asked the Ministers of Health and Education about the trip in the Lower House. The parliamentarians called the trip ""very irresponsible"" in view of the urgent advice of RIVM to avoid a stay in northern Italy.

You're taking a very extreme edge case example. Italy is second only after China in terms of deaths.

Australia's percentage over 65 years by comparison is [under 16%](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/1CD2B1952AFC5E7ACA257298000F2E76?OpenDocument). In Sydney, it's even lower [at 13.9%](https://profile.id.com.au/australia/five-year-age-groups?WebID=250). Even if we have the same rate of infection, our death toll would likely be lower.

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-map-track-number-cases-death-toll-uk-world/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-map-track-number-cases-death-toll-uk-world/)

According to the above map, we're well below the other countries shown, both in reported cases and deaths.

**COVID-19 : Let's do a Work-From-Home experiment in New York**

With this new coronavirus outbreak, working from home is no longer a privilege, it’s a necessity.

The sanitary risk of a 2019-nCoV outbreak in New York City is an opportunity for most companies to test working from home at scale.

Apart from contributing to a healthier environment, helping employers and employees save money on transportation and office space, and promoting equal opportunities in the employment market, working from home might be the most efficient containment measure each individual could take part of.

Of course, working from home is not ideal, it's a skill, it takes time to acquire, both for employees and employers. It’s going to mean a lot of video chats and phone calls, but many tools are already available for a reasonable price: Slack, Zoom, Yammer, Dropbox, Google Drive.... and or course VPN tools to improve cybersecurity. 

Yes, some jobs are not really adapted. Retail industry for example, but most importantly some critical services like power generation, grid services, communications, and food production. However, those services only require a small percentage of the population to maintain in the modern days.

Focusing first on tech companies, advertising firms, and financial institutions would make sense. A growing number of US companies are already working as fully distributed teams. More recently, some Chinese corporate giants including Alibaba Group and Tencent have asked staff to work from home for one week after an extended Lunar New Year break ends, seeking to limit the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus.

A 2015 study from Stanford University in California found that productivity among employees at a Chinese travel agency went up by 13% when they worked from home due to fewer breaks and more comfortable work environments.

Working from home seems to result in higher productivity, help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, commute congestion, and most importantly would be an efficient measure to contain a possible rapid outbreak of the 2019-nCoV virus in densely populated cities such as New York City.

**It's time for New Yorkers to lead the country's largest work-from-home experiment!**"

The Harvard epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch ... predicts that within the coming year, some 40 to 70 percent of people around the world will be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. But, he clarifies emphatically, this does not mean that all will have severe illnesses. “It’s likely that many will have mild disease, or may be asymptomatic,” he said.

Further on: Lipsitch is far from alone in his belief that this virus will continue to spread widely. The emerging consensus among epidemiologists is that the most likely outcome of this outbreak is a new seasonal disease—a fifth “endemic” coronavirus. With the other four, people are not known to develop long-lasting immunity. If this one follows suit, and if the disease continues to be as severe as it is now, “cold and flu season” could become “cold and flu and COVID-19 season.”"

There are an estimated 115.59 million people in America over the age of 50. So let's do the math and start by whittling this down by age brackets. The 50 to 59 age group has a 1.3% mortality rate, and the 60 to 69 bracket has a 3.6% mortality rate. The 70 to 79 age group has a mortality rate of 8%, and the 80+ age bracket has a 21.9% mortality rate. There are 42.84 million Americans in the 50-59 group, 37.41 million in the 60 to 69 group, 22.66 million in the 70 to 79 group, and 12.68 million in the 80+ group.

That means that the estimated loss of life for Americans will be 6.5 million, and that's not including younger folks and those with existing medical conditions that put them at risk. There's 331 million in America, so that's roughly 2% of the population.

According to the CDC, the flu kills roughly 61,000 people annually and infects about 45 million people annually. That's a fatality ratio of approximately 0.1%. A fair comparison of the math would compare the population bases as a whole in this scenario, so assuming all 331 million people get infected then approximately 331 thousand people would perish.

331k (flu) versus 6.5m (COV19)

So it's obvious the COV19 virus is much much worse, and again that comparison includes young and ill people in the flu counts and doesn't include them in the COV19 counts. So it's likely worse than these statistics suggest.

Airport workers say they lacked training and gloves to clean planes from China

Terrified about the coronavirus outbreak, airline worker Barbara Gomez refused her supervisor’s order to clean the interior of an American Airlines plane when it arrived from China at Los Angeles International Airport.

Gomez, a cabin attendant for JetStream Ground Services, said she was given no gloves or a mask before being told to help wipe down the interior of the plane.

“Everybody is concerned about the virus,” she said of the incident in late January. “We don’t have anything to protect us.”

With the outbreak claiming more than 3,000 lives around the globe, the risk of being infected is on everybody’s mind, especially airline and airport workers like Gomez and her colleagues, who say they have been forced to choose between their jobs and possibly being exposed to the virus.

Over the weekend, an American Airlines flight from New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport to Milan, Italy, was canceled because the flight crew refused to fly to the region that had recently reported an outbreak of the virus. After the cancellation, American Airlines suspended its two daily flights to Milan from New York and Miami until April 25.

In response to the complaints by Gomez and her colleagues, the Los Angeles City Council is expected to hold a hearing Wednesday to request a study by LAX and the Port of Los Angeles about the steps being taken to protect workers against the spread of the virus.

Several JetStream employees took their grievances to the city’s Bureau of Contract Administration on Feb. 19, but an agency spokeswoman said the bureau only has jurisdiction to investigate wage disputes. The Florida company cleans airplanes and handles cargo at 20 of the nation’s busiest airports, working for American, Delta, United and Southwest airlines.

A 2017 Los Angeles ordinance requires all airport employees, including those who work for a contractor at LAX, to undergo 16 hour of emergency response training to teach workers the definition and impact of “hazardous materials” and “infectious diseases” among other subjects. Gomez and several of her co-workers said they don’t recall undergoing such training.

“We were just being thrown out there without the tools we needed,” said Miguel Covarrubias, who has worked for JetStream for 10 months.

Calls and emails to JetStream were not returned. In an interview with NPR, JetStream President Marc Desnoyers said his employees have been given the proper equipment and training to do the job.

“Provisions of cleaning solutions, gloves and all necessary safety equipment, including masks when requested, are closely monitored and replenished when needed,” he told NPR. “When a concern is raised by a team member, we work to address it immediately, as we did with this employee.”

A spokesman for LAX said the airport was not aware of the complaints.

In a statement, American Airlines said: “American Airlines’ vendor management team works in close partnership with all of our vendors, including JetStream, to ensure the health and safety of everyone in the airport environment.”

Before the outbreak, Los Angeles was one of the nation’s top ports of entry for Chinese tourists and business executives, drawing 1.2 million visitors from China in 2018. That all changed after most of the country’s largest carriers suspended flights from China, Hong Kong and Macau, and the Trump administration barred entry of most foreign nationals who had recently visited China.

Before the flights from China were halted, Gomez and her co-workers said they were ordered to clean several inbound American Airlines planes without adequate training or equipment. The workers said they complained to their supervisors who occasionally provided them with gloves but other times urged them to remove gloves from the supply kept in the galleys of the planes for use by flight attendants when preparing and serving food.

“We had to take gloves from the aircraft,” said Jeanine Reese, a JetStream employee from Inglewood.

If workers refused to clean a plane, Reese said, supervisors reprimanded them for being insubordinate.

Gomez said that after she refused to clean the American Airlines plane in January, she convinced her supervisor to reassign her to another plane, explaining that she suffered from asthma and bronchitis and would be more vulnerable to the coronavirus.

“I was the first one to speak up because of my condition with asthma and bronchitis,” she said. “I told my manager ‘No.’ I was very scared.”

Reese and other workers who said they could not refuse to clean several flights from China worried later that they could be infected with the virus.

“We told our managers and one of them said, ‘Don’t even worry about it. That’s in China, not in L.A.,’” said Jose Hidalgo, a JetStream employee from Gardena."

Burioni sono settimane, anzi mesi visto che parla del coronavirus da molto prima che il virus iniziasse a diffondersi in questo modo in Italia. Ha sempre detto quanto sia pericoloso questo virus, e continua a dire che bisogna restare a casa il più possibile per evitare che il virus si diffonda ancora di più, altrimenti il sistema sanitario collasserebbe. 
C'è gente che lo accusa di creare un allarmismo esagerato, e che non c'è bisogno di alzare i toni. 
Ma se usando toni pacati nessuno ascolta, che male ci sarebbe ad alzare i toni e a risultare come arrogante solo per mettere in allerta la gente?
Bisogna si rispettare anche il parere di altri esperti, ma se poi ascolti virologi che continuano a dire che è poco più di un influenza che non bisogna preoccuparsi capisci che risultare arrogante non è poi una brutta cosa.

Tasso mortalità influenza stagionale 0,1%;
Tasso mortalità coronavirus 3,4%;
Cioè questo virus ha un tasso di mortalità 34 volte superiore all'influenza però si continua a dire ""poco di più"". Senza dimenticare che tra il 5% e il 10% dei pazienti ha bisogno di terapia intensiva. Però è sicuramente burioni quello che ha torto..."

A) The first large scale detection we made as at a nursing home, full of some of the most at-risk patients.

B) Until very recently (like, today or tomorrow) our testing capacity has been extremely restrained. Which means only the most severe cases are being tested. That's a very strong selection bias that would show a higher mortality rate than typical for the coronavirus. It's likely there's a lot of undetected cases due to our limited testing capacity.

https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/f9uv4d/chess_sponsor_of_major_online_chess_events_turns/

The kickstarter was [cancelled by kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/soontech/regium-automatic-chess-e-board-0). Nobody has heard from regium.

For a giant scam that hoodwinked two major chess sites, everything actually ended pretty well.

- The scammers lost a lot of money (making the videos, sponsoring the events, and not managing to collect a dime from the kickstarter). 

- The main producer of electronic chessboards (not ones where the pieces move, just ones that record the moves made on the board), DGT, was inspired by the scam and is [investigating if a similar technology could be possible](https://perlenvombodensee.de/2020/02/27/how-a-kickstarter-scam-shook-up-the-chess-business-dgt-about-to-develop-what-regium-has-announced/).

- Renewed interest in self-moving boards prompted the main producer of them, Square Off, to [put a sale on](https://squareoffnow.com/store) so hopefully they made some money.

- Lichess decided to [open a public API](https://lichess.org/blog/XlRW5REAAB8AUJJ-/welcome-lichess-boards) so that people with electronic boards can play on the site without having to use a BOT account.

- Chess.com and chess24 lost some credibility, and hopefully will be more discerning when picking sponsors for their events in the future.

The world of chess is now on to the drama of Coronavirus forcing a few major events to be cancelled, as well as the fact that the upcoming world championship will likely be hosted in Dubai. The ethics of sponsorship has been a recurring drama in chess this past year, since Carlsen (world champion) tried to get his chess federation (norway) to make a sponsorship deal with a gambling company."

>Wolf is also wrong on that account, based on the limited information currently known about the coronavirus. Recent data from the Chinese government set the COVID-19 mortality rate at 2.3%. That’s vastly different from the flu’s mortality rate of 0.1%.

>Experts also said that while it’s possible the mortality rate from the new virus could come close to the flu’s mortality rate eventually ― if the case definition of coronavirus were expanded — it’s too soon to make that assumption with the limited information available.

Also, it’s not just people getting sick or being in quarantine that we might have to contend with. There could be all sorts of shortages in the supply chain, problems with the energy grid, and natural disasters that have nothing to do with Coronavirus. The west coast is due for a planet-bending earthquake, Tennessee just got smashed by tornadoes, the east coast/gulf can look forward to more massive hurricanes soon, and wildfires can spread anywhere with enough landscape to burn.

There have been some reports of ""reinfections"". These could of course be different explanations for this such as SARS-CoV-2 causing an acute infection with a phase with low viral load and a subsidence of symptoms, which can escape the testing which is at least somewhat inaccurate as of this time. It could also be that it's just very easy to catch it again right away. 

That said, could it potentially [conceal itself in neurons as suggested by this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jmv.25728):

>Since SARS-CoV2 may conceal itself in the neurons from the immune recognition, complete clearance of the virus may not be guaranteed even the patients have recovered from the acute infection. In support of this, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is still detectable in some patients during the convalescent period 43. Therefore, given the probable neuroinvasion the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be currently underestimated.

Perhaps it could behave similarly to measles SSPE? Or perhaps have its own distinct mode of persistence? One well credentialed virologist, Mark Harris of the Univeristy of Leeds, has stated that he thinks it may be persistent: 

[The other possibility therefore is that they did not in fact clear the infection but remained persistently infected.  Although coronaviruses generally cause short-term self-limiting infections which are cleared, there is some evidence in the scientific literature for persistent infections of animal coronaviruses (mainly in bats).](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-people-being-re-tested-positive-for-coronavirus-after-initial-recovery-e-g-case-reported-in-japan-where-a-woman-has-been-confirmed-as-a-coronavirus-case-for-2nd-time/)



There's some evidence that SARS can [cause a persistent infection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2395189/pdf/0096-08.pdf). Obviously they are only 80-85% similar (not sure what the currnet consensus is ) and already SARS-CoV-2 has show itself to behave in different ways so just because SARS can in some instances cause one, doesn't mean SARS-CoV-2 will. 

Are there any teams currently working on this question? When can we reasonably expect to have proof that it is either persistent or acute? Thank you very much for your answers!"

Obvious unseen variables could come up, but it looks like Biden captured good enthusiasm (high turnout) and replicated the 2018 midterms electorate (suburban women + minorities). He lacks the long histroy of controversy Clinton had, and it shows in that Sanders lost vote share in some states relative to 2016, meaning there doesn't seem to be a ""not Joe"" contingent of voters like there was a rather large ""not Hillary"" contingent in 2016. 

Trump already fired off on Burisma and it doesn't personally involve Biden so I don't think this will have the legs like Clinton's emails/Benghazi/Bill Clinton/Clinton Foundation stuff did.

There's human influenzas and human coronaviruses. We've known about the flu for a long time but we've only known about coronaviruses since the 1960s. They're called coronavirus because of the shape of a virus (has a halo around it)


Something like 30% of human coronaviruses make up the common cold. Human influenzas and human coronaviruses aren't a big deal because we have immunity to them. The human coronaviruses cause an upper respiratory infection - cold symptoms.


The *scary* stuff (sometimes) is when a virus jumps a species. The Spanish Flu was a swine flu. We had the bird flu scare recently. SARS was a bat coronavirus. This ""SARS 2"" (COVID-19) is a pangolin coronavirus it seems. It's scary because, like SARS, it causes an upper *and* lower respiratory infection. Pneumonia, for example, is a severe lower respiratory infection (infection of the lungs). So COVID-19 can be like spontaneous pneumonia - that's why it's lethal.


Humans have very poor immunity to animal coronaviruses. That's why basically *all* of them are scary to virologists. This pangolin one won't be the last. Good news is that coronavirus vaccines are in the works kind of like flu vaccines. They have been for years *because* of SARS and MERS."

First, I called Swedish's general number and asked the person who answered if I should take special action.

See recommended the virtual doctor and gave met the link.

I went to the link I and created an account. The account seems to be separate from my mycharts account. When I was creating the account, I was asked to provide my name, address, and insurance information.

Then I waited. The estimated wait time was 25-35 minutes, but it took an hour (I was expecting a long wait time). The appointment used webcam. It looked like skype or facetime. I could see the doctor, and she could see me. She held her medical ID up to the camera and asked me to hold up my WA Driver's License to the camera. I did so.

I told her my symptoms and concerns. She asked me if I could tell her my temperature, but I haven't been able to find any store that has a digital thermometer and they're out of them on amazon prime now/amazon fresh, so I don't have one. That's one thing that would've been helpful for me to be at a doctor's office for, since they would've had one. She gave me her advice, I logged off, and in a few minutes I got a notification that my mycharts account had been updated with new information. It shows up as a normal doctor's visit.

So, I guess if you're gonna do it, make sure you have insurance, a photo ID, and a thermometer if it's relevant.

**Updated March 4, 2020**

Last night / early this morning, our chief medical officer Dr. Grant Tarling issued this Health Advisory Letter to guests and crew currently sailing onboard Grand Princess. A similar notification has been emailed to guests who sailed on the previous voyage. For guests who sailed on the previous Grand Princess voyage (Feb 11-21), if you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness with fever, chills, or cough since your return home, please immediately contact your medical provider. You can also [view the COVID-19 information card (PDF)](https://www.princess.com/news/pdfs/cdc-covid-19-info-card.pdf) provided by the CDC. **Guests Health Advisory – CoronavirusMarch 4, 2020**

Dear Princess Guest:

I wish to advise you that today we have been notified by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that they are investigating a small cluster of COVID-19 (coronavirus) cases in Northern California connected to our previous *Grand Princess* voyage that sailed roundtrip San Francisco from February 11 to February 21. We are working closely with our CDC partners and are following their recommendations.

For those guests who sailed with us on our previous voyage and may have been exposed, in an abundance of caution, the CDC requires you to remain in your stateroom until you have been contacted and cleared by our medical staff. A member of our medical team will be calling you between the hours of 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM this morning. You may order room service while you wait for the medical screening to be completed, and we apologize for any inconvenience.

Please be assured that the health, safety, and well-being of all guests and crew are our absolute priority. The CDC is continuing to actively collect information and has set up a meeting with us this morning to determine what, if any, actions need to be taken during this cruise and on arrival in San Francisco. We have shared essential travel and health data with the CDC to facilitate their standard notification to the State and County health authorities to follow up with individuals who may have been exposed to people who became ill.

As we anticipate that further review of the situation will be necessary on arrival in San Francisco, we will be cancelling the call to Ensenada on Thursday, March 5, in order to sail directly to San Francisco and arrive on Thursday afternoon. We will keep you updated with information as we finalize plans. To assist you in contacting your family, we are providing free internet and phone service. We will advise you if the need arises to make changes to your onward travel plans post-cruise.

COVID-19 causes mild illness in about 80% of cases, typically with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, like the common cold or flu. About 20% of people develop more severe symptoms. The more severe symptoms typically occur in more susceptible individuals that have higher risk factors, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions, as it does with regular flu. The illness is mainly spread by droplets from close person-to-person contact. It is possible for the virus to spread by hand touch surfaces, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Updated information on the illness can be found at the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/).

As with all respiratory illnesses, particularly during cold and flu season, you can take steps to reduce your risk of illness:

1. Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.
2. Supplement hand washing by regularly using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
3. Avoid close contact with people suffering from respiratory illness.
4. Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze using a tissue or your bent elbow.
5. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

We are closely recording and monitoring all persons who have reported to the medical center with cold and flu symptoms during the voyage. As a precaution, we are also conducting additional enhanced environmental disinfection onboard in addition to our regular stringent cleaning and sanitation protocols.

If you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness with fever, chills, or cough at any time during this cruise, and you have not already consulted with the medical staff, please immediately contact the Medical Center to report your illness. There will not be a charge for this service.

Thank you for taking the time to read this important information.

I thought Coronavirus is transmitted in plenty of ways including simply through the air.

Aren't all these measures you suggest similar to put out a forest fire with just a garden hose?

Like I'm actually asking, not trying to be a smartass, but isn't a whole stadium filled with people, breathing more or less ventilated, but still sort of self-contained air already massive recipe for disaster?

I understand the principle of putting at least some effort into trying to prevent further spread, but considering the way it spreads it just seems futile to me, would like to be educated on this."

The following excerpts are from the WHO link:  https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf


 The COVID-19 virus is unique among human coronaviruses in its combination of high transmissibility, substantial fatal outcomes in some high-risk groups, and ability to cause huge societal and economic disruption. 

Most people infected with COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately
80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes
non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease (dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours) and 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure).

Mortality increases with age, with the highest mortality among people over 80 years of age (CFR 21.9%). The CFR is higher among males compared to females (4.7% vs. 2.8%). By occupation, patients who reported being retirees had the highest CFR at 8.9%. While patients who reported no comorbid conditions had a CFR of 1.4%, patients with comorbid conditions had much higher rates: 13.2% for those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer.

Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told The Wall Street Journal that ""it's likely we'll see a global pandemic"" of coronavirus, with 40 to 70 percent of the world's population likely to be infected this year.  (CDC states 32M to 45M get the flu every year.  USA has 327 million people.  327,000,000 x .4=130 Million corona infections.) 

Prof Gabriel Leung, the chair of public health medicine at Hong Kong University, says if the transmission estimate of 2.5 additional people for each infected rate is accurate, that would result in an ""attack rate"" that would affect 60 to 80 percent of the world's population.


So....is Corona ""just like the flu""??  NO it's not."

“Chinese scientists found that the coronavirus causing COVID-19 has two mutations, S-cov and a more dangerous L-cov, that features higher transmissibility and inflicts more harm to the human respiratory system.”

“the L-cov was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan but declined in early January.”

Basically, it did mutate to be more aggressive, but that more aggressive strain became less common in early January (likely because people were more quickly identified as being sick and therefore isolated and the virus could not be transmitted on to as many people)."

No. Chinese health experts are confident that those fully recovered from the disease have immunity against reinfection at least for some time(at least for many months), but not permanently. This is supported by the fact that donated plasma from recovered patients has been shown to be extremely effective in tackling the virus in existing patients.

The current cases of ""reinfection"", which have been observed only a handful of times around the world, are most likely relapses of the same, original infection. Relapses can happen with influenza too.

There is absolutely NO reason to assume that getting infected with the Covid-19 later on, assuming that your immune system has recovered from the first infection, should be more serious than the first. that's just not how the physics work. Quite the opposite, it's likely that the hypothethical second infection is much less severe.

One of the alleged ""reinfection"" cases appeared in Israel. Shimon Dahan, a man who got infected with Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess, was treated and declared recovered in Japan 27th of February.

However, he has shown no symptoms in Israel and is expected to be declared recovered and released from hospital  today.

I struggle with coworkers saying the media is over-hyping the situation, while I'm wondering why an entire country would shut down their economy over a nothingburger. It seems surreal, like I'm the only one that gets it (along with the people on this sub). Dept of Defense says an imminent crisis is going to be happening within 30 days. Charts and graphs show that at one time China and SK were in the single digits and now are in the thousands. It seems to take about 1 month, maybe 2, before the real exponential growth shows up, and after that..?. And since we are only in our first weeks, it feels like business as usual to those around me. A consequence of too many news channels crying wolf in the past, perhaps.

Maybe they don't understand exponential growth. Maybe people will use hand sanitizer and mitigate the virus with good practices and it will stop spreading before it gets bad. And we'll all laugh at our 60 rolls of TP. Or not...

Does anyone have any data that helps show why, come middle of April, the world will be in a different scarier place or, conversely, something that shows me I'm a lunatic and need to calm down? 

From the [article](https://www.newsweek.com/coronavirus-department-defense-pandemic-30-days-1489876):

The warning came as part of Thursday's Joint Chief of Staff daily intelligence brief and, according to a document obtained by Newsweek, officials expect COVID-19 will ""likely"" become a global pandemic within the next 30 days.
Officials have expected global cases would spread. On Tuesday, the National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) raised the Risk of Pandemic warning. It went from WATCHCON 2, a probable crisis, to WATCHCON 1, an imminent crisis, due to sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China, according to a report summary obtained by Newsweek."

1. How much buzz can Trump, Barr, and the DOJ make about Burisma and Hunter Biden stuff and will it matter at all to anyone who isn't already deeply Republican? Don't forget that Russia hacked Burisma a couple months ago and might do another email drop during the campaign.

2. What impacts will coronavirus have? My intuition is that it will help Democrats in two ways and Republicans in one. If the virus hurts the economy, and if the Trump administration botches their response, both those things I anticipate will make people seek a more steady hand for President (i.e. Biden). However, if virus fears are still lingering around by November, it could depress turnout, especially in cities, which generally helps Republicans.

>As new coronavirus cases in China slowed in recent weeks, local governments in less-affected regions pushed companies and factories to return to work, typically by assigning concrete targets to district officials. Company insiders and local civil servants told Caixin that, under pressure to fulfill quotas they could not otherwise meet, they deftly cooked the books.

>Leaving lights and air conditioners on all day long in empty offices, turning on manufacturing equipment, faking staff rosters and even coaching factory workers to lie to inspectors are just some of the ways they helped manufacture flashy statistics on the resumption of business for local governments to report up the chain.

>Electricity consumption data has regularly been used as a proxy for the business resumption rate when reporting to Beijing, and to the public.

>The East China province of Zhejiang has been lauded as a prime example of the nation’s industrial recovery from the coronavirus outbreak by China’s top economic planner, which reported on Feb. 24 that its work resumption rate was more than 90%.

>Nevertheless, a civil servant in one district of the provincial capital, Hangzhou, told Caixin that from Saturday plants were instructed to leave their industrial equipment idling for the whole day, while offices were told to keep computers and air-conditioners running, when Beijing began checking the resumption rate by examining power consumption figures.

>Caixin has chosen not to name the district to protect the identity of the civil servant, who could face repercussions for revealing the information publicly. But reached by phone, one company insider in the district said they saw such directives in multiple corporate WeChat groups. Another said they received the order too, but their operations had already resumed two weeks prior, and its production lines were in normal operation by Feb. 29. Another executive said they were not informed of the electricity use target, and said they were running at about one-fifth of normal capacity, with only a small proportion of machines in use.

>Hangzhou’s target was for corporate electricity consumption that day to hit 75% of what it was on Jan. 8, and that it should return to at least 90% of that by March 10.

>The real resumption rate in one industrial park in Hangzhou over the weekend was 40%, the civil servant estimated, far below the 75% target.

>The district official pointed out China is further subsidizing electricity costs as a way to incentivize businesses to resume, and said many companies would rather waste a small amount of money on power than irritate local officials.

>Insiders told Caixin that in some cases, rather than giving companies direct targets, local governments assigned quotas to local district officials who were then directly responsible for meeting them. Those officials would regularly visit the companies, prodding them to resume production in the guise of expressing “care and support.” That pressure is likely what drove them to switch on their machines.

>Zhejiang Provincial Government Deputy Secretary-General Chen Guangsheng boasted to press on Feb. 24 that a segment of manufacturing plants in Zhejiang reported a work resumption rate of 98.6%, and service enterprises 95.6%. More than 99% of the coastal province’s companies with annual export value above $10 million had resumed business, the provincial leader said.

>A company in Wenzhou, a major commercial center in the same province, confirmed it had received a designated power consumption target equal to half of the level before the outbreak, and had been running its air conditioners all day long to meet the goal.

>Zhejiang is not the only place where the reality on the ground is said to deviate from government figures.

>In the small industrial city of Botou, some 230 kilometers (143 miles) south of Beijing, Caixin found factories reported by the local government to have reopened their doors had not in fact resumed production.

>The head of one told Caixin that despite reports up the chain, the local government’s unwillingness to risk an outbreak meant it had not actually restarted. “The local government still forbids factories to actually resume work,” the executive said. “We have returned to the offices, but production has not resumed at all.”

>He further said the Botou government asked him to falsely report the number of employees who had returned to work, and even went so far as to directly coach workers about how to lie if they received calls from inspectors.

>Prolonged suspension of production had led to the loss of technicians and business orders, he added, because some of the company’s peers in other parts of China had resumed manufacturing ahead of them.

>Replying to Caixin’s request for comment on Monday, the Botou government said at least 228 enterprises in the Botou area had resumed business, but some companies might have said they did not because while they were registered as having resumed, they may not have been prepared to immediately commence production. They said companies were permitted to resume normal business after reporting to the local government, but could only begin operation after officials confirmed virus control measures were in place.

>A source in a smaller enterprise in Botou told Caixin companies have been allowed to resume production after meeting certain virus containment requirements, but face the further logistical issues as many rural roads remain blocked. Without a way to get raw materials in and send products out, there’s not much point in businesses returning to production.

>Open data from Baidu Maps shows overall traffic flow inside the Botou city over the weekend was still less than half of the average last year, after two weeks of slow recovery starting from Feb. 18."

Their response with ""Let me comment on some of the recent progress we have made in the areas of sanitation and hygiene.  This week the custodial team has been instructed to focus on disinfecting surfaces, door knobs, elevator knobs, and other community surfaces.  We will be bringing in additional custodians to assist in the disinfecting efforts which includes restrooms.  Environmental Health and Safety has purchased hands free sanitizing stations that we will be placing in buildings across campus.  Currently the campus has 9 and we will be adding an additional 18.  We have also purchased disinfectant wipes for the computer labs/classes so students can wipe down keyboards."" 

They are not cancelling events, adequately cleaning the facilities, and they are spreading misinformation on how easily the virus spreads. A woman had the virus for 27 days before showing symptoms, and the virus can spread BEFORE the infected shows symptoms. 

They are too late to stop this from spreading on campus. In the next coming weeks we will definitely see cases beginning to pop up on campus."

I haven't gone all science on this, but I reckon it only takes a few panicked shoppers to buy out a store, even if most frequent shoppers there are just living their lives. It is in human nature, though, to react with much more heightened alarm to novel and unfamiliar threats (and this is called the novel coronavirus) than ones we're used to, like the flu and traffic accidents.

However, that is not to say that COVID-19 isn't a serious problem that we should all pay some attention to. It spreads somewhat easily, and has demonstrated a much higher fatality rate than the seasonal flu. The older someone is, the more vulnerable they are to it. And people with serious health problems may also be especially vulnerable to succumbing to it.

COVID-19 is also just getting around. Unlike the seasonal flu, there isn't a built-in amount of immunity to it in our population. So it may hit us harder and spread further.

Measures to contain it (necessary because we don't want our old and vulnerable to die prematurely!) may cause some amount of disruption to society, and already has in a lot of places. Although, I am willing to bet that, at least in New Jersey, those disruptions do not require anyone to keep a year's supply of toilet paper on hand.

He says it in the video but doesn't finish the math so it's clear and straightforward and easy to understand, so I hope this fills in the gaps.

He says seasonal flu has a mortality of 0.1%. COVID-19 has a mortality rate of 3 to 4%.

That's *30 to 40 times* more deadly than the seasonal flu.

In the US alone, we see about 12,000 to 61,000 deaths related to seasonal flu each year. If COVID-19 spreads just like the seasonal flu, we could see 360,000 to 1.8M deaths this year in the US.

Now a caveat is that the seasonal flu is very well studied, so we have a lot of epidemiological information on it. COVID-19 is very new, so any numbers related to it are tentative, and could change as more is learned.

The key takeaway is that we know what to expect from the flu. We do not with Coronavirus."

\> Director Changes

Danny Boyle was originally supposed to direct, but he left the production over a dispute regarding the script.  This happened before filming began, so it didn't really affect the filming too much.

\> Producer Changes

Not sure what this refers to.  The listed producers are Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, who have been involved with Bond movies for decades, and have produced them together since *Goldeneye* in 1995.

\> Rewrites

After Boyle left, the script was completely rewritten.  This isn't unusual, so it was to be expected.  Movies go through rewrites during filming all the time as a matter of course, so this probably didn't have a big impact on the production.

\> Daniel Craig Injury

Back in May, Daniel Craig hurt his ankle during filming and required surgery.  According to news outlets that covered it, he was only out 2 weeks for this, and filming continued in his absence.  It didn't put the film off-schedule.

\> On-Set Explosion

In June, a controlled explosion for special effects accidentally damaged the sound stage at Pinewood studios.  One crew member received minor injuries, and the set was damaged.

\> 'Camera-in-Bathroom' Incident

Also in June, a man was arrested for hiding a camera in a women's restroom on the Pinewood Studios lot.  The man in question was a maintenance worker for the studio, and wasn't involved with the production of the movie.

\> Coronavirus Delay

I don't really think this requires much of an explanation.  The film's release has been delayed from April to November.  MGM is saying it's due to  ""careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace.""  Movie theaters are one of the businesses that have been heavily affected by fear of infection due to the disease.  It's an economic decision that I expect some other big productions may also make in the coming weeks."

That would put us at 646,000 deaths as of this flu season, about as many deaths as were caused by heart disease in 2017; given that the flu season isn't over it would rise significantly from that. It would become the leading cause of death in the US by a large margin. And we don't have a vaccine for it yet like we do for the flu.

If we use the 2018-2019 flu season numbers (42,900,000 sick) with the coronavirus mortality rate (3.4%), that's 1,458,600 deaths. That's staggeringly large.

To put it another way - go play Russian Roulette, except you pick blindly from 5 revolvers. Only one has a bullet loaded, and it's only one bullet, but you still need to pick one, spin the cylinder, put it to your head, and pull the trigger. On average, you're 0.2% more likely to survive that than coronavirus.
