""Xi told local officials during a Feb 3 meeting of the Politburo‚Äôs Standing Committee that some of the actions taken to contain the virus are harming the economy, said two people familiar with the meeting, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.

The origin is very unlikely to be wild animal *consumption* itself, but rather live handling of said wild animals. In other words, the novel coronavirus may not have come from someone who ate a wild animal.

It also presents this information as known fact when there is still very much that we don't know (such as where it initially came from; the first known cases were not from the live seafood market, so the wild animal may have very possibly been from elsewhere).

This is quite reminiscent of how during the Ebola outbreak, people were claiming as fact that it came from Africans hunting and eating bats, when in reality it was a kid playing outside who came into contact with some bat droppings."

People may have symptoms but just stay home or are not sick enough to go to a hospital or the doctors may not test them for the new disease and just use basic treatment. As more of the general population is tested the true rate will become clear. Expect it to be similar to SARS or MERS.

If you are truly afraid of this outbreak, i suggest you go get your flu shot. It WON'T help with coronavirus, but there were 15 million cases and about 8,000 deaths from flu alone last year. And that is a disease you can actively protect yourself from but so many people choose not to."

I clearly showed you where they have been included.  The tax cuts are in the projections out to 2029-30.  The budget is projected to still be in surplus in 2029-30.  You said that it was uncosted, I have shown that it is costed and we are still projected to have a budget surplus.

>You sure about that surplus? Even the government has abandoned it after years of promises.

The trajectory of the budget is towards a surplus.  A couple of one-off events like the coronavirus and bushfires isn't going to fundamentally damage that trajectory."

I posted in this thread to reduce panic because people are eating this shit up.

&#x200B;

I'll say from my own first-hand experience though in China - it is scary. It is something to be afraid of and it is something people need to take seriously, people snickered and laughed when I was passed border patrol in New York because I was wearing a mask not knowing I just arrived from China - the same occurred when I went to Delta airlines in Terminal 2 for my connecting flight and when I landed in Tampa. People don't give a shit when they should and people laugh when they realize people wearing a mask could potentially be saving their life, or saving their parents life (it effects the elderly the worst) if they contract it and shake it off as the traditional flu. People aren't taking precaution when they should be, it's serious.

&#x200B;

People should be concerned and talking about, you should be taking in as much media as you can about it, you should know what's going on and whether or not it's going to effect you. The more informed you are the better, and if you fear it, then there's absolutely nothing wrong with that - you should fear it, it can kill you. I was on vacation in a ghost town which was in Jilin province for three weeks, I know first-hand what China is like right now, and let me tell you if it gets spread through America - we're fucked. No one wears masks here, no one cares and most of us won't give a shit until it truly effects us or someone in their lives. 

&#x200B;

The people who don't take this as important are the very same ones who think it can never happen to them, or they don't preventative measures, they only take action when it actually hits them. So yes, it **is as bad as this sub** paints it to be, take most of what you see with a grain of salt of course, ingest media, outline what you see and develop your own informed opinion. Some people spread misinformation and fear-mongering videos like the ones I posted without fact-checking - which is something this sub needs - a sticky at the top and more moderation to prevent fear-mongering videos, and when something is fact-checked we can then post it and have discussions being made regarding it. Right now it's an influx of misinformation and people who just want to benefit off the virus on Youtube/Social media. 

&#x200B;

But to note - The videos you see in China, I'd take those seriously. Except ones posted from a reliable source, ones that haven't been vetted. People can easily fabricate and doctor videos with fake speakers and people will do anything to make China look bad (I mean, we know it's bad and they're underreporting, and a lot is wrong that they're doing) so expect a lot of bullshit to come out, but most of those videos are more than real. It's real, it's scary."

Here's the story about our Dear Leader.

Feb 11 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping warned top officials last week that efforts to contain the new coronavirus had gone too far, threatening the country's economy, sources told Reuters, days before Beijing rolled out measures to soften the blow.

With growth at its slowest in nearly three decades, China's leaders seem eager to strike a balance between protecting an already-slowing economy and stamping out an epidemic that has killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 40,000.

After reviewing reports on the outbreak from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and other economic departments, Xi told local officials during a Feb 3 meeting of the Politburo's Standing Committee that some of the actions taken to contain the virus are harming the economy, said two people familiar with the meeting, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.

He urged them to refrain from ""more restrictive measures"", the two people said.

Local authorities outside Wuhan - where the virus is thought to have first taken hold - have shut down schools and factories, sealed off roads and railways, banned public events and even locked down residential compounds. Xi said some of those steps have not been practical and have sown fear among the public, they said.

China's state council information office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The official Xinhua News Agency, reporting on the Politburo meeting last Monday, called the coronavirus outbreak ""a major test of China's system and capacity for governance."" It added, without details, that ""party committees and governments of all levels were urged to achieve the targets of economic and social development this year.""

Since the meeting, China's central bank has vowed to step up support for the economy and prepared policy tools to offset the damage. The NDRC said at a weekend briefing that it was urging companies and factories to resume work, especially in ""key industries"" such as food and pharmaceuticals.

""In the context of the epidemic and the downward pressure on the economy, it is more important to maintain economic growth,"" Pan Gongsheng, vice-governor of China's central bank, said on Friday.

On Monday, Zhejiang province, an economic powerhouse in eastern China, ordered local authorities not to overreact by restricting everyday movement or shutting down ""shops of chain stores and convenience stores that sell daily necessities such as vegetables, cooking oil as well as meat, eggs and dairy products,"" according to a government release.

China has unveiled new tax policies as it tries to reduce the burden on industries hit heavily by the epidemic.

Reuters reported this month that policymakers in China are preparing measures, including more fiscal spending and interest rate cuts, amid expectations the outbreak will devastate first-quarter growth.

Many in China returned to work on Monday after the Lunar New Year holiday was effectively extended for about 10 days, but morning commutes were far less crowded than usual and numerous factories remained shut.

The ruling Communist Party's propaganda department last week ordered state media to focus on ""economic recovery"", according to a person with direct knowledge of the order, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.

China's official media has been trying to project calm. In a Monday editorial, the official People's Daily urged the public to deal with the epidemic with a ""positive mood"". (Editing by Gerry Doyle)"

They remain in quarantine together with 200-plus residents who were evacuated from the building in Tsing Yi district in the New Territories in the early hours.
The evacuation occurred after a 62-year-old woman became the second confirmed case in the building on Monday, after a 75-year-old man tested positive on Jan. 30. The two patients, currently receiving treatment, live on different floors.
Initial investigations into the drainage system in the building further reduced concerns that the virus may have spread through the pipes, authorities said.
The flat where the latest infection was discovered had had an alteration to its drainage system, but the pipe network in the public building was in good condition, they said.
Parts of Hong Kong, including restaurants, shopping malls and cafes, are almost deserted as people work from home and schools remain closed, evoking memories of 2003 when Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) sent panic across the city.
Most of Hong Kong‚Äôs population of more than 7 million people live in high-rise buildings. In 2003, initial exposure was blamed on high concentrations of the virus entering apartment bathrooms through floor drains in a complex called Amoy Gardens.

‚ÄúThe pipe design in the building is very good and even better than in many private properties, and it is definitely not the same situation as Amoy Garden,‚Äù Yuen Kwok-yung, chair of Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology at the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, told reporters.
SARS killed nearly 300 people in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam earlier on Tuesday appealed for residents to stay indoors as much as possible.
‚ÄúAs part and parcel of enhancing social distancing we are making an appeal to the people of Hong Kong to stay at home as much as possible,‚Äù Lam told reporters. ‚ÄúBut at the moment, we‚Äôre making this appeal, we‚Äôre not going for compulsory closures because Hong Kong is a free society.‚Äù
The government has confirmed 49 cases of coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,000 people, almost all in mainland China.

Embattled Lam is grappling with the health scare even as she faces broader tensions in Hong Kong society where months of often-violent anti-government protests paralysed parts of the global financial centre.

""So far this flu season, about 0.05% of people who caught the flu have died from the virus in the U.S., according to CDC data. 

The death rate for 2019-nCoV is still unclear, but it appears to be higher than that of the flu. Throughout the outbreak, the death rate for 2019-nCoV has been about 2%. Still, officials note that in the beginning of an outbreak, the initial cases that are identified ""skew to the severe,"" which may make the mortality rate seem higher than it is, Alex Azar, U.S. secretary of the Health and Human Services, said during a news briefing on Jan. 28. The mortality rate may drop as more mild cases are identified, Azar said. ""

""The measure scientists use to determine how easily a virus spreads is known as the ""basic reproduction number,"" or R0 (pronounced R-nought). This is an estimate of the average number of people who catch the virus from a single infected person, Live science previously reported. The flu has an R0 value of about 1.3, according to The New York Times.

Researchers are still working to determine the R0 for 2019-nCoV. A study published Jan. 29 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) estimated an R0 value for the new coronavirus to be 2.2, meaning each infected person has been spreading the virus to an average of 2.2 people.""

The coronavirus outbreak, however, is proving to be more deadly than the flu. It has killed roughly 2% of the people who have contracted it so far, according to world health officials. That compares with a mortality rate of 0.095% for the flu in the U.S., according to CDC estimates for the 2019-2020 flu season. The CDC estimates that 21 million people will eventually get the flu this season."

> Among the 840 patients in the study who underwent CT scans, only half showed ground-glass opacity and 46% showed bilateral patchy shadowing.

Title pretty much explains it. I'm an Asian-British university student. Stumbled upon the Twitter account of one of my classmates because another classmate who I follow retweeted him. Saw that his page was full of those shitty coronavirus memes about avoiding Asians on public transport and getting the local Chinese takeaway shut down and such. You've all seen the ones I mean. Said classmate is also a cockwomble of the highest order and I already don't like him anyway, fwiw. He hit on my (also Asian) friend in a really gross, ""be my waifu"" kinda way last year and then hurled some racial slurs when she turned him down and he just generally makes a lot of dodgy jokes all the time. 

So WIBTA if I intentionally sit next to him in class today and fake a coughing fit to fuck with him?

Currently in a 3rd world country so being a bit reclusive, I already have trouble fighting off the germs that my immune system hasn't dealt with before. So I will admit this one has been on my mind.

The US has the CDC, who has been on this outbreak since the beginning and done a great job with local health providers in isolating the cases that occurred in the US before they could spread beyond immediate family or roommates. Sometimes the system works, and I hope that it continues to work. I don't agree with the narrative that there are secretly thousands of Americans out there dying of Coronavirus but not going to the hospital. We live in an interconnected world where everything is posted on social media all over the place. If there were thousands of sick Americans sick with a mysterious illness then we would know about it. They aren't, much to the displeasure of a lot of people on this sub."

First, it is exactly the same as the Business Insider article.

Second, the post title is elaborated in the article:

* Men represent the majority of coronavirus cases so far, according to a new study

> Other recent studies have produced similar results. A study of 99 coronavirus patients at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital showed that the average patient was 55 1/2 years old, and men represented around 68% of the total cases. A third study of nearly 1,100 coronavirus patients (which is still awaiting peer review) identified a median age of 47, with men representing around 58% of all cases.

* Researchers have a few guesses as to why.

> In 2017, researchers at the University of Iowa set out to investigate why that was by infecting male and female mice with SARS. Mice studies don't necessarily have definitive implications for humans, but the researchers did find that male mice were more susceptible to the virus than female mice.

> The researchers at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital gave a similar explanation for why more of their coronavirus patients were men, suggesting that women may have a ""reduced susceptibility"" to viral infections. But they also said many patients with severe cases had chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Those particular illnesses tend to affect middle-age men more than middle-age women.

I understand there is no consensus for why more men than women are infected. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the post title is misleading (that is, not supported by the article). ‚ÄúGrain of salt‚Äù is the appropriate flair, not ‚ÄúMisleading Title‚Äù."

Most of the information said online seems very weak sources... it's not that we are denying the information but the sources on where they came from sounds very questionable.. 

They will say it's aerosol but not backed up with another evidence. in my opinion i think it's a measure Chinese have said this so they can easily ""contain"" anyone ""with the virus"". 

considering there is a lot of droplets on those possible areas where they are treating the patients, that it cause so many droplets in the air could it be caused by that to lead them to say it's airborne? there was no information about this. 

CDC did say that medical practitioners should be careful about aerosols. and that they should use caution when performing aerosol-generating procedures.

Orange is not an overreaction. It is a reaction that is just right.

The criteria for Orange is a severe disease that has local community spread with no known origin source.

Coronavirus has 7 out of our 45 patients in the ICU (15%). This means that it is a quite serious disease. We already have multiple cases of local community spread with no known origin, as seen from the school teacher, the Bangladeshi worker, and other cases. Coronavirus in Singapore therefore meets the criteria for Orange."

An epidemic of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is affecting mainland China, along with isolated cases in 27 other countries and territories. It was identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, after 41 people developed pneumonia without a clear cause. The virus, which causes 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, is capable of spreading from person to person. The incubation period (time from exposure to onset of symptoms) is generally 2 to 14 days, but it may be contagious during this period and after recovery.

Chinese fatality numbers are difficult to trust at the moment because we have no info on how many of those that died also died as a result of the facility they were admitted to not being properly equipped to deal with something like the coronavirus. Since the flu is prevalent, it's likely most of these facilities know how to deal with the flu. Whereas they were completely underequipped to deal with coronavirus. This won't be the same in the US. Also China is far more heavily crowded and far less hygienic in the cramped urban centers.

I think being on top of coronavirus is absolutely a necessity but fearmongering it as being more fatal than the flu is not that helpful. Flu kills tens of thousands of people every year in America. I think last year was like 60,000-70,000 dead.

If we're talking about pneumonia rate; I think that goes hand in hand with proper equipment but in this case it would be medication or nonpharm method of treatment."

Chinese health authorities clarified on Sunday that the transmission routes of the novel coronavirus via aerosol and oral-fecal are yet to be verified, reiterating that the main routes of the virus infection remain transmission via contact and direct transmission such as transmission via respiratory droplets.

The clarification was made public in a Sunday article posted by the National Health Commission (NHC) on its official Sina Weibo account after Zeng Qun, deputy head of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, said at a Saturday press conference that the novel coronavirus can transmit via aerosol.¬†

In the Sunday post, the NHC clarified that the aerosol transmission refers to the nucleus composed of proteins and pathogens that came out from the droplets upon evaporation, which further float in the air in the form of aerosol, possibly causing long-distance transport.

The NHC also said that normally, there would not be any novel coronavirus in the air if sufficiently ventilated, and also suggested that the public should open their windows at least twice a day as an effective measure to lower the chance of infection.¬†¬†

However, without enough ventilation, for example in narrow spaces such as the inside of a car or office, aerosol transmission should be also considered, said Yao Maosheng, a bioaerosol study expert and professor from the College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering of the Peking University in Beijing.¬†

Yao told the Global Times on Sunday that even breathing in viruses does not necessarily mean that one would surely get infected, as it would be determined by factors such as the number of live virus and the virus's own infection characteristics.¬†

The NHC stressed that the transmission of the virus via aerosol can only take place under certain conditions, such as in the professional medical operation process of tracheal intubation. It added that wearing masks in the correct way is one of the best measures to prevent ordinary people from getting infected by the virus. (Presuming n95 or rubber seal masks)

In open spaces, the chance of getting infected can be almost negligible, if not closely surrounded by an infected patient, Yao said, when asked to comment on the possibility of infection through aerosol transmission.

> There were no obvious links to previous cases, so the MOH handed the data to the police and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) took on the challenge.

The first death occured on March 25 when we only had about 40-50 cases. The second death, a pastor, occured the next day on March 26. Schools were closed on March 27. 

In my opinion, it was the panic and uncertainty after the first two deaths that truly led them to close schools, not ""widespread infections"". Otherwise, they would close schools now as well since there is evidence of local transmission and we have around the same number of cases of coronavirus as there were of SARS on March 27"

Yield curve inversions are negative because they often indicate the Fed has raised rates to a level that has caused demand to drop.  That hasn't happened.

My brother is currently in China, isolated in a remote village with his fianc√©e and family for a while to prevent them being affected by Coronavirus. He managed to get on Facebook (probably via a VPN) and put out a status to update others on how he's holding up.

Before I get into what his status contained, some context about me and my brother. I've found it really hard to get on well with him for the last few years. We keep up to date with what each other are doing, and my parents fight to keep that going, but I find some of his characteristics really annoying. Best way I can describe him without letting my own opinion chime in is he's ""dramatic"". Loves debating, politics, drama. Wants to add his opinion often, and completed a Law degree.

So, his status. I got irritated by the format of how it, in my own words, sounded ""like a (British) MP giving a statement to the press"". He'd written an entire paragraph starting with ""I would like to extend my condolences to anybody who has been affected by this awful outbreak"", and ending with how he, ""like many others, was particularly upset by the death"" of a doctor who passed away. To me, he was writing like he it was some public statement that was going to be critiqued, whereas he was posting it to his friends on Facebook. This isn't the first time he's posted stuff like that, but this is the first time I've responded back.

I decided to message him (privately) to tell him I couldn't understand why he would add the bit about sending condolences, and that he sounded like he was giving a public statement to the press, but whilst also saying the rest of his status was good and gave a good overview of how he is. His reaction was initially ""you're entitled to your opinion"", but then sunk pretty quickly into being angry with me that I just had to put him down. He's now taking some of my Twitter posts and trying to twist them in the same way. He's really hard to reason with at this point, so I'm kind of leaving it.

I'm finding it really hard to see where I'm being harsh. I've asked for advice from friends, but I want a more unbiased opinion. Should I have just kept my mouth shut? Am I being an asshole?

Chinese health authorities clarified on Sunday that the transmission routes of the novel coronavirus via aerosol and oral-fecal are yet to be verified, reiterating that the main routes of the virus infection remain transmission via contact and direct transmission such as transmission via respiratory droplets.

The clarification was made public in a Sunday article posted by the National Health Commission (NHC) on its official Sina Weibo account after Zeng Qun, deputy head of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, said at a Saturday press conference that the novel coronavirus can transmit via aerosol.¬†

In the Sunday post, the NHC clarified that the aerosol transmission refers to the nucleus composed of proteins and pathogens that came out from the droplets upon evaporation, which further float in the air in the form of aerosol, possibly causing long-distance transport.

The NHC also said that normally, there would not be any novel coronavirus in the air if sufficiently ventilated, and also suggested that the public should open their windows at least twice a day as an effective measure to lower the chance of infection.¬†¬†

However, without enough ventilation, for example in narrow spaces such as the inside of a car or office, aerosol transmission should be also considered, said Yao Maosheng, a bioaerosol study expert and professor from the College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering of the Peking University in Beijing.¬†

Yao told the Global Times on Sunday that even breathing in viruses does not necessarily mean that one would surely get infected, as it would be determined by factors such as the number of live virus and the virus's own infection characteristics.¬†

The NHC stressed that the transmission of the virus via aerosol can only take place under certain conditions, such as in the professional medical operation process of tracheal intubation. It added that wearing masks in the correct way is one of the best measures to prevent ordinary people from getting infected by the virus. (Presuming n95 or rubber seal masks)

In open spaces, the chance of getting infected can be almost negligible, if not closely surrounded by an infected patient, Yao said, when asked to comment on the possibility of infection through aerosol transmission.

Secondly whether the news will admit it or not, nCoV IS a bio-weapon. The US expert on bio-weapons Dr. Francis Boyle already said publically it is a bio-weapon he also said the World Health Organisation knows that. This confirms what virologists in India research lab published before they were forced to withdraw it. Their research found at least 4 genetic inserts in nCoV. The genetic code of those inserts matched 100% segments of HIV-1 virus. It is impossible that a coronavirus, by random chance created these exact replications of genetic code of HIV-1.

>No need to get stupid about it quite yet  
  
*If* the time comes to ""get stupid"" about it, it will be too late to do so.  
  
The US is doing a good job of quarantining suspected infections, but we are doing a terrible job at letting people come back from China.  We are way past the limited to Wuhan stage.   5 million people left Wuhan for other parts of China before they shut it down, and the virus has been out there since at least Dec 2019.  Every province in China has infections and many big tech companies, including Google are working to actively suppress information on the Coronavirus and make sure people only see the ""official"" information.   Curating the truth, so people get the positive version of what is happening.  

""WHO is also battling misinformation, working with Google to ensure that people get facts from the U.N. health agency first when they search for information about the virus. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Tencent and TikTok have also taken steps to limit the spread of misinformation and rumors about the outbreak""  
  
Kind of like the way Google, YouTube, Twitter and others limit the spread of information about Antifa, Biden, Trump rallies and everything else.  If you've been a Pede for more than six months, you already know Google, China and CNN are about equal in terms of fake news and lies.      
  
On the plus side, President Trump has been trustworthy.  Given how much the market is on edge,  if POTUS starts taking further measures, then we will know it is far worse than we are being told.

Obviously throwaway. I am working in a company in an area infected with Coronavirus(you can probably guess where, but don't ask). There has been a shortage of masks and it is very hard to buy it in stores, only online where the price goes up to 10 times or more of the original price. 


You see, the company keeps its stock of surgical masks, many cartons of it, in the warehouse. We were told that they are only given to the workers who work in high risk areas and we could only get it if our supervisors request it personal and get approved. 


So here is it... I just saw a coworker of mine sneaking one box of the masks under her clothes and into her personal bag. I confronted her about it and she pleaded with me to pretend I didn't see it. She claimed that her family needed the masks and she had very young children in the house. Well, the virus does spread fear around as the number of infected and death increases every day.


I am considering reporting her anyway... it may put the other person(who keeps count of the masks) in trouble. Plus, it was the company's property and stealing should be reported. However, a part of me says that I should just let it go. It really had nothing to do with me(won't get me in any trouble if I don't report) and the woman got to keep her family a little safer from the spreading virus. Plus, there were a whole dozens of cartons of them in the warehouse.


WIBTA if I report her?

Here's the article:

> SINGAPORE, Dengue infections are rising, even as Singapore is battling to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
> 
> And they are expected to go up even further, said the National Environment Agency, as there may be a switch in dominant serotype - something which usually precedes an outbreak.
> 
> This is because fewer people would have been infected, resulting in low herd immunity in the population, and hence higher rates of transmission.
> 
> This time, if a switch does occur, it may presage a big outbreak, as the rising mosquito-transmitted virus type DenV-3 has not been dominant here, at least for the past 30 years.
> 
> The switches have always been between DenV-1 and DenV-2.
> 
> There were 400 dengue infections last week, up from 371 in the previous week. There were another 63 between Sunday and 3pm on Monday (Feb 10).
> 
> The weekly cases had been rising steadily since mid-December, peaking at 404 cases in mid-January. It dropped the following week, but is again on the upswing.
> 
> The number of dengue infections this year has ranged between 303 and 404 a week.
> 
> The 1,723 cases in the first five weeks of the year is 60 per cent higher than the 1,057 infections diagnosed over the same period for last year, when Singapore saw the third-highest annual rate of dengue infections which resulted in 20 deaths.
> 
> These latest weekly figures are also the highest rates seen in the early part of the year, since 2016.
> 
> The NEA said on its dengue website: ""The high Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the community, current high number of dengue cases, and increase in circulation of DenV-3 serotype, could lead to weekly dengue cases rising above current levels in 2020.""
> 
> DenV-3 infections have been rising over the past three months.
> 
> The NEA told The Straits Times that while it is still too early to say there has been a switch of dominant dengue virus type, there have been more infections by DenV-3 than DenV-2, which has been dominant since 2016.
> 
> The spokesman added: ""The monthly proportion of DenV-3 cases in January was approximately 47 per cent, higher than the proportion of DenV-2 cases at 39 per cent.""
> 
> She said this means that a larger proportion of the population is now susceptible to dengue.
> 
> ""The rise in proportion of DenNV-3 cases is of concern, because DenV-1 and DenV-2 have been the predominant circulating serotypes in Singapore in previous years,"" she added.
> 
> The NEA said there are now 114 active dengue clusters with large clusters at Begonia Drive (166 cases), Gangsa Road (96 cases), Jalan Kembangan (85 cases), Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 (67 cases) and Jurong West Street 91 (57 cases).
> 
> There are 23 ""red"" clusters where more than 10 people have been infected. Cases are linked if the onset of symptoms are within 14 days, the maximum incubation period, and their homes or workplaces are located within 150m of each other.
> 
> The NEA said: ""Concerted community action and sustained mosquito control efforts are thus needed to prevent further escalation of the Aedes aegypti mosquito population, and an increase in the number of people becoming ill with dengue."" Related StorySingapore faces dengue threat from emergence of little-seen strain
> 
> Last year, 20 people died of dengue. There have been no deaths this year.

I am interested in your view on this video.  It is a conversation with a crematorium worker in Wuhan.  The part near the end where they say one-third of the bodies are from the hospital while two-thirds of the bodies are from the homes is very concerning to me. 

 They say there are 4 to 5 times as many bodies as normal. Since Wuhan normally has an average of 200 bodies a day, this means there are 800 to a thousand extra deaths everyday right now just in Wuhan.

I recognize that you are handling your fear and concerns by ridiculing and cutting down other people's concerns. However, for your safety and for your family's safety you need to start paying attention. A pandemic is a very serious situation and this one shows no signs of slowing down.

Flutrackers.com has some good information on preparation. I really wish you would take a good look at it and read about some of the history of pandemics. ""The Great Influenza"" by John Barry is a good book.  Safe travels to you."

The China National Tobacco Corporation (‰∏≠ÂõΩÁÉüËçâÊÄªÂÖ¨Âè∏ Zh≈çnggu√≥ YƒÅnc«éo Z«íngg≈çngsƒ´) is by sales the largest single manufacturer of tobacco products in the world and boasts a monopoly in Mainland China generating between 7 and 10% of government revenue.

Tobacco control legislation does exist, but public enforcement is rare to non-existent outside the most highly internationalized cities, such as Shanghai and Beijing.

> With growth at its slowest in nearly three decades, China&#039;s leaders seem eager to strike a balance between protecting an already-slowing economy and stamping out an epidemic that has killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 40,000.

> After reviewing reports on the outbreak from the National Development and Reform Commission and other economic departments, Xi told local officials during a Feb 3 meeting of the Politburo&#039;s Standing Committee that some of the actions taken to contain the virus are harming the economy, said two people familiar with the meeting, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Coronavirus

Last September I put ""there will always be unforeseen developments in manufacturing and logistics that are beyond our control""  into the Risks and Challenges section of the Kickstarter page; little did I know what that would entail.

The Chinese government extended the Chinese New Year break for an extra week to establish prevention and identification protocols for coronavirus, and they are permitting factories to reopen today, Monday February 10. Panda Games has made the decision to push back the start of production by one more week to take extra measures to protect their workers and reduce the chance of an outbreak at the Panda factory. The new date to resume factory operations is tentatively Monday February 17. 

This is not a minor undertaking.

During the week of Feb 10 to 17, Panda will be asking workers to isolate and quarantine themselves at home or in their dorm rooms. Their health will be monitored and their temperature will be checked twice a day. If any of them show signs of fever or symptoms of the coronavirus, they‚Äôll be sent to the hospital. If there are no signs of coronavirus in any of their workers after a week, then it is likely that they are healthy and Panda will resume operations next week on Monday February 17.

The impact on this project's schedule will be a domino effect. Those who follow Kickstarters closely know that the Chinese New Year looms large in the mind of every developer; either you push hard to get production well underway before the CNY or you queue up with all the projects waiting for the end of the holiday and get busy as soon as everyone returns. To lose two weeks of production creates a larger backlog and pushes back everyone by more than two weeks. However, I applaud Panda's caution to ensure the safety of their people and that production resumes without interruption; I have a lot of confidence in this organization.

Before the coronavirus outbreak, I had some optimism that my Southeast Asia backers would start getting their games in mid-April with the ROTW following right behind. Now, I have trouble predicting the impact of this delay; I am circling the end of May on my calendar...a reasonable guess, but still a guess. I will update as I learn more."

Even if only for studying it, health officials will not let people with confirmed cases waltz freely about."

Likewise major cities in America also face this like NYC. The sewer system will be one of the things that spread coronavirus more along with hotel, apartment, and public restroom toilet plumes and all the fomites (sinks, handles or push plates on public restrooms and doors, menus in restaurants, the tabletop touch screen credit card/game machines at restaurants, credit card terminals (since people don't wash their hands properly). This doesn't include the jet hand dryers in bathrooms that aerosolize viruses and bacteria and blow them over 10 ft. from the unit. The HVAC or venting systems in buildings may not have HEPA filters (who knows if the makeshift hospitals that have been setup in China have HEPA filters) If a cluster develops in a nearby building around one of the makeshift hospitals that could be telling. 

Also take into account that a patient may not show symptoms for 14 days and then it is about 8-10 days until they show severe symptoms that would require seeking immediate medical attention During this time the virus is replicating and shedding. This means they can be potentially spreading the virus for up to 24 days before they are hospitalized. The 24 dday incubation period was confirmed yesterday.

**SARS and NCoV-2019 bind to protein receptors in the lungs and intestines (ACE2)**  
""SARS and Wuhan viruses bind to the same distinctly shaped [protein receptors](https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/early/2020/01/23/JVI.00127-20.full.pdf) in the body that are expressed in the lungs and intestines, making these organs the primary targets for both viruses, said Fang Li, an associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at the University of Minnesota.""

That has led to a run on face masks. But those may be of limited benefit in the event the virus is being transmitted via the fecal-oral route, said John Nicholls, a clinical professor of pathology at the University of Hong Kong.

Squat latrines lacking covers, common in China, and hands that aren‚Äôt washed thoroughly with soap and water after visiting the bathroom could be a source of virus transmission, said Nicholls, who was part of the research team that isolated and characterized the SARS virus.

‚ÄúI think in Wuhan, that would be a very likely place where you might get the transmission‚Äù from fecal material, he said. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs using the same receptor as for SARS, I can‚Äôt see why it shouldn‚Äôt be replicating in the gut.‚Äù

Doctors have reported diarrhea infrequently in 2019-nCoV patients admitted to **Wuhan hospitals**, though it has been **more prominent among reported cases outside the city, including members of a Shenzhen family infected in Wuhan, and more recently in the first U.S. case in Washington state.**

Many of the emerging coronaviruses are so-called pneumoenteric viruses, meaning they can **replicate both in the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal system,** said Ralph Baric, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has studied coronaviruses for decades.

**Overwhelmed by hundreds of severely sick pneumonia patients, doctors in Wuhan might not have focused on any gastric signs**, Baric said in a phone interview.

‚ÄúThe Chinese are so overwhelmed at the moment and trying to do a combination of treating patients and dealing with the scope of the outbreak, and then trying to get out papers that describe what‚Äôs happening,‚Äù he said.

**Any virus in stool is more likely to be present during the acute phase of an infection, occurring before hospitalized patients develop a life-threatening complication known as acute respiratory distress syndrome,** Baric said.

‚ÄúI have also spent most of my time focusing on the respiratory tract symptomology rather than the gut because of the relationship between these different emerging viruses and acute respiratory distress syndrome,‚Äù he said.

Zijian Feng, deputy director general of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and colleagues released a report Wednesday on the first 425 Wuhan cases, and noted that **early infections that didn‚Äôt appear to display typical signs ‚Äî such as fever and viral pneumonia ‚Äî or had mild symptoms might have been missed.**

‚ÄúThe initial focus of case detection was on patients with pneumonia, but we now understand that some patients can present with gastrointestinal symptoms,‚Äù Feng and co-authors said in their report, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.‚Äù

I'm not sure who you are speaking about specifically. My original post introduced Americans of Korean heritage as a hypothetical. 

I'll re-state my point in simpler words: If one is going to feel pride based on race or ethnicity across country borders rather than national origin and upbringing, one can't selectively take credit for the best of both worlds.

Possibly because you're not informed? Possibly because you haven't done any research and you're dismissing sources of information that don't fit your narrative?

The knee-jerk reaction to the amount of information is impressive within the subreddits dedicated to coronavirus. Each new study is greeted with nigh on evangelical hysteria. Organisations, governments and experts have a more measured approach to ensure they get the full picture. And despite the cries of conspiracy and misinformation much of the processes that guide these deliberations are freely available on the web and have been for decades.

Many governments, national and State - not so much local - have had pandemic plans or emergency plans covering pandemics since the early 2000s, a lot of them started after SARS. You can freely trace their history and development. You can measure the performance of agencies against them and you can get a sense of what will come next in the response.

There were reasons why flights weren't immediately stopped to and from China, reasons not based on emotion and fear but on evidence and epidemiological evidence used in the current outbreak. One of the initial posts I made I provided a bunch of freely available links for someone to read and yet there's no indication they did. This seems to be a pattern of not reading or crediting info that doesn't fit someone's narrative.

I live and work in Singapore. Been a Doomsday Prepper/Post-Apocalypse fan since pre-teen. Always dreamt of being a prepper but don't have the resources.

With a bit of luck, I can comfortable say that I am prepared for what's been going on here. Thanks to my family visiting during Christmas (mom bought 2 boxes of biscuits, canned goods and other essentials from back home), been ordering sanitary pads in bulk online coz it's cheaper, had a habit of buying toiletries and cleaning supplies to last months as I'm lazy to keep doing groceries as I live alone, and been cooking more lately so I have pasta, fish, chicken, and meat in the fridge, even ice cream before shit hit the fan here. Then thanks to my OCD, I always have Isopropyl alcohol stocked which I use as sanitizer (never liked gel sanitizers and I feel that alcohol is safer since it's what's used in hospitals). I was ahead by only a week or so before the panic buying started.

Didn't get that much luck with face masks as I only started to buy week 1 of the coronavirus news so only managed to get 20 N95 masks, 200pcs of 1-ply paper mask (was all I could get at the first day after Chinese New Year), 1 cloth mask, 1 pitta mask, and thankfully a box of 50pcs of surgical mask which just arrived recently. Since my boss gave me 3 day work from home shifts, I only need to go to work for 2 days every week until things get better.

Will be checking your list and I think will be adding some essentials to my stock.

The funny thing here is people are prioritising toilet paper and instant noodles. Queueing for masks, santizers (which most of the ones in the market now are low quality ones, higher quality ones are 10x more expensive than usual). There are some buggers who bought those tiny alcohol prep pads that diabetics use for their insulin shots. It's laughable at best."

 Let's say we got a good 50-55% of the population to start protesting. Everything stops for a day. After that, everything kicks back up and no one speaks of it again. The media moves on to something else, ""It's not a big deal"". People would have to protest for weeks, even months like they did in China. Which makes the Coronavirus all the more of a coincidence but, I digress (*Always wanted to say that* üòé).

These days the political structure is overly complex, unbalanced and, seems as though the only real way to get anything done is to cheat at the game or hit the bigwigs where it hurts (*their wallets, of course*). A real protest would have to shut down the system temporarily. In order to do that it would have to be weeks or months even. Media would logically tell all the people who already conform and have no need to protest that ""it's not as bad as it seems"" hoping it for it to die out. With that mindset people will still go to work. Google Maps may even reroute them. So they don't see the protests.

 Other news organizations will eat it up for their own benefit. Eventually people who protest may even be deemed as domestic terrorists or just basically demonized to some degree. Police will be told what they will be told so they will serve unquestioningly like they do now and have always done. Those who do not conform will be banished from their groups (*fired/ridiculed*). I hate to say it, but martial law may even have to come into effect for them to understand. I'm using the whole Nameless Overlords ""they"" thing but, they're not going to want to give it up.

The only year that saw more was 2009, at the height of the global financial crisis.

****

>And now businesses are showing signs of being under similar pressure. **Insolvencies filed by businesses grew by 2.8 per cent, the first time the number of insolvent businesses grew in Canada since 2001**, during the dot-com bust.

****

>Ordinarily, **when insolvencies ‚Äï meaning bankruptcies and proposals ‚Äï are on the rise, it‚Äôs because of economic weakness**. Consumers find themselves **in trouble when the unemployment rate is rising and asset prices (stocks, real estate etc.) are falling.**

****

>But Canada **churned out an impressive 320,000 jobs in 2019, and stock markets soared to record highs. So what gives?** 

>The answer is debt ‚Äï more of it than ever before, and growing faster than in other countries.

****

>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs different than any other time before is interest rates,‚Äù said Andre Bolduc, executive director at the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals (CAIRP).

>‚ÄúAfter the financial crisis in 2009, **governments flooded their respective economies with money, interest rates went down to keep things moving, to keep the economy going**.‚Äù

****

>For a while, it worked. ‚ÄúOne would argue that **consumer spending is what kept the economy going after the financial crisis**,‚Äù Bolduc said in an interview with HuffPost Canada. ‚ÄúBut **because money was so cheap, people racked up a lot of debt.**‚Äù

****

>Businesses also borrowed, and many are now feeling the pinch, **particularly in the oil patch, where the slump led to a 75-per-cent jump in insolvencies in 2019**. 

****

>But **wholesale, information and cultural industries, professional and scientific services, education and manufacturing businesses also saw large spikes**. Despite the constant reports of store closures, **retailers actually saw a six-per-cent decline in insolvencies in 2019.**

****

>‚ÄúAll sectors have **gorged themselves on credit since interest rates were cut during and after the 2008-2009 Great Financial Crisis**,‚Äù the Macdonald-Laurier Institute said in a report released last month. ‚Äú**Households, corporations, and governments each have raised their debt load to about 100 per cent of GDP.**‚Äù

****

>Although **cheap credit has been a temptation** in most developed countries, Canadians have given into that temptation more than others. **Debt, as a share of Canada‚Äôs economic output, has risen by 32.5 per cent since the financial crisis, compared to an average of 13.8 per cent in other developed economies.**

****

>Perhaps ironically, our high debt levels may actually be because **Canada did relatively well during the last financial crisis, and consumers didn‚Äôt have to cut back.**

****

>‚ÄúMost other countries, notably **the U.S. and most EU nations, cut back on borrowing for several years during and after the Great Financial Crisis**. As a result, **the recent increase in debt in most countries started from a lower level than in Canada**,‚Äù the Macdonald-Laurier report noted.

****

>Canadians are now so vulnerable that **a series of small interest rate hikes at the Bank of Canada in 2017 and 2018 is largely responsible for this increase in insolvencies**, Bolduc said.

>‚ÄúWe know that **when the interest rate increases, the insolvency rate increases but there is a two to three-year lag**,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúOne of the reasons is that **a lot of people struggle with debt for years before they seek financial help**.‚Äù

****

>But Bolduc doesn‚Äôt think the situation looks like it would if this were a full-blown economic crisis. **When a real crisis hits, full-on consumer bankruptcies soar**. 

>...in 2009, they **jumped by 50 per cent in the space of nine months**. 

>But **consumer bankruptcies haven‚Äôt spiked ‚Äï in fact, they were down by 1.2 per cent. Instead, there was a 17.9-per-cent jump in less extreme consumer proposals.**

****

>That means **Canadians aren‚Äôt losing everything ‚Äï they‚Äôre simply struggling to cover their debts and need more breathing room**, Bolduc says.

****

>But **if the economy did actually slow down** ‚Äï something Finance Minister Bill Morneau said **this week could be the case, given the impact of the novel coronavirus** ‚Äï then **‚Äúconsumers could be in for an additional challenge**,‚Äù Bolduc noted."

The novel coronavirus has killed over 1,000 and infected about 42,000. That is a lethality rate of about 2.4%

What we do know - and this has been widely reported by mainstream media -  is that the epidemic in China is larger than the number of confirmed cases, and the number of deaths larger than the number of deaths stated.  

This does \_not\_ imply that the \_case-fatality rate\_ is far higher than reported. Our best estimates of that are now coming, and will come, from cases identified outside China. What we can already tell is that catastrophic doomsday alarmist estimates of high CFR appear to be wrong.  

Note that I am saying that everyone agrees that the epidemic in China is larger than the figures for confirmed cases; that the number of deaths caused by the virus is larger too.  This does \_not\_ imply that the disease is deadlier than reported - it only implies that more people were sick. 

The screengrabs of SO2 are dubious ([windy.com](https://windy.com) is a forecast site), and even if it existed, we do not know that it came from burning organic matter.  (Coal is among many other possible sources...)  Linking to a 4chan conspiracy theory really is not credible. 

Even if the epidemic has become larger in China than has been reported, there is no indication that this would cause a global financial panic or indeed panic of populations. Note that the stockmarket is at record highs. Since stock analysts and hedge funds have better access to information than readers of this subreddit,  it seems unlikely that knowledge of a larger epidemic in China would lead to a global financial panic, or any panic among the population. 

Coronavirus is one of the leading stories on all major news services in Europe (I cannot speak for local news in the US).  

China is likely to be understating the size of the epidemic it is experiencing, by stating only the numbers of confirmed cases. It has been open and explicit that it is doing this. That's all. 

Apart from this, there is no evidence of any global cover-up."

The 24 days is just one case out of tens of thousands. *It can get up to 24 days*, but most of the time it is way earlier.

And of course the WHO looks to act ‚Äúslowly‚Äù. This is a new virus that spreads really quickly. We just had our first case outside of China just over a month ago. And now it already infects 40K people. It takes time to asses a problem, especially when many of those problems have many unknown variable. The numbers and details of this virus are changing everyday. People used to be afraid that the incubation period is on average 2 weeks. Now we learn it tends to be much earlier. We recently learn that the fatality rate of this disease is 2 - 3%, which is relatively consistent. The % is much lower when you only account for the affected outside of China (out of hundreds of cases, only 1 deaths so far and some people are starting to recover)

This virus is much deadlier than influenza or h1n1 (2-3% coronavirus vs. 0.02% for h1n1) and it kills moslty those with weak immune systems and elderlies. At the same time, SARS fatality rate is around 10%. but do you know what can make this worse? Panic. Conspiracy theory. Hyperbole statements without evidences.

Indonesia may or may not have covid-19. We might be lucky, we might be not. What‚Äôs important is to be vigilant and take care of yourself and get yourself checked l if you have any of the main symptoms."

What you're advocating is a mass dieoff, because that's what would happen if the economy collapsed to the point where supply chains failed.

Lets assume that happens.  Shipping, both vehicular, naval and air travel grinds to a halt.  Large scale activity grinds to a near halt.  The aerosol masking effect clears, and temperatures rise by 2 degrees virtually overnight.

What will happen next?  Conflict.  Over whatever resources are obtainable and required to sustain whatever populace (not necessarily a nation-state) has the means to take them.

Medicine: I've purchased a lot of antibiotics for my 'fish' from walmartpetrx. I know what amoxicillin smells like, and the pills are all from the same company that provide it for humans. The only difference is packaging.

100x500mg Amox is $26 - Good for bacterial lung infections, plus I know I'm not allergic to it vs other antibiotics. Secondary infections have been a leading cause of death for coronavirus.

30x250mg Aephalexin is $12 - Good for tissue infections.

250x600mg NAC - $16 - 'Suppliment' that's been shown to help reduce oxidative damage/stress. It's available over the counter. It's an antioxidant that actually has clinical use. It's given to people who overdose on tylenol to prevent damage...lets see someone use blueberries to do that. It also functions as a mucolytic, may reduce virus' ability to reproduce, has multiple studies showing it helps lungs for people suffering from asthma/COPD, reduces Flu and Avian flu duration and severity.  May not do anything for corona virus, but it helps with the flu and I've spent money on worse.

$700 for grid bypass circuit breaker, can flip a switch and run all of the house off of generator. We had chronic power outages so this was more of a frustration buy years ago. Because we were tired of losing power every month for 2 to 10 hours.

$800 for 7200W/9500W generator with 240V/30A connection. If you are thinking about buying a generator, BUY ONE NOW. The markup on them is crazy when there's demand. Easily enough to power everything but HVAC unit. Technically 7200W is enough to handle HVAC + surge, but then I'd have to worry about balancing everything else.

It still has a lot of time left in the season and containment clearly isn't really working. 

It only takes that one healthy person to run around thinking they just have a normal common cold to spread it all over the place and because it's highly infectious it will have a tendency to stay in circulation once it's established in enough hosts. At that point I don't see how in the world you would keep it from eventually breaking out into Asia eventually, especially since it mimics the common cold. It can hide in plain sight and act similar to a common cold but then randomly kill people or give them lung damage and reinfect them on a regular basis, like the common cold.

It's all stuff you can mitigate with things like more hygiene but having a new common cold that kills people isn't good news."

this is apparently a malfunctioning kiosk. so inheritors are trying desperately to take advantage of the fact that nothing is perfect to convince people that the public transportation is a failure. 

the airline and automotive industry is set for their biggest lost due to the coronavirus scare. due to the fact that so many inheritors rely on the profit margin for these businesses, this makes it very difficult for these industries to adjust. so they will not have the time to sabotage efforts to take back freight lines and convert them back to working public train lines.

2020-02-11,BroThatsPrettyCringe,worldnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/eyq5vp/live_thread_wuhan_coronavirus/fhb4ghh/,">On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness in persons associated with the Hunan seafood and animal market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China. On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (*1*). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,\* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (*2*).  

From the CDC link.

I'm not going to dig through the thread, but a big part of why that formula doesn't work is because it ignores the time frame it takes to recover vs the time frame it takes to die. Death, when it occurs, happens around a week, maybe two, after showing symptoms. A full recovery takes much longer. So those who are fully recovering right now contracted the illness weeks before those who are dying right now, when the pool of those infected was much smaller. When going on a case by case basis, the rate of severe illness has been estimated to be between 13-20% consistently, and the mortality rate has hovered around 2%.

Also worth noting, both of our calculations use China's numbers so there is some due skepticism.

Also worth noting, the mortality rate outside of Asia is 0% thus far. Very possible that the mortality rate is further skewed by Wuhan's overwhelmed healthcare system."

2020-02-11,heyyouparkit,coys,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/f26p10/dele_alli_may_face_1_game_ban_over_video_he_posted/fhb749b/,"Was Dele‚Äôs actions racist? Well, not in the explicit sense where he called some random East Asian person a racial slur. We can debate forever on here whether it was or not, but the video was concerning to me because he is enabling this behavior against people from East Asia when it shouldn't be at all.

I‚Äôm a Korean-born US citizen living in New Hampshire. I never stepped foot onto the eastern side of the world (let alone China or Wuhan). An incident that happened to me last Friday when I was visiting a friend in Boston. I was taking the T  (slang name of the Boston subway system for those unaware) from the bus station. When I got on, I caught the eyes of a couple who took one look at me, looked at each other in a concerning fashion, and proceeded to move to the other side of the train car. Now, I get it that it could have been something else and totally irrelevant to me. Maybe the couple saw something behind me that made them move. I will never know. However, this came a few days after Boston had its first confirmed case of the coronavirus last Tuesday. Being aware of this, I can‚Äôt help but think that the couple thought I could get them sick, even though I've never stepped foot anywhere even remotely close to East Asia. When these types of incidents happen to you, it's dehumanizing, simply because I look like people from a country where this virus originated.

That, to me, is what frustrates me about the video. It‚Äôs not Dele himself I‚Äôm mad at. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a good guy with no ill will or intentions towards the East Asian man sitting at the airport or East Asian people in general. I‚Äôm just frustrated that he is potentially enabling others to act the same when they see a random East Asian guy on a train, an airport, a coffee shop, etc. I‚Äôve been read [article](https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/santa-cecilia-bans-oriental-students-coronavirus/) after [article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/09/chinese-in-uk-report-shocking-levels-of-racism-after-coronavirus-outbreak) about racism against Asians ever since the coronavirus reached outside China, including what [South Korea](https://twitter.com/Kakapolka/status/1222451845534060544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1222451845534060544&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fstory%2Fno-chinese-allowed-racism-and-fear-are-now-spreading-along-with-the-coronavirus-2020-01-29) is doing to its Chinese customers in Seoul. Seeing that behavior from Dele, let alone in person, makes you feel less than human and takes away your dignity and integrity as a person, let alone being part of a minority ethnic group in a country where you‚Äôre just trying to live your life and mind your own business.

Look, to be fair, I understand the fear. I will be the first one to say that I don‚Äôt have an ounce of trust in the Chinese government and the numbers they are reporting to us. I believe the numbers are FAR higher than what we know.

At the end of the day, it is a virus that is killing people, killing loved ones, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, etc. It‚Äôs being spread through human to human contact. As a result, people who never ate questionable animal meat in their entire life will get sick. At the end of the day, all of this is a tragedy, and I think we should treat it as such.

All I‚Äôm saying is be respectful to East Asian people. It‚Äôs enough that Chinese families is dealing with this. It‚Äôs enough that racism against us is never taken as seriously as racism against other ethnic groups. We as a people are dealing with enough shit already. Please don't contribute to it, and call out undeniable disrespect or rude behavior, as it feels like nobody in the world is standing up for us.

I got a call from a longtime friend (inventor of CoughZero), son of a scientist who grew up with a full lab at his disposal, who said he was trying to make some really strong CoughZero and accidentally created a way to stop people from dying from the Coronavirus.  

He named it CoronaZero and is asking me to help him make it fly.  I want to do the trials, but I'm a filmmaker, not a scientist.  I'm talking to r/conspiracy because I feel like there is an astounding nerve fully pumping with intelligence and a desire to figure things out.

Part of me believes the Coronavirus is a biological weapon.  Majority of me thinks that actually.

Regardless, if you inhale the CoronaZero vapor (I haven't tried it yet) it cures upper respiratory inflammation, which in turn keeps you alive so that you can properly fight off the virus.  

It works on the common cold as well, and according to the inventor, is 12 for 12 on curing people.  

And it all stemmed from CoughZero.

Now that they have a proper quarantined facility JUST for coronavirus, you're going to see rate of fatalities drop (assuming they properly stocked that hospital with proper resources).

I'm not saying we shouldn't fear coronavirus but average Americans shouldn't and it shouldn't be compared to the flu in a misleading way (even if that was not your intention). The virtue of being way more common makes the problem seem less prioritized in people's mind. Take for example alcohol. By all intents and purposes it is a very addictive drug yet average masses treat something less addictive and harmful with more scrutiny like weed or even as something as simple as drinking milk. People underestimate the dangers of something that's already dangerous simply because it's common; therefore it's not a real problem in their minds even though in reality it is.

This is why we had disproportionate amount of fear for banning guns while the same people who said we should ban guns text and drive/drive recklessly on a regular basis. I'm not a gun enthusiast but the contrast is to show the double standard; you see because car accidents kill more people a year than guns do in America and cars aren't even used as a weapon; it's used as a utility to enhance our lives where guns are ONLY legally used by law enforcement, military, or at a firing range. Does that mean we should fear guns more than cars even though average americans are exposed to dangers of car accident more than they are to guns? It's very important to talk about the numbers but the claim in regards to how fatal in comparison to something (anything comparable) should be reserved until we know more concrete information about this."

Also, I would assume that the people who negotiate and sign these deals are not those on the Daimler/Mercedes boards that will ultimately pull the plug. 

I could even see that signing this deal will be used by the team to highlight that the group does not have to put so much money into the team: ‚ÄúLook, we are getting more sponsors, we will not cost the group as much!‚Äù

Yesterday, news broke that Daimler is expected to reduce its staff by 15,000 (instead of 10,000 as was thought last November). I wonder if those cost-cutting measures will play a role in Merc‚Äôs F1 future. I guess there is a point where F1 expenditures look like a very extravagant marketing campaign if you cut cost everywhere else. 

I also think, the Merc F1 team is quite lucky that the economic fallout of the coronavirus is still completely unclear. If we were 3-4 months further into the outbreak and it became clear that there will be a recession (or at least an indication that the Chinese market for German cars is declining) then the group might be tempted to go the same route like Toyota and Honda did roughly a decade ago."

Uhuh, so Alli knew the guy just came from China and has been to the infected region, because he was cleaning his hands? No. He saw a Chinese person and went coronavirus, which is discriminating against the man based on his race.  I don't know why you're struggling to grasp that. Again you love to be pedantic and are fighting tooth and nail to clear Alli of being racist, but he was, it's not being sensetive or pc. If someone recorded the same video, a few years ago, in airport, sees someone black and goes ebola isn't catching me, is that not being racist. 

You keep banging on about racial insult, have you not been paying attention to the news? Racism and xenophobia has been on the rise since the outbreak, people are treating asains and Chinese people as if they're certain to infect them. Go speak to a Chinese people if you have the opportunity, speak to an international student if you can, then come back and decide on your stance. Is Alli a full on racist, no, he's not, I don't know him to a personal level but just looking at spurs, they've got players from every part of the world, to suggest he's racist is silly but that ""joke"" he made was racist, not some sugarcoated bs you're trying to deflect it to. 

Those are the definitions of the words, as I said, you love being pedantic, hence the Cambridge definition of racist, prejudice and discrimination. It's not my words hence the quote, I thought that was obvious. The part you're supposed to focus on is 

>or the resulting¬†unfair¬†treatment¬†of¬†members¬†of other¬†races

Because that's the relevant part. I left the unabridged version to show being racist doesn't just mean believing in superiority and I knew, you'd find that exact definition and begin to point it out (like you have). Alli has treated a member of another race differently for no good reason. If he was just taking precautions nobody would bat an eye, but the fact of the matter is, he singled out an asain man and said Corona can't catch me. A man minding his own business and wouldn't have received that treatment had he not been asain. 

>Stop watering down what racism is. The belief of superiority over another race. 

Racism isn't limited to extremist, stop ignoring the little thing. What kind of bullshit reasoning is this, as someone who's not white and British let me tell you, people have been racist without the whole I'm superior notion, I'm gonna add it's very rare and pretty much an outlier, but stop pandering around racism. 

>Racial insults lead to bad feelings. Racism leads to dehumanisation and genocide.

Again, you seem to think, unless it's a catastrophic level there is no racism, it's just insults which hurt feelings, you're either incredibly ignorant or purposefully ignoring things. There's so much more to racism than hurt feelings and I'm appealed I have to even talk about this. How is stripping a man of everything and seeing him as someone who could be infected not dehumanisation? How are you this thick? 

Racism is racism, there's no watering it down, from the smallest instances to the worst events, it's all racism, some things have worse consequences but it doesn't mean you ignore the lesser things because somehow it ""dilutes"" what it racism."
2020-02-11,michaelochurch,science,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/f24ozh/scientists_discover_mysterious_virus_in_brazil/fhb7233/,"This is a new virus, not one that has been known for years. Coronaviruses in general are nothing new‚Äì SARS was a coronavirus. Of course, they're not all the same. The 1918 influenza virus was a monster, while most flus have a low fatality rate. As for this coronavirus, it seems to be less deadly than SARS but a lot more infectious.

The good news is that case fatality rates tend to go down over time. For one thing, we get better at detecting mild cases that, before, we might have thought were merely colds or flus. For another, a parasite that kills its host is bad at staying alive and, typically, this means that, while it certainly can worsen, it is more likely in the long run to evolve to lesser lethality (contrary to Plague, Inc.) over time as less virulent strains win out.

The bad news is that, since this coronavirus is so infectious, this also means it will have more opportunities to mutate, so there is a chance of it becoming something a lot worse than what it is. Right now, it looks like it'll kill fewer people than an average flu season... but these things change. 

It's certainly something the WHO and CDC needs to keep an eye on, but is it something that merits a widespread freakout? No, not really, no more than SARS or MERS or the 2009 swine flu."

It would seem with a state this size, quarantine is best handled at the county and city level, which is what is happening. Not claiming it‚Äôs perfectly executed or anything. I recently listened to an informative podcast ‚ÄúThis Week in Virology‚Äù whose experts (virologists, what ho!)  said that in-home quarantine is the best. [TWiV](http://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-586/) 

Finally, CDC shows 68 cases being investigated in 37 states. So...Perhaps it‚Äôs premature to label California as an issue? East Coast has many ports of entry as well, but a few cases are popping up in land-locked states. I‚Äôm in no way claiming that we‚Äôre not going to have to deal with this virus in the US, but we don‚Äôt have enough info to work with, especially as lay people.[CDC nCov](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html)"

More than 40,000 infections have been confirmed, but experts are certain there are at least tens of thousands more.

Some never saw a doctor, and others had such mild symptoms that they didn‚Äôt even know they were sick.

But since the current infection count is too low, that death rate ‚Äî known formally as a ‚Äúcase fatality rate‚Äù or ‚Äúcase fatality ratio‚Äù ‚Äî is too high.

**Article**:

> SAN FRANCISCO (AP) ‚Äî Samsung on Tuesday unveiled a new foldable phone, the Galaxy Z Flip, its second attempt to sell consumers on phones with bendable screens and clamshell designs.

> The new phone can unfold from a small square upward into a traditional smartphone form, and will go on sale Feb. 14 starting at $1,380. The company announced the phone at a product event in San Francisco.

> Samsung‚Äôs first foldable phone, the Galaxy Fold, finally went on sale<!-- --> last September after delays and reports of screens breaking<!-- -->. The Fold, which carries a price tag of nearly $2,000, folds at a vertical crease rather than horizontally as a flip-phone design would. Motorola has also taken the flip-phone approach<!-- --> with its new $1,500 Razr phone.

> The foldable phones represent manufacturers‚Äô attempt to energize a market where sales have slowed. Many consumers are holding onto old phones longer, in part because new phone features offer increasingly marginal benefits. But these foldable models come with higher price tags and are likely to appeal for now mostly to tech enthusiasts and others at the forefront of technology.

> ‚ÄúWhile there‚Äôs a lot of excitement around this new category, it is still early days and they will evolve significantly.‚Äù said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight. ‚ÄúWhile these innovative new designs are nice to have, they‚Äôre not must-have, sought-after features among users.‚Äù

> The Z Flip can stay open at different angles for use watching videos or taking photos. When the phone is closed, it will take selfies and display notifications in a small window on the cover. Unfolded, its screen measures 6.7 inches diagonally.

> Samsung says it added fibers to the gap between the hinge and the phone to keep out dust and improve hinge function, likely to address shortcomings of the Galaxy Fold.

> For everyone else, Samsung offers its S series. In a nod to the start of the 2020s, the South Korean company showed off the Galaxy S20, S20 Plus and S20 Ultra, skipping directly to the S20 from its previous S10 series.

> The S20 phones are designed to take high-quality pictures in dark settings, Samsung product manager Mark Holloway said. The phones can take both video and photos at the same time, using artificial intelligence to zero in on the best moments to capture the still images.

> Samsung‚Äôs renewed focus on the camera follows other smartphone makers. Apple last fall announced the iPhone 11, which offers an additional lens for wider-angle shots and combined multiple shots with software to improve low-light images. Google‚Äôs Pixel phones also offer a similar low-light feature.

> Samsung‚Äôs S phones already offer the wider angle and some features for low-lighting. But the company says the new phones will focus on high-resolution photos and the ability to zoom in 30 to 100 times, depending on the model.

> The S20 phones go on sale in the U.S. on March 6, and will range in price from $1,000 to $1,400. All S20 models will be compatible with next-generation cellular networks,known as 5G, although it‚Äôs still an early technology<!-- --> that consumers typically won‚Äôt need yet. The Z Flip will not work with 5G networks.

> As people packed into San Francisco‚Äôs Palace of Fine Arts for Samsung‚Äôs launch event, they passed a team taking remote temperatures in the security line, likely a precaution to check for the coronavirus. Samsung also offered hand sanitizer stations and face masks inside the event lobby.

> ___

> Kelvin Chan reported from London.

The reason why we are not seeing more cases (yet), is because most countries don't have the infrastructure to test for the virus. In my country, for example, we had to send samples to the US CDC in order to verify if some Chinese citizens were infected. The tests resulted negative, but we all know here that the tests are not error proofed.

The worst part is that by not being proactive, the same thing that happened in Wuhan will happen everywhere else. When the infection cannot be hidden anymore, people with simple cold symptoms will rush to the hospitals and get infected with the coronavirus there, and those people will clog the health system in the process."

But due to the Chinese games policy every game needs to be reviewed by the gov before you can buy it (and the process is EXTREMELY slow), currently there are only 1 game in the eshop (New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe) and the console itself is also region locked so ppl won't usually buy that.

That being said tho you can still buy the international switch at 3rd party sellers for almost the same price (only costs 7 more dollars) but the games will be more expensive since you can't run Chinese version cartridges on the internation switches.

Also a small fact: Ring Fit Adventure is EXTREMELY expensive here recently due to the coronavirus, the average price is 1550 Yuan (~222 Dollars) and it's still rising (only 186 dollars a few days ago), even more expensive than a Nintendo Switch Lite. And we are unlikely to get an official release for that..."

It's a dumb question but with the Coronavirus going around I'm wondering how it works.

Those 13 infected in the US are being treated and quarantined for obvious reasons; it'll spread all over the place otherwise.

So is the treatment and anmeities free in cases like this? The government really has no choice but to help them, and they themselves don't have a choice to not go to the hospital to avoid the costs.

Do note this isn't a foolish attempt at arguing against forced treatment for Coronavirus or a statement on economic models anything stupid like that, I'm just genuinely curious about this."

But before goodbyes were said, a group photo was in order. Like high school seniors flinging graduation caps, the Americans triumphantly tossed their face masks into the air.

‚ÄúThe passengers are very appreciative of the support and services but excited to get home and get back to their normal lives,‚Äù said Kim Saruwatari, director of public health for Riverside County. The scene was a happy one, she said.

The group included State Department employees and children,¬†two of whom developed fevers¬†during the quarantine after¬†fleeing the coronavirus epicenter¬†in Wuhan. Two days after the travelers‚Äô landing, the U.S. government issued a mandatory quarantine for them ‚Äî the first in more than 50 years ‚Äî which kept them on the base for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus.

‚ÄúPlease understand that people on and off the base are not at increased risk for exposure to the new virus, and we don‚Äôt restrict people who don‚Äôt actually pose any risk,‚Äù Kaiser said.
‚ÄúThey have had no contact with the evacuees, whose area is fully separated from base personnel.

SANTA CLARA COUNTY, Calif. (KRON) ‚Äì The coronavirus outbreak has also led to the declaration of a local emergency in Santa Clara County but what exactly doesn‚Äôt that mean?

The emergency declaration does not mean any increase in risk to residents of Santa Clara County.  

Quite the opposite, it‚Äôs meant to reassure them that health authorities are ready should evidence surface that the virus is spreading.

Board of Supervisors Chair Cindy Chavez said the declaration of a local emergency essentially does two things.

‚ÄúFirst, we‚Äôre very transparent with the public about what the emergency is and what we can do about it, and then the second is to make sure that any money that we spend on these initiatives so that we can spend if the emergency requires it and be repaid by the state and federal government,‚Äù Chavez said.

Despite two confirmed cases of coronavirus in the county, there is no evidence the virus is spreading.  

On Monday, county health officer Dr. Sara Cody told supervisors the risk to the public remains low.  

The emergency declaration does not change that but will help health care providers be better prepared if more virus is detected, says Chavez.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre training people, we‚Äôre making sure folks have the appropriate gear so if they do find someone whose sick, that they can protect themselves. We‚Äôre making sure that if we identify someone whose sick that we have a safe way to handle them so other people aren‚Äôt affected,‚Äù Chavez said.

In both cases of confirmed coronavirus, the two infected people, a man and woman both had recently traveled to Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.  

The declaration also opens the door for the county to access mutual aid resources from other jurisdictions and will undergo a review later this month says the board chair.

‚ÄúThe health and hospital committee will take another look at our response so that we make sure we‚Äôre doing our optimal in terms of responding,‚Äù Chavez said.

This emergency declaration was first declared back on February 3.

The supervisor‚Äôs action this week entends that by 30 days to March 11."

> SINGAPORE - Doctors in the public sector will have to restrict their work to within one hospital, while patients and healthcare staff should also limit their movements across different healthcare premises.

> The Ministry of Health (MOH) sent this directive to public hospitals in a bid to reduce the risk of cross-institutional transmission of the coronavirus. It took effect from Monday (Feb 10) and applies to all public hospital staff, including administrative and ancillary staff.

> Responding to queries from The Straits Times, an MOH spokesman said that while public hospitals remain committed to offering essential services such as treatment of coronavirus cases and emergency cases, non-urgent treatments and appointments are being progressively deferred where clinically appropriate, to allow hospitals to focus on essential services.

> This means that patients who see doctors at different hospitals for various ailments will have to decide which institution they want to stick with.

> Said the ministry: ""We will be working closely with the healthcare institutions to explore various means for this to be carried out effectively without impacting patient care and safety.""

> It did not give other details.

> Healthcare professionals in the private hospitals and specialist clinics have also been advised to similarly avoid cross-institutional movement, said the ministry. It is not mandatory for them at this point.

> Parkway Pantai, Mount Alvernia Hospital and Thomson Medical said they will be following the MOH guidelines closely, their spokesmen told ST. They are awaiting further instructions.

> Said a Thomson Medical spokesman: ""Should the restriction be implemented, we anticipate some impact to maternity patients, who will have to decide if they wish to follow their gynaecologist or the hospital of their choice to see to their maternity needs.""

> Related Story Interactive: What we know so far about the coronavirus

> At Parkway Pantai, which is the biggest private chain with four hospitals, doctors in its employ will be restricted to one facility, similar to those in government hospitals, says Dr Noel Yeo, chief executive officer of Mount Elizabeth Hospital. These are usually accident and emergency staff doctors or radiologists.

> But specialist doctors can choose up to two Parkway Pantai hospitals at which to treat their patients. In a circular sent to the doctors, they were told they have up to noon on Friday to declare their primary and secondary sites of practice.

> The restriction will take effect from next Monday.

> The Parkway Pantai chain of hospitals in Singapore includes Mount Elizabeth, Gleneagles, East Shore and Mount Elizabeth Novena.

> Said Dr Tan Chi Chiu, a gastroenterologist with a clinic at Gleneagles Hospital: ""We had the separation during Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) as well and we coped. Personally, I do all my work in Gleneagles anyway so it doesn't affect me.""

> One doctor who requested not to be named, questioned if private-sector specialist doctors should be allowed to move between two hospitals and clinics.

> He said: ""There is a high chance of the virus spreading in hospitals, just like during Sars period. Hence limiting the movement of doctors to one hospital will help to limit the spread of the virus.""

Doing that is going to upset some people considering one of their friends just died.

The rumors themselves were complete overreactions to normal state responses to unexplained and unattended deaths. The speculative comments were made on the announcement post of the students death. 

Speculating and spreading admitted rumors about how he might have died from the disease and that _'people need to know about this right now this might be the first death on US soil from the cornavirus, also he went to undergrad in china'_ is just fearmongering. And doing it on the subreddit of a school where one doesn't even live near and _on the post announcing the student's death_ is tactless.

Half of the rumors about the student being spread by two users from this subreddit weren't even true and the users whined about how students from the school were idiots for downvoting and arguing with them about their 'facts'."

When your body gets infected, most of the symptoms are actually your body's immune system fighting it off. This includes neutrophils and macrophages. Then, t-cells start to move in and kill cells infected by the virus. B cells create the antibodies used to attack antigens left behind by macrophages but are usually virus specific. So b cells need to be triggered by a prior attack to be generating virus specific antibodies. Vaccines work on this theory by the way.

So the person had the coronavirus and his immune system went into the defensive mode that new viruses will trigger. By recovering and shaking off this particular virus attack, the immune system should now have the antibodies that allow him to be not that vulnerable against that particular strain of coronavirus."

2020-02-11,Kujo17,cvnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cvnews/comments/f2kygt/coronavirus_doctors_staff_and_patients_to/fhd7vre/,"SINGAPORE - Doctors in the public sector will have to restrict their work to within one hospital, while patients and healthcare staff should also limit their movements across different healthcare premises.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) sent this directive to public hospitals in a bid to reduce the risk of cross-institutional transmission of the coronavirus. It took effect from Monday (Feb 10) and applies to all public hospital staff, including administrative and ancillary staff.

Responding to queries from The Straits Times, an MOH spokesman said that while public hospitals remain committed to offering essential services such as treatment of coronavirus cases and emergency cases, non-urgent treatments and appointments are being progressively deferred where clinically appropriate, to allow hospitals to focus on essential services.

This means that patients who see doctors at different hospitals for various ailments will have to decide which institution¬†they want to stick with.
Said the ministry: ""We will be working closely with the healthcare institutions to explore various means for this to be carried out effectively without impacting patient care and safety.""
It did not give other details.

Healthcare professionals in the private hospitals and specialist clinics have also been advised to similarly avoid cross-institutional movement, said the ministry. It is not mandatory for them at this point.
Parkway Pantai, Mount Alvernia Hospital and Thomson Medical said they will be following the MOH guidelines closely, their spokesmen told ST. They are awaiting further instructions.

Said a Thomson Medical spokesman: ""Should the restriction be implemented, we anticipate some impact to maternity patients, who will have to decide if they wish to follow their gynaecologist or the hospital of their choice to see to their maternity needs.""

The restriction will take effect from next Monday.
The Parkway Pantai chain of hospitals in Singapore includes Mount Elizabeth, Gleneagles, East Shore and Mount Elizabeth Novena.
Said Dr Tan Chi Chiu, a gastroenterologist with a clinic at Gleneagles Hospital: ""We had the separation during Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) as well and we coped. Personally, I do all my work in Gleneagles anyway so it doesn't affect me.""

One doctor who requested not to be named, questioned if private-sector specialist doctors should be allowed to move between two hospitals and clinics.
He said: ""There is a high chance of the virus spreading in hospitals, just like during Sars period. Hence limiting the movement of doctors to one hospital will help to limit the spread of the virus."""

No Bayes is mentioned at any point, although it should be.

My personal response on ""Why Singapore has more cases than Hong Kong""

The same reason why Indonesia has no cases. Sampling methodology matters.

If you don't test any cases, you have no confirmed cases.
If you test only the serious cases with late stage symptoms, the disease looks serious because deaths are over represented. 
If you test all the cases that are likely to be infected given contact, , or are likely to fit the criteria, you will get a more accurate picture of Covid19 from disease infection to resolution. 

Singapore will probably be as close to perfect on the stats  as you can get on disease infection, incubation, progression and mortality because of our tight, ahem, Social controls, interconnectedness and overall, extreme competence, as the  MOH and SPF divisions responsible for quarantine are mostly excellent. No comments on Cisco though.

Where does Singapore fall down?

Decision making under asymmetric information and assessment of payoffs and outcomes.

The general rule in making decisions under uncertainty is to acknowledge the asymmetric information,  make explicit your assumptions and probabilities in the situation, then limit the downside so as to preserve all available resources, especially human life.  When new, credible and probable information is received, adjust your response in light of what you now know, according to how payoffs change. 

In just about any other situation, with a human opponent, you can escalate and tier your responses, because situations are generally reversible with the right incentives and more information. You can negotiate with terrorists - or choose not to. One does not negotiate with a virus. Or an earthquake, tsunami, volcano or wildfire. 

With this virus, as well as natural disasters, they have a binary nature - neutral - or a flare up. It's a on-off situation, with nothing in between. When natural disasters flare up, the appropriate response is always to follow the plan that keeps you the safest UNTIL you have information about how severe/mild it is.

Here's why:
You're either uninfected, or infected. 
You're either evacuated for a tsunami/volcano/wildfire, or at risk for being a casualty statistic. 

However, preparations must be taken AT earliest opportunity because you do not have the margin to 'just respond'.

At present, there is also no definitive standard to cure that is clinically proven to alleviate/arrest/cure Covid19  disease progression. There is also no Vaccine for covid19. To paraphrase the very Singaporean saying ""Sorry no cure"", ""Covid 19 no cure"". 
The only way to stay safe is to not catch it. 

Unfortunately, in the current situation, the horse, like the virus, is out of the stable and in community. The tsunami is on you. There is no wait and see. Overpreparers are 'panicky and paranoid' until they are not - and the underprepared, let's hope they are still alive to point and jeer. Being pointed and jeered at for being overprepared IS the best case scenario for everyone. Singaporeans will all be lucky if this time next year, we are eating last weekends instant noodles, rice and tinned goods. 

Over preparing, both as individuals and as a society, is the equivalent in financial markets of capping your downside risk, by paying money for an option, buying home, life, fire and travel insurance. This is why we have National Service - Singaporeans are a people who sweat in peacetime so that we bleed less in wartime - or that wartime never comes. I for one, applaud the people who have stocked up. It means they are prepared to stay home and prevent the virus from spreading... Although the rush to the supermarket likely created a mass community transmission event. 

After CNY, Singapore should have ordered school, NS closures as an insurance policy, traced traveller's from China and isolated them and cancelled large events like Chingay, taking our cue from the extraordinary measures that China took in Wuhan and Beijing, in as diplomatic a fashion as possible. The Coronavirus was going to wreck the economy anyway, this would not have added much more. We should have used it as a total defence day/social cohesion exercise, distributed masks, food, made preparations. 

 Would we have had community spread then? We'll never know. The Covid 19 horse is out of its Singapore stable and we'll have to wait and see how much of the Singapore population and economy has been kicked and smashed to bits. Hopefully last weekends panic retail buying will make a dent in the tourist receipts deficit. 

Given what we know now about the extreme infectivity of Covid 19, when cases can infect others even a day or two after their own initial infection with no symptoms (British nativd index case, German case), add the long incubation period, non-specific disease etiology and initial mild symptoms, you have a perfect recipe for pandemic spread. Let's not forget the incredible infectivity of a recently zoonotic virus meeting the virgin human population. 

Don't get me started on the death rates - if disease progression from infection to resolution - choose death or recovery is 3 to 5 or 7 weeks, judging from Dr Li Wen Liang's case (which might be the one accurate statistic we have), saying at Week 2.5 (which is where we are in the Singapore outbreak) ""that everyone is fine"" is counting your white chickens before they've died.

If you believe the 0.2% death rate, or that only people of Chinese/Asian extraction can get covid 19, keep holding your breath, you might need it at some point for when the pneumonia progresses. Turns out, Germans, Brits, French, Americans and Bangladeshis can all contract Covid19 just as easily as the people of Chinese/Asian extraction. 

The one silver lining to this debacle is that Singapore will likely to be the only have captured the false negatives (people that don't look infected but are) that China has missed, the mild superspreader cases like the unfortunate Briton who attended the conference at Grand Hyatt. This will give the world a much better assessment of the actual risk and costs of Covid19, so that measures can be calibrate - provided the virus does not mutate. 

 Hopefully, we will also have avoided self-fulfilling false positives by quarantining suspected Covid19 cases so they don't infect people already suffering from Influenza, Pneumonia or other common colds. Given the debacle of the infected Cisco Quarantine Order server, I am not so sure. 

Singapore and the rest of the world will find out in another 2 to 4 weeks whether we've been extraordinarily lucky and have contained the spread - or we have lots of data to give the world.

I hope that we are lucky, and that I am wrong. I pray that I am wrong."

Then it was revealed that the virus was barely even deadly at all, literally less deadly than the existing flu, and the containment measures were lifted and the WHO urged everyone to avoid extreme measures to contain it. They basically didn't view it as worthy of stopping, and it spread similar to the way the normal flu does. 

Also, it killed 175,000-500,000 worldwide, not 14,800. But again, this was lower than the average flu virus.

There is A LOT of false information and fear mongering going on there right now. The science-based comments are being buried and the sensational stuff is being promoted. 

To put things into perspective, the regular flu (the one that comes around every year) has already killed 12 000 Americans this season. Nobody is freaking out about that. 

People are concerned about this coronavirus because it is new. That doesn't mean that it is extremely bad. The people who have died so far seem to be older and have underlying medical conditions. If you are young and healthy, there is a good chance that even if you did catch it, you would recover just fine. Some people have such a mild reaction to it that they don't even know that they have it.

OK, now the bad part. It sounds like you were POTENTIALLY exposed. Sure, it's possible. Frankly, you can't do anything about that now. The very best thing you can do is get enough sleep, get good nutrition, and stop worrying.

(As a disclaimer, yes, China seems very concerned about this virus, which naturally makes us suspicious that it could be worse than what they are letting on. Eventually we will find out, but right now there is nothing that we can do about that, other than taking personal responsibility for our own health (sleep, nutrition, etc.). Again, stay away from the sensational videos from unknown sources. A lot of them are likely fake. There is so much 'fake news' (about everything; politics, health, science, celebrities, whatever) on the Internet and continually watching these videos and hearing 'updates' will only increase your anxiety.  

As you say, you have 'minimal to no symptoms'."

This kind of post is more appropriate for the daily discussion thread on the top of the front page of this subreddit.

We here at r/China_flu recommend following the guidelines and advice given by trusted sources. Your local health officials, the World Health Organization, and others have been actively monitoring the situation and providing guidance to the public about it.

Some resources which may be applicable to your situation are as follows:

    The World Health Organization website, which has regularly updated situation reports, travel advice and advice to the public on protecting yourself from infections.

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019

    The CDC (USA) website which provides Risk assessments, Travel advice, and FAQs relating to the 2019 nCoV outbreak.

    The UK's Department of Health and Social Care's guidance to the public.

If you believe you may have symptoms of the Novel Coronavirus or feel you may have been exposed to the virus, speak to a doctor and/or contact your local health officials for further guidance.

Follow the advice of users in this post at your own risk. Any advice that exceeds the recommendations of public officials or your health care provider may simply be driven by panic and not the facts."

I'm sure I've read the quite harsh and frightening sound of ""_AIDS_"" helped with raising awareness to prevent its spread. 

Isn't the common cold also spread by a coronavirus? That's a good one too, for the opposite reasons. It sounds quite mild and non-threatening, but a little unpleasant. ""a cold"" - job done. No need to get worried, but it is unpleasant so cover your mouth and wash your hands. 

As for the scariest disease name - Ebola is fantastic. Again, slightly because of association, but cadence wise it sounds frightening. Got an air of ""vomit"" and ""blood"" about it, which are of course two of the symptoms."

The page you linked specifically references ""it costs more to get goods into the shop"" and:

* Suppliers have [ramped up their prices dramatically](https://www.livingstone.com.au/#/Searchv2/Keyword=p2+N95+MASKS/Relevance/) due to scalping;
* The same suppliers are giving away masks (or selling at reduced prices) to anyone with a genuine medical condition that [contacts them](https://www.livingstone.com.au/Pages/CSP);
* The pharmacy price is below the supplier cost via Livingstone.

What you're seeing is basically the 'daigou'/'locust' phenomenon that happened with baby formula. There should be laws put in place to address this and prevent this kind of behaviour when it comes to medical goods as:

* It's going to hit the supply of masks to medical professionals and people with a genuine medical need for them;
* It's already hitting industry, because people can't get PPE;
* All advice indicates that you *personally* don't need a mask for coronavirus unless you have the disease;
* Restrictions on mask sales under pandemic action plans are already a thing;
* We have limited capacity to manufacture new masks locally, and other governments are reserving their mask production under pandemic plans;
* This kind of profiteering by individuals isn't covered under existing laws.

None of this probably helps you though. If you're looking for masks because of coronavirus for personal use, don't. You don't need them. If you're looking for them for PPE (for sanding), you know who still has then in stock. If you're looking for them so that you can profiteer or export them yourself to family, you're part of the problem here."

Actually it is turning out fluids is almost never a good treatment for a case like viral sepsis from a coronavirus. In fact, the literature seems to be building that almost all management of lowered BP (CVP) from sepsis with fluids (whether it be crystal, plasma, etc.) is just wrong. (higher mortalities + comorbidities). 

It's an old dogma, and it stems partly from physiology (we see low blood pressure and want to correct it and overfocus on this) and partly from the fact that getting fluids *feels good* initially... But then these patients die more often afterwards.

Probably fluid therapies *should* be positive for severely enteropathic (vira/bacteria that taps your fluid by being pathogenic in the GI tract and causing diarrhea), but these can be subdivided too and it seems like most patients should just get enough to drink."

1. Symptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu:

‚ÄúI've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.

The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.‚Äù

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient‚Äôs travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC ‚Äúpersons under investigation‚Äù case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient‚Äôs nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase‚Äìpolymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient‚Äôs vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient‚Äôs oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient‚Äôs ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient‚Äôs clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

If that is the case, you and I have little to talk about. That would mean you trust in government so much that you would empower it to take control from the people, and yet still act in the people's best interests - despite the whole of human history demonstrating the contrary result.

Brexit is a perfect example. If Europe doesn't want to buy a tea kettle from Great Britain, then Great Britain can simply shift its products to the United States market. Also, you are completely missing the point of the Brexit analogy. Bureaucrats in Brussels made those laws - and because England was in the European Union, it had to abide by them. So the people voted to leave the European Union, so they could make their own laws, and not be governed by people who have no business wielding authority over them. That has nothing to do with isolationism or nationalism, it is human nature to want to be free.

We will see how great you think globalization is when just-in-time supply chains start drying up because of the coronavirus quarantines. Fewer wars and conflicts - I'm with you there, that those are good end results to seek at least. Globalization doesn't lead to those ends, however.

Brunei student Abdul Najib  bin Haji Ladi, successfully evacuated from Wuhan last weekend, shared  his experiences of being in the Chinese city placed under lockdown since  January 24, due to the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus.

The 28-year-old had been  studying new energy science and engineering at the Huazhong University  of Science and Technology in Wuhan‚Äôs Hongshan District since 2018, after  he was selected for the Chinese Scholarship Council by the Government  of the People‚Äôs Republic of China.

Communicating through  WhatsApp from the National Isolation Centre in the Tutong District where  he is quarantined, Abdul Najib recalled, ‚ÄúWhen the virus was first  discovered (December 31, 2019-January 1), it wasn‚Äôt that intense. We  were still going out, as usual.

‚ÄúHowever when the situation took a turn for the worse, we were all rushing to buy/stock up on groceries and necessities.

‚ÄúI was staying at my  university hostel. Under lockdown, the city grew deadly silent. We were  all told to be indoors, to contain the outbreak.‚Äù Abdul Najib was alone,  as his Indonesian roommate had gone home for the holidays before the  outbreak occurred.

‚ÄúEmotionally, it was quite  stressful for me to stay cooped up for so long and having hardly any  interaction with other people, apart from video calls with my family,‚Äù  he said.

 

‚ÄúThere was constant fear as  well, given the increasing number of infections on a daily basis.  Fortunately, I had enough food with me. The apartment management also  helped us to get more food.

‚ÄúWe all feared that we would run out of food supplies, as Wuhan was placed under lockdown. ‚Äú

Abdul Najib also kept in  constant touch with Brunei officials since January 24. ‚ÄúThey called me  every day to get updates on my health status,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOn January 28,  they informed me through WeChat about an evacuation plan, and gave  details of the operation.

‚ÄúOn February 7, they came to my university to pick me up. I was finally on my way home.‚Äù

He was then placed on board  a Royal Brunei Airlines (RB) flight with a fellow Bruneian who had also  been stranded in Wuhan. They arrived in Bandar Seri Begawan at 2.45am,  on February 8. Abdul Najib expressed his gratitude to the Brunei  Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the  Ministry of Education and the Embassy of Brunei Darussalam in China for  helping to evacuate them from Wuhan.

‚ÄúI also thank my family, friends and the  public for their prayers and sympathies. I also pray that Brunei will be  protected from the coronavirus,‚Äù he said."
