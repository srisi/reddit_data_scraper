> 
> I was not going to share my story, but now that I see others are reporting very different symptoms than mine I feel it‚Äôs important to tell everyone my experience.
> 
> February 29th: I woke up this day in agony. My head was pounding, my ears throbbing, and it felt as if my throat was on fire. My body ached, I had chills, and I had a fever of 100.2. I took over the counter anti-inflammatories and stayed in bed the entire day.
> 
> March 1st: I woke up feeling better but with the growing concerns in Italy, I decided to see a doctor. The doctor saw me and said I had a cold. I proceeded with my day. At this point, I had begun to lose hearing in my left ear, I figured it was congestion. Still I had NO cough.
> 
> March 2nd: Hearing in both ears was significantly less. I could feel phlegm in the back of my throat, but once again, I thought it was just a cold, as I‚Äôd been told by a professional. As Italy was starting to become a place of concern our program urged us to return home.
> 
> March 3rd: My last day in Italy, I still couldn‚Äôt hear, and at this point I lost all ability to taste and smell, yet I did not have a runny nose or cough. I had a headache constantly during the day which I just treated with Tylenol. I left the next morning to return to America.
> 
> March 4th: This is the day I look back on and get scared. I flew home, and not a single person asked where I had been. Not even at customs. They didn‚Äôt blink an eye at me. I had layovers in LARGE cities. Again, there was no doubt in my mind that I didn‚Äôt have the virus.
> 
> March 5th-13th: As we were told, I stayed in self quarantine during these days. I had contact with only two people. No symptoms were present that the CDC warned us about. I had a WET cough. And my hearing, taste, and smell finally returned.
> 
> March 13th: Yes, I got tested on Friday the 13th, coincidence? I was not planning on being tested. However, members of my family work in health care & wanted to be sure before returning to work. We had to ask to be tested, they refused until we asked repeatedly.

This patient had gone on spring break and come back with a cough and shortness of breath so bad he could barely walk across a room. I am very concerned that younger people look at the mortality numbers from the WHO (0.2%) and not realize they are susceptible too. Sure, they may only die at 0.2%, but they are susceptible to hospitalization, ICU admission. 

14-20% of patients 20-44 needed hospitalization from a CDC report that recently came out. Sure we may be able to keep these people alive 0.2% of the time, but is that really the best way to measure risk? I want to emphasize this because it‚Äôs important for young people to do their part with social distancing.

I am also very concerned about what will happen because of spring break. I think there have been reports of younger people ignoring social distancing recommendations and then potentially returning home from vacations and spreading COVID.

Just last Saturday, a digital health thermometer company, Kinsa, showed data that indicated an unusual rise in fevers in South Florida, even though it's not a known Covid-19 cluster. Our worry: is this because of spring breakers? The elderly? A local cluster in Florida? The fear is that this will be a potential new spreading cluster with people flying back from spring break into their homes and igniting thousands of smaller cluster across the USA. Keep in mind that the South Korean outbreak can almost solely be attributed to a single person (Patinet #31) who did not self quarantine, then went to church and buffets while positive with COVID. Please, please let's do our part to not be that patient.

**TL;DR: Please don‚Äôt be our patient #31. Self isolate, especially if you‚Äôre young and healthy.**

She was turned away twice by the local ER because she had a low temperature instead of a high one. Since Monday, she has been in the hospital, and still there is no result for the test. Her chest and body hurts, she's coughing, and she can't breath very well. Her white blood cell count is also very low.

&#x200B;

Why, WHY does it take THAT much, as Bradley said, to get somebody's attention?  I don't care about politics. I did, but this pandemic changed that. There won't be any ""leaders"" left or any ""differences"" to have if everybody is dead or dying with a tube in their throat. These ""leaders"" need to use every ounce of power they have to save humans. That means rich humans, poor humans, bad humans, good humans. Obviously I'm involved in the situation because of my partner, and I've taken all the appropriate steps to ensure nobody gets this if I have it. For now, I don't think I do. But hey, I have asthma, so if I get it, will I have to suffocate on somebody's ER door before I get tested? Why? Is it because I don't wear a suit and talk to a large crowd about all of the nice things I'm going to do for them? 

&#x200B;

And I'm not angry. Anger is not the answer here. Holding the people responsible for stories such as these, stories such as mine, that can all happen in a world where a solution is found for this virus. Until then, the ""differences"" need to be put aside. And if not for caring, then because you can't profit off of unfortunate people with no power... if you let them all die because they weren't important enough to save."

2020-03-20,Emergencydocs,Coronavirus,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/flvu7k/im_ali_raja_md_and_shuhan_he_md_emergency/fl19koh/,"So let‚Äôs talk generally about cleaning surfaces, and we‚Äôll also touch on food. 
 
There is some evidence that shows that the virus can be found on surfaces for up to 7 days on a surface if you put droplets of the virus on it. If you cough (aerosolized it) well up to a few hours to days too. A recent study in NEJM showed it can last in the air up to an hour after a sneeze or cough. That is dangerous.
 
In a normal world, I do try to clean contact surfaces every week or two (doorknobs, buttons, etc). In this situation what I recommend is to increase it periodically (perhaps to every 4-6 hours) based on the number of customers and if anyone has symptoms. A person simply handling a doorknob is not an issue, as much as someone coughing and sneezing onto their hand and then handling the doorknob.  This is exceptionally tough for grocery and other stores to gauge, however, and so the important thing is that everyone who is symptomatic (coughing, etc.) absolutely stays home in self-quarantine - you WILL spread the virus if you go out, so please get someone else to bring your groceries to you instead.
 
As we may all be realizing now, in reality, life itself - in every aspect - presents risk factors, but we should use common sense. The most important thing I want to communicate is that people should still continue to live their lives as much as possible with social isolation, continue their normal habits while quarantined, and take care of themselves. This is particular for things like not obsessing with over-cleaning, (which can be harmful). 

However, please be cautious and make sensible decisions about cleanliness when going shopping - for example,* absolutely do wash* your vegetables and food after coming home from the supermarket, where it may have been handled by any number of people before you. Send people to get groceries or have them delivered by people who aren‚Äôt coughing or showing symptoms. That would be sensible too. We‚Äôll address wearing masks in public in a different question, but they‚Äôre certainly closely related.
 
**TL;DR: Wash your food, hands and surfaces frequently. Stay at home if you have a cough.**

* 22 days (on average) from onset of symptoms to recovery
* 6 days (on average) from onset of symptoms to hospitalization 
* 14 to 22 days (different studies have different findings) from symptom onset to death

And these are mostly uncertain numbers and are largely based on Hubei, so you should internally factor in probably at least a week or possible error on the entire timeline from infection to resolution.

When I think about when you might see the results of a new policy, I'd say 10 days is the optimistic timeline but it might be 14-21 before you'd have a better idea of whether lockdowns, etc. are helping. And this is assuming nothing changes with who is getting tested."
