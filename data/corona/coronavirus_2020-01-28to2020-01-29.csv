Not even coronavirus can stop Germans from going to work! But seriously, the articles I've been reading say that it takes at least a week to recover, so recovery over a weekend -- even if it's not fully recovered -- seems pretty fast."

Anyone who tells you this is just the flu is lying. 

It's really important that we be accurate with information. There is two camps who have been dominating the entire discussion. Those who attempt to downplay and ridicule, and those who think this is the end of the world. All things considered this may be the worst pandemic since the 1917 flu, by the time it is over. But the vast majority of those deaths will be in China. Which doesn't make it any better, but it's an important distinction. 

This is not the average flu. It poses a very high risk to those with compromised immune systems and respiratory issues. I understand the want from governing bodies to try and downplay it to prevent panic, but lots of epidemiologists have been following the developments from China, and it is very alarming. This is one of the exact nightmare scenarios that epidemiologists have been warning about, a novel Coronavirus from a wetmarket in Asia. It's exactly what happened with SARS.

Our health practices are much better here than in China, so the r0 will almost certainly be lower here. It still poses a great risk to certain populations, though. Besides the elderly, this is not a disease you want the homeless camps to get infected with."

I worked closely with Government during the both SARS and Swine flu epidemics, strategies for airports and hospitals during the ZIKA outbreak and worked on Relenza (Tamiflu) amongst a whole host of other research projects related to communicable disease and the like.

Quarantining people on Christmas Island is actually a good move, maybe the first decent move the Goverment has made in a while. Please hear me out before you downote me to the moon and back.

The issue of refugees/Scomo/bushfires aside, Christmas island has an existing quarantine station with modern medical equipment and ability to deal with a large number of patients. There is a modern and well maintained airstrip that can handle large aircraft (military included), the centre itself is secure and there are staff on the island familiar with it's operations.

The relatively small population and very low rate of travel to and from the island greatly reduces the risk of the virus spreading and the high humidity and warmer environment plays a part in reducing the spread from person to person of the disease due to respiratory droplet transmission (seasonality aside - Infuenza at least has an easier time spreading in cold and dry environments).

The Government would have been advised by highly qualified people both here and internationally with regards to the quarantine (there are national/international advisory bodies that governments almost always defer to in situations like this, regardless of political affiliation)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My personal advice, having seen much of the data and working on the issue itself, is to not panic. The media absolutely froths for a *28 days later* type scenario, do not get dragged down into a click-baited panic. Australia has the worlds **BEST** practice for dealing with bio-security issues and viral epidemics, many of the worlds foremost experts on disease control and viral management are here and our public health system copes with something far, far worse each and every year (stock-standard Flu season kills thousands yearly here).

Stay away from hospitals and doctors surgeries unless you actually need to go, take precautions around travel to and from SEA/Asia, monitor your symptoms if you come down with something. If you are immuno-compromised then take all necessary precautions and heed the advice or your GP. **HOWEVER the situation is evolving daily. You can find up to date info here** \- [https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov).

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22174333

Notes:

- for first time seeing analysts excited about other products, watch and airpods as being real drivers of bottom line revenue!!!

- interesting note from Bloomberg tech reporter ""Apple’s new revenue strategy isn’t a bad one. It’s, basically, sell the customer an iPhone every three to five years, and make a bunch of money in the years between by selling them a new Apple Watch or AirPods (which only last about three years tops before you need a new pair -- batteries!) and services. If a user subscribes to all of Apple’s services for two years straight, that’s about equal to revenue from a new iPhone. So in those cases, if that user doesn’t buy a new iPhone for a couple years, it’s not a big deal.""

- apples done so well lately that the average analysts has a target price 5% below what apple is currently trading at

- they manufacture iphones 400 km from the center of the coronavirus outbreak, see if this is mentioned, also about 18% of apple revenue so China matters

- want to see what their effective tax rate is

Numbers:

- stocks almost back to record highs before reporting, after reporting it shot way past!!

- 1Q Revenue is $91.8B vs estimates of $88.38B!!!!!!

- 1Q EPS is $4.99 vs estimates of$4.56!!!!!

- wearables was $10 vs $7.3 last year( apple just continues to create $10+ billion dollar business every 3-5 years. Use to be that only MSFT could do that and GOOG spent heavily trying to do that

- iphone revenue for 1Q is $55.97

- service revenue for 1Q is $12.72

- declines in both mac($7.1 vs $7.4 last year) and iPad sales($6 vs %6.7 last year)

- iphone sales up everywhere except Japan

Numbers that really impress

- Cash/Equivalents have doubled from last year, that funds a lot of money loosing streaming shows

- keeping in mind they bought back $37B in stock this year

- almost $100B in term debt

Supply Chain:

- Qurvo up 1%

- Skyworks up 1%

- Cirrus up 3%"

> (Miwa SUZUKI, AFP) – The first Japanese nationals evacuated from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of a deadly virus outbreak, arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday aboard a charter plane.

> The plane landed at Haneda airport around 8:45am (1145 GMT), with officials saying 206 people were on board.

> Airport workers wearing face masks immediately began unloading luggage from the aircraft, and several buses pulled up, but there was no immediate sign of passengers leaving the plane. Ambulances could be seen nearby.

> Earlier, health ministry officials said medical professionals on board the flight would carry out health checks but that there were no plans to quarantine the arriving passengers.

> The flight arrived as several countries work to extract their nationals from Wuhan, with an American charter flight also leaving the city on Wednesday, bound for an airport in the Los Angeles area.

> The flight chartered by the Japanese government had arrived in Wuhan overnight carrying emergency relief supplies including 15,000 masks, 50,000 pairs of gloves and 8,000 protective glasses, the foreign ministry said.

> Around four medical officials were also on board to monitor returning passengers.

> Government officials said Tuesday that evacuees would be asked to fill out a health questionnaire and that anyone displaying symptoms on the flight would be taken to hospital immediately upon arrival in Japan.

> **Asked to avoid crowds**

> All passengers were expected to be tested for the new strain of coronavirus, which has killed more than 100 people and infected thousands.

> The evacuees would be asked to remain at home and avoid crowds at least until the results of the test were known, officials said.

> Those who live in and near Tokyo will be allowed to head home, while those living further away will be taken to local hotels initially.

> Japan’s health ministry has so far confirmed seven cases of the virus in the country, including one man who had not travelled to China.

> The man from the western region of Nara had driven a tour bus with tourists from Wuhan twice in January, the health ministry said.

> Japan’s foreign ministry says around 650 Japanese nationals in the Wuhan area have asked to be repatriated, and local media reported Wednesday that Tokyo was preparing to send a second charter flight, possibly later Wednesday, to collect more people.

> Chinese authorities said Wednesday that the number of confirmed deaths in the outbreak has risen to 132 nationwide, with the confirmed total of infections now nearly 6,000.

> More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan, the central industrial city where the outbreak first began, in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to other cities in China and to other countries.

> Chinese President Xi Jinping called the virus a “demon” during talks on Tuesday with the head of the World Health Organization in Beijing, and pledged a “timely” release of updates about the crisis.

she did not have symptoms— so this may also confirm the hypothesis that the virus can be transferred while the carrier is without symptoms.

Hong Kong University warned about exactly this at the end of their Lancet study when they studied the family cluster that presented to their Shenzhen facility.

First the mother of patient 4 acquired 2019 coronavirus even though she never went to Wuhan, but also the ten year old son of patient 4 —who did not display symptoms— had the virus. The doctors only did a scan of the boy’s lungs because the parents were “nervous “. Low and behold he had lung involvement, and tested positive for the virus.

The Hong Kong University specifically warned of “walking pneumonia”.

Also an earlier paper talked about how since this virus can sometimes present with no upper respiratory symptoms, or negligible upper respiratory symptoms such as the sniffles and sneezing, etc that those cases are hard to detect.

I know you aren't doing it intentionally, but this is spreading misinformation.

The flu has a mortality rate of about 0.1%. As opposed to this one that has almost a 3% mortality rate. Yes, most cases are not severe. But around 30% are and require hospitalization. That number for the flu is in the single digits, it varies each year, but I believe it's around 5% for the flu most of the time. 

The flu skews upwards for mortality rates too, with about 85% of deaths being elderly people. The flu is so widespread BECAUSE it's symptoms are so often mild. That's why it has such a low mortality rate. It's a numbers game. If this disease infected the same number of people as the flu does, the number of deaths would be in the tens of millions. 

You're making an argument where you're setting the parameters based on the number of infections we have now for Coronavirus (which is nothing compared to the flu), compared to the decades of exposure and hundreds of millions of cases of the flu. That's why this is such a big deal. Because it has the potential to be drastically worse than the flu, if allowed to spread. NOT because it's innately less dangerous than the flu, it's MUCH more dangerous. And that's hoping we don't get a bad mutation, which is common with Coronaviruses."

1. This virus has been demonstrably shown to be much more sever than the flu, The study you presented which addresses SARS, not this particular coronavirus,but you present it as if it does. That study actually states that by comparison, SARS was MODERATELY prone to mutation, not ""much less"" and Ignores that the portions of the genome that dictate mutation are apparently much different in this strain than SARS. |  

2. You state that this virus ""  this coronavirus is even magnitudes less deadly than your average seasonal flu strain which was around 0.1% mortality  ""  

3. Which again is completely false as even the WHO notes a death rate closer to 2-3%

Hong Kong University earned about *exactly* this at the end of their Lancet study when they studied the family cluster that presented to their Shenzhen facility.

First the mother of patient 4 acquired 2019 coronavirus even though she never went to Wuhan, but also the ten year old son of patient 4 —who did not display symptoms— had the virus.  The doctors only did a scan of the boy’s lungs because the parents were “nervous “.  Low and behold he had lung involvement, and tested positive for the virus.

The specifically warned of “walking pneumonia”.

Also an earlier paper talked about how since this virus can sometimes present with no upper respiratory symptoms, or negligible upper respiratory symptoms such as the sniffles and sneezing, etc that those cases are hard to detect.

You are downplaying the problem when lives are at stake. There hasn't been vaccination for other two coronavirus, SARS and MERS. SARS stopped because warm weather starved it out and respiratory viruses don't do well in summer season. MERS is still killing hundreds of people annually. There is no same promise for 2019-nCoV since it already jumped into African and SE Asian clusters, which is tropical area.

Maybe it's time for people like you to take this seriously and stop acting like it's nothing.

I've watched people lose their ever loving MINDS about everything under the sun from SARS, swine flu and ebola. I'm not saying epidemics aren't an issue and that people shouldn't exercise appropriate caution when travelling. But there's a difference between that and being a nasty prick about something that ultimately isn't going to affect you. Your coworker probably has a much greater risk getting measles from some unvaccinated child in her doctor's office than she does of getting the coronavirus. Not to mention, it's frankly rather shameful that this man is out here making this experience all about him when the chances of him or anyone else around him suffering is quite low. People are actually dying in Wuhan and Pierre McChump is out here, 3000+ miles away, going ""BUT WHAT ABOUT ME ME ME ME ME???""

And the bit about him getting angrier when you said you're willing to work from home for two weeks is what strikes me the most. This isn't about coronavirus or any of its risks at all. It's about him being an asshole and flexing his nonexistent knowledge about the world. He wants to piss you off, scare your coworker, and come off like a smug big man for protecting her pregnancy, and he's just angry that you won't play along with his hype like he wants you to.

I will say this though--if you only have 9 hrs in Hong Kong, you will not have enough time to collect your luggage, go through customs, and leave the airport to go exploring. Even if you did, it'd be very tight and I honestly wouldn't recommend it, as you'd have to come back to the airport, likely go through customs and security again, and then get to your terminal. Both exiting and re-entering the airport could eat up around 3 hrs of your time, and then there's the amt of time it'll take for you to commute to the city and get back and everything else. I mean, you could do it, but like I said, it'd take time and it'll be a rush. My recommendation is to just find a couple of books or download a TV show with lots of seasons and settle in at the airport, honestly."

Australia has upgraded its travel advice to reconsider all travel to China – and will be providing “assisted departures” to elderly and young Australians in Wuhan and Hubei province.

Prime minister Scott Morrison has described the coronavirus as “a serious and evolving situation” in a press conference in Canberra.

“The travel advice has been upgraded to reconsider all travel to China – the entire nation,” he says.

“We have taken a decision this morning to prepare a plan for an operation to provide some assisted departures for isolated and vulnerable Australians in Wuhan and the Hubei province.”

The evacuated Australians will then be quarantined in Christmas Island for up to 14 days.

But that is not for certain, and dependant on the medical advice.

“We cannot give a guarantee that this operation is able to succeed,” he says. “And I also want to stress very clearly that we may not be in a position if we’re able to do this on one occasion to do it on another occasion.”"

Every flu season, there are lots of respiratory ailments that are active - we currently have identified 21 different types of pathogens in Houston at this time. Influenza, pneumonias, rhinoviruses (what you think of as a common cold), pertussis, and coronaviruses are all different types of viruses you encounter every year. Most of them you will recover from in a few days, but for some people with lowered immunity, the elderly, infants, etc. it can be severe, and result in pneumonia.

This year, Harris County has had 3 deaths from the flu this season, one an infant, and one was a child with numerous health challenges. Some irresponsible gossip about the child's death has led to a lot of falsehoods about it being from the novel Corona virus, and it is NOT true. 

At any given moment between November and April, there are usually a couple of strains of influenza going around. Based on what has been reported early each season, the flu vaccine is usually directed at the type of influenza that is the one most likely to affect the highest number of people each year. That is usually what they call Type A for the season. Right now, there are FOUR different Type A influenzas in our area - Influenza A, Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H1(2009) which is identical to strain we saw in 2009, and Influenza A/H3. There is also one type of Influenza B we are seeing. 

So far this season, in Houston, we are mostly seeing cases of the A/H1(2009) and B types of influenza.

This new or ""novel"" virus is a corona virus (named for way this particular type of viruses are shaped), that there are usually 4 or 5 types of them going around at any given time. In Houston, we are seeing FOUR different Coronaviruses right now: Coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43. No businesses have been closed by the Health Department for any kind of Coronavirus. 

We are NOT seeing the novel Coronavirus in Houston. Novel just means it is a variety that has never been seen before, and most likely jumped species from an animal to humans. But what makes this virus something careful to watch is that it has a higher than normal mortality rate, and there is no vaccine. They are watching this one closely because when the same thing happened with MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) the mortality rate escalated to 35% of the people who were infected by the virus and developed pneumonia as a result. 

Nothing to panic about, but it is certainly a concern for global health."

They reported the first case in December 31 to the WHO and multiple countries received samples before the outbreak even happened. The reason why the WHO hasn't elevated this to a worldwide emergency is based on the low mortality rate of the virus (WHO is in China right now). Arresting people who talk about it is hard line but in my opinion understandable to prevent any misinformation or panic. The only way they might've mishandled it is by underestimating the contagiousness of the virus, but that's on Wuhan's local government. 

They've locked down an entire city to prevent the spread and are working on building temporary hospitals for better medical resources there. They're also forcing people to wear masks when they go outside. I don't see how any of this is being mishandled.

They also haven't been keeping quiet about the outbreak.

Also probably the Romulans kept it quiet for a long time, knowing the Romulans.

Not to introduce politics into a show about Future Space Communists, but we can see parallels to this *today.* When the coronavirus started to break out in China a few weeks ago, the local government initially tried to suppress any publicity about the virus before they started trying to find a cure. In all likelihood, the conditions inside the country are even worse than what's publicly known even now.

You might be compelled to think that the Chinese - and by extension, Romulan - government would want to ensure the wellbeing of their own people, but that's not the case. Authoritarian governments view their population as enemies almost as much as they do foreign governments. The best way to keep the populace pacified is to keep them just happy enough and to make them think that everything is under control.

So, the Tal Shiar discover that their star (or Hobus' star, whatever) is about to go supernova. Some quick calculations conclude that there's not enough time to evacuate everyone with all the resources they have available - Romulan warbirds weren't designed with emergency operations in mind the way Federation starships were, after all. The first thing they do is start suppressing information. The second thing they do is start evacuating all the important people.

As destruction nears, the evidence is now too strong to suppress or ignore. Evacuation is now public, and everyone is being told there's a way off the planets, both Romulus and Remus. The government knows this is a lie, however. Every ship has already picked up as many people as it can, and there's not enough time for a second run. Everyone left in the Romulus system is doomed - 900,000 individuals in all - and it probably consists mostly of dissidents anyway.

Enter Picard, who sees this as an environmental disaster and a change to build a bridge with the Romulans. We all know what happens after that."

I see numbers of mortality rates being reported around 2%-4% and it seems to lower over time but this concerns me since it is calculated based on \`Total Deaths : Total Infected\`. Of course, if infection is increasing exponentially, the rate will decrease for a short while as infection skyrockets and death lags behind.

Consider it takes 7 days to kill you (after the first detectable sign of symptoms), the mortality rate should be calculated not as \`Total Deaths Now : Total Infected Now\` but rather \`Total Deaths Now : Total Infected 7 days ago\`

That said, we know the historical data of infections vs deaths, [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak#cite_note-NHC_daily_reports-2)

The proper mortality rates would be as follows (for Mainland China):

&#x200B;

|Days to Kill You|Death : Infected|Mortality Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0|106 : 4515|2.3%|
|1|106 : 2744|3.9%|
|2|106 : 1975|5.4%|
|3|106 : 1287|8.2%|
|4|106 : 830|12.8%|
|5|106 : 571|18.6%|
|6|106 : 440|24.1%|
|7|106 : 291|36.4%|

The first ""cured"" case of Coronavirus happened on the 24th (4 days ago) so we can assume they had been infected since the start and were just then getting out of the infected stage, that means the symptoms last approximately 8 days.

If we assume the virus is most severe at the half way point, and if you get past the half life of symptoms (day 4) you are likely to recover, then we can assume the fatalities most likely occur also 4 days after symptoms show, which means the mortality rate is much more likely to be around the 12-13% mark than the reported 2% mark (which was reported 3% yesterday and 4% the day before, and so on—it is falling each day because the infection rate is exponentially climbing which is artificially inflating the denominator, this is producing invalid numbers and giving a false sense of security.)

For reference, SARS had a fatality rate estimated around 14% and it looks like this one may also be right around that mark based on the data when accounting for time (fatality speed)."

Correct me if I'm wrong but coronavirus symptoms present as a really, really bad pneumonia and is super contagious on top.  The deaths have been in China, and the cases outside seem to be a bit milder with some being cured.  Perhaps the logic is that in China the poor air quality and large smoker population exacerbates the pneumonia symptoms to a deadly point.  Added to that the massive strain put on their medical resources right now and it's what has led to the more severe cases there that are seemingly being well-managed elsewhere.  Maybe they feel the local emergency declarations and travel restrictions are the best course for now.  Maybe they know fuck all and have massively underestimated this thing.

>In August 2018, Zheng entered the United States on a J-1 visa and conducted cancer-cell research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston from Sept. 4, 2018, to Dec. 9, 2019. It is alleged that on Dec. 9, 2019, Zheng stole 21 vials of biological research and attempted to smuggle them out of the United States aboard a flight destined for China.  Federal officers at Logan Airport discovered the vials hidden in a sock inside one of Zheng’s bags, and not properly packaged.  It is alleged that initially, Zheng lied to officers about the contents of his luggage, but later admitted he had stolen the vials from a lab at Beth Israel.  Zheng stated that he intended to bring the vials to China to use them to conduct research in his own laboratory and publish the results under his own name.

Yeah, despite the headline the official didn’t dismiss this, just said there is no risk to the BC public, presumably because this person is now back in China.

Changjiang Daily (Reporter Huang Qi Liu Chenwei) The reporter learned from the Municipal Health and Medical Commission that starting from the 28th, Wuhan City will add 8 new detection institutions based on the existing 10 new coronavirus detection institutions.

　　At the same time, Wuhan City urgently dispatched 40,000 kits for the designated testing institutions in the city, and will soon reship 60,000 copies. 13,500 copies of the new coronavirus nucleic acid test kit have been issued.

　　The city's average daily virus detection capacity increased 10 times in 6 days

　　From January 22nd to 27th, the city's detection capacity has been increased from 200 copies per day to 2,000 copies per day. The 10 testing organizations in the city have been ""speeding up"" and ""racing"" the virus.

　　In order to meet the needs of the prevention and control situation and increase the speed of testing, Wuhan City, upon requesting relevant higher authorities, has designated Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Union Hospital, Hubei Provincial People's Hospital, Wuhan The University of South China Hospital, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, Wuhan No. 3 Hospital, and Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted new coronavirus nucleic acid tests. From January 23 to 27, a total of 4,086 samples have been tested, of which 712 were positive.

　　The head of the relevant department of the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee said that in principle, all 10 institutions can detect nearly 2000 samples per day, but due to the high pathogenicity of the virus, scientific researchers have to gradually familiarize themselves with pre-tests. As a result, the number of test samples will not be 2000 per day from the beginning and will gradually increase.

　　Beginning on the 28th, there will be eight more testing institutions designated by Wuhan, including Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, Jianghan District Disease Control Center, Tongkou District Disease Control Center, Caidian District Disease Control Center, Jiangxia District Disease Control Center, Huanghua District Control center, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Huada Biotechnology (Wuhan) Co., Ltd.

　　Citizens should not panic because of rising diagnostic data

　　The epidemic data released on the 27th showed that 892 newly diagnosed cases were newly added in Wuhan, while 80 cases were confirmed in Wuhan the day before. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan has increased sharply in just one day. It is rumored that Wuhan has entered a virus outbreak period.

　　The number of confirmed diagnoses in our city has increased significantly, largely because of the ""expanding and speeding up"" of testing institutions.

　　Professor Wang Lin, director of the Department of Laboratory Medicine of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, also said that the recent increase in the number of diagnoses has a greater relationship with the speed of testing. At present, many hospitals have the ability to carry out the detection of pathogenic nucleic acids in related samples, and the speed of detection has increased significantly. The PCR laboratory of Xiehe Hospital's Laboratory has already carried out new coronavirus nucleic acid detection in the hospital. Currently, 200 nucleic acid detection projects can be carried out daily More than people, can effectively provide a basis for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. She reminded that don't just focus on the simple rise in numbers. Early diagnosis and early isolation will definitely help prevent the spread of the disease."

That study also noted that by January 24, some 1,287 cases had been confirmed, resulting in 41 deaths. Those raw numbers yield an alarming mortality rate of over 3 percent. (For what it's worth, the R0 for the Black Death in medieval Europe was also around 3, but the mortality rate after disease onset was close to 100 percent.)

A preprint by British researchers analyzing the epidemic in Wuhan estimated that only about 5 percent of infections had been actually identified by January 24 which suggests that about 26,000 people were then suffering from the disease. If that estimate is correct, a rough calculation would yield a 0.15 percent mortality rate for the Wuhan virus. Parsing the latest reported cases and deaths yields essentially the same mortality rate. The coronavirus mortality rate is a bit above the seasonal flu rate in the U.S., but not hugely so.’

The Ministry also said that previously the team of the Spanish technician was concentrated in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, about a thousand miles from Wuhan, so they were not at the origin of the outbreak of coronavirus when it began to spread.
The Wuhan Zall has been out of his city since January 2 and therefore has passed the maximum incubation period to be monitored, the statement continues.
The Advisory Group Monitoring Coronavirus in Andalusia will monitor, while reiterating a message of reassurance to the population as the team members, players and coaching staff, do not have any symptoms linked to the outbreak.

Since last Thursday can not leave or enter Wuhan as it is in quarantine for the virus, since the Chinese authorities estimated in fourteen days the incubation time of it, which has already caused 106 deaths and a total of 4515 confirmed cases throughout the Asian country.”

On January 25, the WeChat Security Center issued the ""Announcement on the Special Control of Rumors Related to New Coronavirus Pneumonia"".  The ""Announcement"" stated that the new type of coronavirus pneumonia is continuing to spread throughout the country, causing widespread concern in the society.  At the same time, all kinds of ""rumored"" and ""heared"" rumors and information continue to stimulate everyone's panic.  The ""Criminal Law Amendment (9)"" clearly stipulates: ""The fabrication of false dangers, epidemics, disasters, and police information is spread on information networks or other media, or it is known that such false information is intentionally spread on information networks or other media.  Those who seriously disrupt the social order shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, detention or control of less than 3 years; if they cause serious consequences, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of 3 to 7 years. ""

WeChat will resolutely and continuously crack down on rumor-like information.  At present, professional third-party rumor removal agencies have been introduced to rumor rumors on the platform; and in accordance with relevant national laws and regulations and the Tencent WeChat Software License and Service Agreement, WeChat Personal Account Use Specifications, and other relevant agreement specifications, the content of violations of information  Deletion processing, and stepped punishment of violating accounts according to the degree of violation: including, but not limited to, limiting or permanently blocking accounts or account functions.

WeChat will set up a special group to clean up rumors related to ""new coronavirus pneumonia"" and continue to strengthen the rectification. Tencent's authenticity verification platform will also conduct real-time rumors about new coronavirus pneumonia; users are also welcome to complain about related rumors.  WeChat Safety Center reminds: Be extra calm and rational before the epidemic situation. Users should learn about the epidemic information from disease control or medical institutions and authoritative news media. The relevant epidemic prevention information is subject to the official website of the provincial and municipal health and health committees. Do not listen to rumors and increase  Unnecessary psychological burden, do not believe rumors, do not spread rumors, improve alertness and recognition.  (Reporter of CCTV, Sun Jiwei of CCTV)"

Less than 3 months ago, scientists at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security ran a simulation with a Coronavirus from a bat similar to the Wuhan Flu that eventually kills 65 million people.

Here is the article, it is worth a read:

https://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-simulated-coronavirus-pandemic-deaths-2020-1

The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security worked in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to wargame the scenario, called “Event 201.” They even have videos of things like artificial newsreels to go with the simulation.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLw-Q8X174

This isn’t the only one, they have hours of videos talking about the specifics of the simulation and government responses. Perhaps there is some interesting info in there on potential government actions if someone feels like mining info.

As for how this relates to the original conspiracy I posted? Hard to say. People have been concerned about a coronavirus outbreak worse than SARS for a long time, and Bill Gates has been saying for years that a plague like that is his biggest fear in the near future. It could literally be a coincidence. The movie Contagion also had it come from a bat, there are scientific reasons why it is more likely to come from one.

It would have to be administered a week or two before. Vaccines are relatively easy to make, if often expensive to develop.

The fact that there were no mass vaccinations beforehand lets us know either this was indeed accidentally released, or that the very few they wish to survive (outside of those that naturally endure the illness) were probably vaccinated in secret. It could also just be because of China's notorious carelessness in these areas (I'm sure US and others are as bad). Developing a bio weapon based on a virus there's no antidote/cure for is the most insanely irresponsible thing that exists military circles. We freak out about North Korea or Iran having nukes, but have zero guidelines about who biological weapons. I can't think that nuclear fallout is less scary than a weaponized bug that could kill large percentages of human population.

There's no cure for coronavirus, rhinovirus etc. Of there were you can bank that the big pharma would have been cashing on it the day it was approved. Steroids have been experimented with with mixed results. Vit C goes a long way, but can't be patented so therefore can't be marketed like a drug.

So in short, the fact that we haven't seen or heard mention of vaccinations really doesn't have much bearing on whether it was fully weaponized yet. It could very well been 100% ready to go, with no vaccine."

The German man was infected by a Chinese colleague who had flown in from Shanghai where she lives for work training. She was never in Wuhan. She was infected by her parents who visited her from their hometown of Wuhan. 

She got sick on her flight home and immediately sought medical treatment when she landed in China. In other words, she only tested positive for the virus upon returning to China.

I couldn’t find out when she entered Germany but they (the German and Chinese employees) basically were in close contact of each other on the 21st and she left Germany on the 23rd of Jan. nCoV has an incubation period of 1-14 days where carriers can be asymptomatic for days and still are capable of spreading the virus. 

So it’s tough to know who has it and who does not. Temperature checks at border crossings does little to detect potential carriers.

The question is what are good conditions - and while there has been articles with scary titles like this one [SARS can survive outside of the body for weeks](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/sars-virus-can-survive-for-weeks-outside-body-who-1.475387) - if you read the article you note the following: 

> The SARS virus can survive for hours on common surfaces outside the human body, and up to four days in human waste, according to the research carried out in laboratories in Hong Kong, Japan and Germany.
At sub-zero temperatures, such as in a regular refrigerator, the virus showed only ""minimal reduction"" after three weeks. 

[Here](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-new-coronavirus-what-we-do-and-dont-know-2020012518747) you can read about what is known and un-known about the new coronavirus. These types of viruses usually need close human contact - and are similar in survival outside of the body to SARS (which was if I understand correctly also a corona virus). They state: 
>While we don’t yet understand the particulars of how this virus spreads, coronaviruses usually spread through droplets containing large particles that typically can only be suspended in the air for three to six feet before dissipating.

Taking [this site](https://www.reference.com/business-finance/long-cargo-ship-china-united-states-b7c6214e137c2e0a) as a reference (not sure how reliable it is, but I wouldn't see a reason why it would be vastly overestimating the time) we get: 

>The amount of time it takes for a cargo ship to travel between China and the United States depends on the exact route and the speed of the ship. In most cases, these journeys take between two weeks and a month to complete. 
>In addition to the length of time it takes to physically cross the ocean, handling, customs and other procedures can add significantly to the amount of time necessary to ship goods across the Pacific. It can take as many as 33 days to prep a shipment for transit, and once the ship arrives in the United States, it can take six more days before the cargo is released.

Rice and other non-perishable food is not being shipped and processed with priority. Being afraid of contamination through shipments of such products is not rational. Being afraid of contamination through shipments of anything other than infected meat is not rational I would say."

The fundamental problem isn't ""the available masks aren't being distributed to the right people"", but rather ""there aren't as many masks as people want available right now"".  Ultimately, fixing that is up to the manufacturers.

It does look like the manufacturers are ramping up production:

2020-01-28,fut-,news,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ev4dbz/4500_infected_with_coronavirus_100_dead_shortage/ffuk0f3/,"There's a lot of confusion and misinformation spreading around here, and plenty of new folks showing up with questions. I'm not a doctor, but I'll try to summarize some pertinent points:

  * Coronaviruses are a ubiquitous family of viruses that are have been with us for a long time, and are responsible for a significant proportion of all cases of the common cold. That said, like the influenza virus, they have the potential to mutate into something potentially more lethal, as was the case during the [1918 flu pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu).
  
  * Although we are pretty darn good at dealing with bacterial infections, antiviral drugs are still in their infancy, and we **do not** have a convincing way to treat coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, influenza, and the like. There are some antivirals on the market that are sometimes given to folks with virus-caused respiratory conditions, but the benefits are modest at best, and some research suggests they don't do much at all. So in that sense, we are not necessarily more ready for a viral pandemic today than we were back in 1918. Good hygiene and our own immune systems are our best bets.
  
  * The specific 2019-nCoV coronavirus strain was first observed in December 2019 as the authorities were investigating an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases among the workers at a meat market in Wuhan, China. It is entirely possible that the virus is not actually novel, and that it is more widespread than observed - we weren't really looking for it until now. But it is also possible that this is where it started, likely due to animal-to-human transmission. Human-to-human transmission appears to be happening, too, with multiple people in China and a handful of travelers returning to the US and to Europe testing positive.
  
  * There is profound uncertainty around how infectious or dangerous the virus is; anybody claiming otherwise is likely full of it. Part of the problem is that in many cases, the symptoms are probably pretty mild and indistinguishable from the common cold, so it is difficult to know how many people might have had it - most wouldn't be seeking medical help. There are tens of millions of people worldwide who come down every winter with a flu; this year is no different and most won't get tested for coronavirus. What we know is that there are 106 verified deaths and around 4,295 lab-confirmed cases, giving us one potential but uncertain upper bound on mortality (2.5%, trending down from 4%). The lower bound is largely unknown. If hundreds of thousands had the virus, then even hundreds of deaths wouldn't necessarily be worse than the flu or the common cold. The number of confirmed cases is climbing fairly steeply, around 500-1,000 a day for the past four days and evidently accelerating.
  
  * The Internet loves rumors, so there's a lot of speculation about a potential cover-up. In principle, that's a distinct possibility - governments around the globe have a rich history of downplaying risks to avoid panic or protect the tourism industry. That said, it would be hard to succeed. China is not North Korea: they have broad access to the Internet, cell phones are ubiquitous, and there are millions of foreigners living there. There almost certainly are far more infections than confirmed with lab tests; but if the disease was a whole lot more lethal than claimed, we would probably have reputable reports by now.

  * Pandemic scares in the West happen every 2-3 years: SARS, MERS, West Nile, swine flu, avian flu, Zika, Ebola, and so on. Most of them turn out to be of no consequence. This does not mean that this one will also fizzle out; at the same time, any plans you devise must take into account the 90%+ probability that it's a false alarm - and that the whole scenario is gonna play out again in the not-too-distant future.
  
  * Until we know more, the best way to reduce your odds of getting infected is simple: avoid crowds. This includes public transit / air travel, grocery stores, schools, workplaces, churches, parties, sporting events, healthcare facilities, and so on. Unfortunately, this is not practical for most - but if you can take some paid time off, it might not be a bad plan. Skipping some unimportant events or travel may be a solid precaution, too. Disposable N95 respirators offer some protection when fitted properly - read the instructions! - as does washing your hands and trying not to touch your face (we do this a lot more than we think).   

  * It's interesting to note that the other coronavirus-caused would-be-pandemic - SARS - also originated in China under similar circumstances. The 2002-2003 outbreak involved 7,083 known cases and 648 deaths in China and Hong Kong (~10% case mortality), with hundreds more diagnosed in Canada and in the US. It led to large-scale containment efforts worldwide, with fairly extreme measures taken across much of Asia. In the end, the outbreak fizzled out, and no new cases have been reported since 2004. It's possible for a more virulent strain to wreak more havoc, though.

Please let me know if there's anything worth adding or correcting here."

PETALING JAYA: The Health Ministry has confirmed three more cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), bringing the total number of such cases in Malaysia to seven.

A 51-year-old pharmacist at a drugstore in Namdaemun Market, central Seoul, on Friday morning, a 51-year-old pharmacist said.

Some Chinese tourists buy only a small quantity to wear while in Korea, but many bought it on a scale of 100 units this morning alone, adding that seven people bought more than 100 items and are now out of stock.

Chinese tourists are rushing to buy masks as fears are growing over a new outbreak of coronavirus infection (pneumonia) in Wuhan, China’s. As mass purchases by Chinese people overlapped amid rising domestic demand, mask shortages occurred in some local stores.

The Namdaemun market, three pharmacies near Myeongdong in Seoul and two convenience stores, which were confirmed earlier in the day, had already ran out of mask inventory. I prepared a mask every day for a few days, but it is sold out before lunch,"" said Park, 23, a convenience store employee at a hotel in central Seoul where many Chinese tourists visit. At convenience store GS25 during the holiday period, mask sales jumped 413 percent from the same period a year ago.

Some pharmacies in Myeong-dong had additional massively equipped masks after experiencing hoarding during the Lunar New Year holidays. A pharmacist at a pharmacy said, ""The big hands of China already took a vacation during the Spring Festival and bought all the masks. I think they will keep looking for them for the time being, so I have a new supply today.""

The Chinese hoarding masks in Korea is said to be the main reason why it is difficult to get them there. ""We heard from tourists that the mask factories also stopped because of the prolonged Lunar New Year holiday due to pneumonia,"" said an official at the B drugstore in Myeong-dong.

On top of this, it is also known that Chinese social networking services have spread the perception that Korean masks have a better ability to prevent infection.

The Korean mask industry seems to be perplexed by the untimely boom. ""Millions of orders are being placed in China,"" a mask maker official said. ""We had about 210 million in stock until recently, but now we have about 20 million."""

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html

>Q: How does the virus spread?
A: This virus probably originally emerged from an animal source but now seems to be spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so. It’s not clear yet how easily 2019-nCoV spreads from person-to-person. When person-to-person spread has occurred with MERS and SARS, it is thought to have happened mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. Spread of MERS and SARS between people has generally occurred between close contacts."

    - for first time seeing analysts excited about other products, watch and airpods as being real drivers of bottom line revenue!!!
    - interesting note from Bloomberg tech reporter ""Apple’s new revenue strategy isn’t a bad one. It’s, basically, sell the customer an iPhone every three to five years, and make a bunch of money in the years between by selling them a new Apple Watch or AirPods (which only last about three years tops before you need a new pair -- batteries!) and services. If a user subscribes to all of Apple’s services for two years straight, that’s about equal to revenue from a new iPhone. So in those cases, if that user doesn’t buy a new iPhone for a couple years, it’s not a big deal.""
    - apples done so well lately that the average analysts has a target price 5% below what apple is currently trading at
    - they manufacture iphones 400 km from the center of the coronavirus outbreak, see if this is mentioned, also about 18% of apple revenue so China matters
    - want to see what their effective tax rate is

**Numbers:**

    - stocks almost back to record highs before reporting, after reporting it shot way past!!
    - 1Q Revenue is $91.8B vs estimates of $88.38B!!!!!!
    - 1Q EPS is $4.99 vs estimates of$4.56!!!!!
    - wearables was $10 vs $7.3 last year( apple just continues to create $10+ billion dollar business every 3-5 years. Use to be that only MSFT could do that and GOOG spent heavily trying to do that
    - iphone revenue for 1Q is $55.97
    - service revenue for 1Q is $12.72
    - declines in both mac($7.1 vs $7.4 last year) and iPad sales($6 vs %6.7 last year)
    - iphone sales up everywhere except Japan

**Numbers that really impress**

    - Cash/Equivalents have doubled from last year, that funds a lot of money loosing streaming shows
    - keeping in mind they bought back $37B in stock this year
    - almost $100B in term debt

Sri Lanka has one of the greatest public health care systems in the region, especially considering we actually provide universal health care compared to countries like USA. And we have better stats than most parts of the world thanks to the fact that our health sector employees working tirelessly (most of them) and the citizens being mostly responsible and health conscious people.

Having said that, statements like this one made by the GMOA are just ridiculous. They are infamous for coming out of the woodwork for their benefit only, and I think EVERYONE in the country knows it by now. It does not reflect the stance of all all doctors.

u/aboyislost and u/CleverD3vil \- well, the state sector medical workers can't exactly ditch work and get lost. It's the job. You say nothing can make you put yourself in danger and most people would agree with that. But in the hospital setup; doctors, nurses, attendant.. even security guards are willing to throw there lives in the line to help someone else in MAJORITY of the cases. I guess it is one of the personality traits needed to go for these jobs in the first place. But other factors like family time, good pay etc all matter.

Short story:

One time we had a patient come with Rabies in a hospital far from Colombo. Rabies is one disease where if you present with the signs of illness, you are most likely a goner. No medicine at that point. Every fluid including spit, vomit and other secretions can be infectious. Patients like that should be placed in isolation.

Unfortunately, not all government hospital wards have isolation rooms. And government hospital are very crowded (thanks to the free health care which people love to exploit more than anything else) So this patient was in the distant end of the ward until death. After death, the entire area had to be disinfected and cleaned because of an inch of vomit and urine and spit all around the bed and a doctor had to declare the death. And the doctor whose patient it was didn't say a word about going to that patient with all the infection risk. Ideally, proper protection should be there. If you are stepping into an inch of vomit, at least boots must be available. But they weren't. Mask, gloves and a borrowed apron were the maximum protection he got. He had to soak his shoes in disinfectant for the rest of the day and wash his stethoscope with alcohol, but that was the most protection available at the time, out of Colombo. He didn't think twice about going there and most of the staff were no different. The only person who was gave that patient a wide berth and was kept away by the staff was a pregnant staffer. Everyone else basically knew and accepted those risks.

It's a bit drastic to say fuck them and they don't deserve anything. I don't agree with the GMOA stance about a raise. It's purely political. The actual doctors and staff wouldn't ever ask for a raise in this crisis or any crisis for that matter. BUT what would help us all is if doctors and the staff had the proper equipment to handle the situation. It is once again usual in an emergency for supplies to run short especially like how face masks are going for Rs 500 now. Panicking people make crises worse. There definitely aren't enough face masks for 21 million people in the country. And when something unexpected like this comes a long, we should be prepared in at least the big hospitals in the country.

As far as this new strain of the coronavirus goes, don't panic. Avoid public transport and crowded areas where possible. If you are ill, get medicine and stay at home to avoid making other people sick. Just because you have the similar symptoms doesn't mean you have coronavirus - can be just a common cold. Also, use the same sanitation methods taught since grade 1: wash hands with soap after going to washroom, before eating, travelling in public transport. If you can get a n90/n95/n100 facemask somehow (should be short stocked now) wear it in public if you are uncomfortable. Wearing a face mask doesn't give you 100% protection. And don't get hysterical about dying - the cases that we see and hear about are the susceptible ones. Like people who don't catch a cold easily, there might be people who won't get coronavirus. And there are those who wouldn't get  ill even if you did. Death is usually in people whose immunity is already compromised by an existing condition.

Didn't mean to write an essay, but that's it. Stay calm and stay safe. Cheers :)"

Currently I'd say there is minimal to no concern about flying to Ireland. there are no recorded cases in the UK or Ireland, nor New York. 

Those in the aviation industry should be being extra careful, eg making sure planes are thoroughly cleaned after all flights, especially those that have been flying to China, and it's highly unlikely someone infected would be on a flight from NYC to Ireland. 

Excersising reasonable caution should further limit the risks, eg dont touch surfaces and then your face in the airport without being sure to have washed you're hands (that's being extra careful) 

If you're young and healthy you are also currently at a minimal risk even if you do catch this coronavirus, it would likely only affect you like any other common cold or flu. 

However, continue to pay attention to the news. RO for this virus is most certainly above 1, which means it won't fizzle out, and scientists have been expecting it will continue unabated for anywhere between the next two weeks to three months. More and more cases will likely arise internationally, meaning more caution may be needed, and if local epidemics break out anywhere around where you may be travelling, obviously reconsider. 

At current I will reiterate you're risk is minimal to non existent however. Go, enjoy your trip, and take a little extra caution!"

First, I don't believe in an anarchism that has worse material conditions than our present state of affairs. So if you're asking me from some kind of post-revolution (...or post-apocalyptic) primitivist state of anarchism? Well that's like asking what would folks a few centuries ago do about coronavirus? Well they would make inept decisions and it would probably burn through a lot of old people and it would be a horrific and destabilizing mess. Although, granted the earlier premise, it would probably be a less well-connected world, and thus wouldn't spread regionally or globally as easily.

The germ theory of disease doesn't just like, go away because you believe so strongly in anarchism and you're an anarchist and maximum autonomy for all, ACAB. Virology would still be relevant. Would post-civvies agree with me, then?

Quarantine is an acceptable method of addressing a pandemic, and if that conflicts with my anarchism, then sorry not sorry? However, oppressing certain subsets of the population over others - not including the *actual* quarantine subset which is a *rational and ethical subset* \- under quarantine conditions is not acceptable without a rational consideration (e.g. doctors and medical specialists would be able to move around under quarantine conditions according to their duties). We are dealing with what seems like a nearly or very much exponential genetic virus and we're a herd animal species. Quarantine is a scientific and just measure to such a threat, as are vaccines.

I personally envision that the research and development efforts on combatting the virus would be open source, and some of academia is a little bit, although a lot of it is not and I would hope we oppose that. I think there's a natural incentive to reduce the impact of the pandemic, and we need not look much more deeply than an even weak concept of mutual aid. People will want to help tackle this. A lot of resources would be directed to combat it, and information would be transparent but rational. We have the technology to give voice to experts, and it should be experts and good communicators (I'm talking a proper logical AND subset there).

Likewise, the vaccine would not be privatized, although it might still be expensive, since that's a question of production and material conditions. I don't have an answer for that, but I can't plan for all externalities.

There are cameras everywhere, so of course we are seeing videos of social distress, minor panic, etc. It's the early stages of a potential pandemic. It's scary. You \[particularly if 'you' lives at ground zero\] could die. People you know could die. Some very brave medical staff are insanely overworked, because *super-abundance doesn't exist*, not even under an anarchism that isn't also science fiction, but I would hope we do the best that we can and pump relief to them. They are heroes and their wellbeing matters too, so lets shuttle in volunteer replacements. These human moments and dramas will still exist, just like IdiotsInCars would (although maybe it would be a more ecological IdiotsOnBikes majority).

Externally, and zoomed out, as most redditors' view of the situation will be, this may not seem all that different from what's happening in reality. Despite capitalism, I am sure lots of good people are doing good things in the face of this, and that's the human spirit I want to reward better in that flavour-of-anarchism-i-don't-know-what I believe is achievable.

Of course, one reason I may not be best buds with all anarchists is that I do think humanity needs government, they just don't need state, and despite being occasional synonyms, I'm choosing to differentiate the two in my meaning. So there would be governments and there would be organizations, and they would have ""responses"" just like similar abstract entities do under a capitalist or authoritarian framework.

As well, I wasn't 100% sure when I read your post if you meant what a hypothetical anarchist ""global society"" would do against this coronavirus, or a local commune's response (much more limited, the response would be), or the random scattered anarchists that happen to browse reddit?

I feel like in your own small way you are *already* contributing in an ""anarchist"" way with what you do on Reddit. Sharing truthful information or correcting misinformation. Contributing your own scientific prowess to an aspect of it (good communicator, perhaps?). Helping raise non-profit money for relief in innovative ways? It's a much tinier subset of people who can do anything very direct action. But I suppose if you're in China, you could look into organizations taking volunteers? The potential reach and potency of all these actions vary, but they can all be positive."

So to me it seems that heating to 56°C for 30+ minutes with a couple hours of drying out time combined with the hostile absorptive surface of the mask may be enough.  Then again, I only think this is suitable as a last resort.

I have gotten a type of coronavirus before. I have a VERY weak immune system because of I had a kidney transplant. Yes, I got very, very sick, but I recovered fine and I am old (46)!

You are young, you seem healthy enough and you might have a cold. You should have a thermometer on hand, though. It is impossible to feel for your own temperature. Please go get a thermometer. A normal temperature can range between 97 to 99.

 Go see your Dr. if you have cold/flu symptoms AND a fever. You should only worry about a fever if it goes over 100°. Some say 102°. Also, if your chest is congested and you are coughing up phlegm, you are ok as long as it is translucent with no color. If it is yellow/green, go to the Dr. to see if they want to give you antibiotics (usually, they won't)

Do some good self-care: Rest as much as you can, drink lots of fluid (no caffeine) and eat a cookie. Or 5.

Cookies solve everything. EVERYTHING."

2020-01-28,Resident_Jack,neoliberal,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/ev2386/discussion_thread/fftsmg6/,"The new coronavirus has been getting a ton of attention recently, but nowhere more so than in China itself.  The virus is the only topic of discussion here and there has been a genuine widespread panic forming.  It was quiet in the first few days, but things have steadily been shutting down and people are leaving their homes less.  The wrongest time I've ever picked to go on vacation.

I left for Nanjing right when the infection began spreading out of Wuhan.  [The first night and next morning, the city had people walking around, visiting stores and tourist attractions and half the people weren't even wearing masks.](http://imgur.com/a/acjrpdO) This was the area around Confucius temple on the 24th, right after Nanjing reported it's first case.

The next morning I went to do some work at a cafe, and while I was there, the police started building barricades around the area.  [By noon they had blocked off the entrances to the entire area around the temple and were doing temperatures and checks at the only entrance.](http://imgur.com/a/vvh8YUT) As I'm walking around I realize they've closed down whole swathes of the city.

[Here's some more things to do around Nanjing.  All of them were closed.](http://imgur.com/a/nFLcDUX)

I eventually found an Irish pub near my hotel and started shooting the shit with the owner.  He's a Scot and an old timer in Nanjing.  The bar hasn't closed a day in the last 12 years, but business was slow.  I was the only one there.  We talked about the virus and the growing legend of Flora, before talking about all the closings.

All good things must end and the police call, telling the owner they have to shut down the whole area indefinitely. The only thing they're leaving open is shopping malls because. . . Whatever. Obviously this man isn't having it and asks to see some documentation.  The police have way too much power in China and they get spooked easily, so instead of getting the documents they threatened to call the supervisor of the area and give him a subtle ""you really don't want to get on his radar."" Message received, the bar closes and the owner is visibly distraught.  He just took a blow to the gut.

I pay, go outside and, get stopped by the police who take my temperature for the fifth time that day.  I think it might be clear, but I think this is a massive overreaction.  They've entirely shut down a city of 10 million over what was then 7 cases.  I decided to give up and go to Shanghai.

----

[Shanghai was better despite the men in full on biohazard suits doing screenings at Shanghai train station on exit.](http://imgur.com/a/SQoA6Qt). Like 15x more cases in Shanghai too.  Around 100.

[The Bund is normally packed but it was empty, and unsurprisingly, every museum was closed, but the areas are still alive and shops aren't closing.](http://imgur.com/a/LIwesa0)  Now, my only plan for Shanghai was to meet up with some friends and go drinking.  Clubs are still open, photos finished uploading, so it's time for me to get drunk and forget how shitty the rest of this vacation has been."

I work in a healthcare profession, and we are starting to hear about people presenting to emergency because they sat beside a person that was talking in ""Chinese"" on the bus that looked like they might be sick, or they heard someone sneeze while they were at the Asian superstore and they wanted to be ""extra safe"". Another asian coworker of mine told me that a patient wanted to see someone else because she heard of the Chinese flu. My coworker is Canadian born, is of Korean discent, and speaks only English.

Even with friends. We had a get-together over the weekend, and I brought up Coronavirus, and a friend asked me and my girlfriend (the only two Asians in the room) to make sure to tell them if we're sick. I was kinda flabbergasted, but my girlfriend handled it well and we all gave our friend a jokingly hard time for being racist. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little bothered by it, even if it was in a joking way from a friend. 

This is just anecdotal for sure. And I get that it's just a couple dumb people. As an Canadian born Asian though, you just get discouraged. I prefer to try to see the best in people, and I can understand that these people are scared and just don't have a good enough understanding about what is going on. But whenever these situations come up, you can't help but think that there a proportion of people that you walk past on the street with this racism simmering under the surface just waiting for whatever ""justification"" it can find to galvanize that person against you. And that this proportional is higher than you would have expected from first blush."

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

I am right there with you as someone who takes immunosuppressant drugs and uses public transportation regularly. People are generally NASTY and woefully ignorant about hygiene. Also, I’ve read way too many sci-fi stories about pandemics not to feel a lil nervy about rapidly spreading disease lol.

I happen to have a virologist in the family helping me monitor the Coronavirus outbreak and I’ve pasted the resources she gave me verbatim at the bottom of this comment. The best things you can do right now in terms of prevention are stay up-to-date on the CDC’s reporting and regulations, wash your hands regularly, and avoid travel/airports when possible.

I hope this helps ease some of your worry.

[This](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706717_1)  article is paywalled, so I apologize, but from the abstract it seems that SARS vaccines have thus far been elusive.

>Hong Kong(CNN) Hong Kong announced Tuesday that it was closing many of its border crossings with mainland China in a bid to contain the Wuhan coronavirus, as the death toll from the outbreak topped 100, with more than 4,600 cases in the mainland.

>The move to close off Hong Kong comes after intense pressure from lawmakers and medical unions, one of which had threatened to strike if the border was not shut. 

>On Monday, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a level 3 alert warning against ""all nonessential travel to China"" -- its highest alert on a scale of 1 to 3.

However, we can’t use raw numbers to compare lethality of two different diseases. 

For example, in the 2017-2018 flu season the US had an estimated 21,000,000 medical visits because of the flu and 61,000 deaths. A lot for sure. In fact it was one of the worst flu seasons for the US. With these numbers we can calculate a case-fatality of about .29%. 

This novel coronavirus currently has a case-fatality of about 2.3%. 

If the coronavirus was to spread here and infect as many people as the 2017-2018 flu did, then it’s 2.3% case fatality would result in the death of about 493,000 people in the US alone. An 8 times increase compared to the flu. 

To put that into perspective, that would result in being in the top 10 leading causes of death for that year for Americans. 

Of course, socioeconomic differences, public health response etc would likely change the characteristics of the epidemic here and hopefully such an event would be contained, but there are thousands of healthcare workers, researchers, and scientist working hard to prevent and stop things like the coronavirus because of how much of a burden it could be on the global population."

-wash your hands after touching anything in public. Things like payment machines, any sort of door handle, any kind of money. Avoid touching things as much as you can. Wash them again anyway before eating and after using any facilities.

-do not touch your face, including your ears or eyes or nose. don't rub your eyes, don't rest your hand on your chin.

-wear clothes at most once or twice, or have a hoodie you wear and then hang up and not wear around anywhere else.

-purchase viral-grade lysol and spray your bags and jacket with them if you can't wash them every day. Use anti-viral wipes on door handles and light switches. 

-coronavirus doesn't survive long on surfaces outside the body, probably less than a day. But people do come and go more frequently than that, so always consider this and keep it in mind

-even if you don't feel sick, you may be in the beginning stages and spreading it, or you may be 'asymptomatic' where you're infected but you don't feel any side effects and not know. If you casually clear your throat or sneeze, do so into the elbow of your arm. Do not use your fist. 

-don't eat or drink in public, even if it's using a drinking straw. Avoid fast food or any open food in any circumstances. If someone around you has just coughed or sneezed, move away. 



-use surgery masks. N95 masks are hard to come by and expensive, but surgical masks- while not able to kill the virus- do at least stop physically the drops from being inhaled. To wear it, have the **blue side outwards** and the white side inwards. Put the strip side upwards over your nose, then pinch it to conform it to your nose. Then tug the bottom edge, center, downwards over your chin, expanding the little folds like an accordion. If you need to remove it to eat or something, don't just slide it down onto your chin, remove it from your ear or you'll fuck up the nose bridge crease. replace it every day, at least.

-simply don't go outside or go to crowded places. Please, take a sick day if you feel bad, you should have sick days in your employee vacation plan.

-I'm hearing unsubstantiated rumours that those who got the flu shot this year may have a boost against this disease's severity, but since it takes a week to kick in, go get the shot RIGHT NOW. 

Back during  H1N1/H1N4/SARS, these helped a lot. good luck, folks."

Q: Am I at risk for novel coronavirus from a package or products shipping from China?

There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS and SARS). 2019-nCoV is more genetically related to SARS than MERS, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. **Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods.** Information will be provided on the 2019 Novel Coronavirus website as it becomes available."

I don't know what ABC is gaining by ""establishing this discovery"", but it's another publication article  in a long line of disinformation for profit.

You do not need to ""recreate"" the virus in order to study vaccination potential. The genome data IS 
 the virus. And it's optimized for computer-based simulation so that a live-subject is not necessary for research.

And ignoring the outcries of ""NEW CASE FOUND IN X CITY"" and obligatory political shoehorning, there is an ongoing thread of actual patient followups establishing the severity of the virus beyond ""oh damn you're infected now!""

Wuhan Coronavirus is worse than the disease from the movie Contagion.

Wuhan Coronavirus has an r naught of around 2.6 by current estimates. Recent reports suggest it could even be as high as 3-5, though I will wait for peer review and stay on the conservative side. Influenza tends to hover around 1.4, and the MEV-1 (based off the very deadly Nipah Virus) from the movie hovered around 2.0. This means that Coronavirus is exceptionally contagious. Later in the movie MEV-1 spikes to 4.0 due to a mutation. Mutations with Wuhan Flu can also be expected as soon as it infects a few million people. The fatality rate of coronavirus is not yet known, as you have to look at people cured vs dead instead of infected vs dead. Currently it is at 3%, although expect this to rise. Early estimate of SARS was 4% and it shot up to 10%. 400,000 people die of influenza each year. 2 per 100,000 people die of Influenza, but 3000 per 100,000 would die of Wuhan Flu at 3% mortality. Mortality isn’t the only thing to look at, severity means people can’t work, food might go scarce, and hospitals will be overrun. The most alarming issue is that Wuhan Flu has an incubation period of up to 14 days (VERY BAD) where it can still infect others. Symptoms from MEV-1 appeared in 36 hours. Another big difference is that a vaccine got pushed out in 4 months in the movie due to narrative reasons, which the director and the CDC said was the most unrealistic aspect as in real life it might take up to a year.

MEV-1 in the movie also came from a Chinese bat. It killed at least 26 million people worldwide and 2.5 million Americans by day 26. Vaccines only arrived by day 133, with no final death count given. Early in the movie it is predicted it will infect 8% of the entire world with a 25% mortality rate. MEV-1 was a fast acting firecracker of a plague, whereas Wuhan Flu seems to be an agonizingly drawn out and insidious killer. If world governments don’t act swiftly final results may be worse than what occurred in the movie. WHO and CDC said that MEV-1 was a very realistic disease in its spread and damage inflicted, as experts were hired to make the movie as realistic as possible, and it remains the most realistic plague movie to this day. Here are two YouTube videos about the movie.

Cytokine Storms were also observed killing those infected with SARS, which this disease is closely related to. Cytokine Storms are part of why the Spanish Flu killed so many young people. While this disease will mainly kill the elderly, very young, and those with preexisiting conditions, young healthy people are vulnerable to death too.

For instance, please see [this article that discusses the subject](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/27/can-i-get-coronavirus-from-a-package-being-delivered-from-china/). 

**The important bits from it:**

>“In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, **there is likely very very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days** or weeks at ambient temperatures,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for Disease Control’s Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Monday morning press briefing.  
>  
>...  
>  
>To be sure, there isn’t research about the specific resiliency of this virus, because it is so new. **But studies show that its cousin viruses, SARS and MERS, only live for few hours on the surface of an object.** They are spread most often by respiratory droplets from one person to another.  
>  
>...  
>  
>“We don’t know if this virus will behave in exactly the same way” as SARS and MERS, said Messonnier. **“But there is no evidence to support transmissibility and there are no cases in the U.S. from imported goods.”**

Basically, the most similar viruses we know to coronavirus can only survive a few hours, at most, on the surface of an object. By the time a headset shipped from China and was delivered to the end user, the virus will be dead. 

I would be far more concerned about coming into contact with someone else who has gotten the virus from someone who has visited China recently than I would be concerned about getting the virus from my Pimax 8KX shipment."

I agree with most of your sentiments, but this statement in particular is dangerously wrong, primarily because Coronavirus (and transmissible diseases in general) are just that - transmissible. Someone getting attacked by a shark is an isolated event. That shark attack doesn't somehow move through the population, attacking more people in a chain reaction. Car accidents are isolated incidents. Spider bites are isolated incidents. Food poisoning is isolated. These isolated incidents cannot be compared to a transmissible disease like Coronavirus, it's simply an apples and oranges thing.

You talk of the general flu, something we *can* compare to. General flu victims are elderly people, people with existing compromised immune systems, or are in some way more susceptible to the flu. Regular ordinary healthy adults do not die from the flu. In other words, the mortality rate is extremely low, around 0.1% (according to the CDC in America). This again is different to Coronavirus whose mortality rate is currently estimated at 3%, a 30x increase. In addition, basic reproduction number for flu is roughly 1.3, whilst it is roughly 3. This number represents the number of people on average to whom an infected person will pass along the disease. So Coronavirus is 30x as deadly and roughly 2.5x as transmissible as the common flu.

You don't fuck around with things like this, you take precautions and inform people of best practices, such as washing your hands/practicing good hygiene, wearing masks if you feel like it helps, immediately going to the doctor if you experience flu-like/coronoavirus-like symptoms, avoiding populated areas if possible, etc.

> Be alert and concerned but don’t let it take over your life and only get your news from reputable sources, not the rumour mill.

This Sub was created because some of us had been there for 3 days  and witnessed some CRAZY shit happen.

r/CoronaVirus was created by some guys in Saudi Arabia many years ago and nobody knows why. They couldn't be contacted so the Chinese authorities took advantage of it.  About 3 days after the outbreak news going main stream the sub became popular and after NUMEROUS contributors told the new mod to go away ( which all of us have no Idea how he was appointed other than he was told by China to assume leadership of that Sub)  The opposite happened and he brought in about 7 people which nobody knew their agenda.

Because it's having influence at the time the sub was getting MASSIVE hits and some PC fools came in and started reporting posts because they didn't have links and ""verified"" facts but instead real encounters of people etc they the new overlords DELETED real Chinese people's vlogs and shit and just anything they wanted to..

(Yesterday) said  appointed moderator from reddit invites ten of his friends in and nobody knows who they are. But we can tell who it is by what's happening in threads as we've been heavily involved in it for the past 3-4 days.

It's Chinese authorities mods 100%

reddit got a 150 Million Dollar investment from Chinese company Tencent and to act like they don't have back channels and influence to the upper echelons of reddit is absurd.

This obviously isn't the coronavirus people are talking about though. The information is too low to really say how deadly it is, but it could be only as bad as the flu, (which kills thousands a year in America):

>Fortunately, the virus seems to cause only minor symptoms — such as fever and difficulty with breathing — in people who are young and healthy. Most of the 41 deaths tied to the coronavirus to date have been in people who were at least 50 years old with underlying medical problems or weakened immune systems, Chinese officials said.

>“We don’t have evidence yet to suggest this is any more virulent than the flu you see in the U.S. each year,” said said [Dr. Michael Mina](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/michael-mina/), an epidemiology researcher at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Most people, with proper medical attention, will do just fine.”  
>  
>In fact, it’s possible that hundreds or even thousands of people in China and elsewhere have been infected but have had such mild reactions that no one even noticed, said [Dr. Tom Inglesby](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-people/inglesby/), director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Some might have fought off the bug without showing any outward symptoms at all.  
>  
>“It’s too soon to know,” Inglesby said. “Often in new outbreaks, the most serious or severe cases are recognized first,” and that may result in a skewed picture of just how dangerous the virus truly is.
