We have been closely watching reports of a new coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.  As of today there have been five confirmed cases in the United States. There have been no identified cases at Georgia Tech or in the state of Georgia.
 
Our health professionals will continue monitoring the situation and are following the direction given by public health experts.  It is important to note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a recommendation to avoid all nonessential travel to Hubei Province, China.
 
Symptoms of coronavirus are similar to the seasonal flu, which remains the higher risk for our population. This is also the time of year when we typically see a rise in cases of seasonal flu.
 
Students who have traveled from central China in the past 14 days and have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should contact Stamps Health Services immediately at 404-894-1420. Options for medical assistance outside of normal business hours are available at health.gatech.edu/after-hours.
 
We encourage all members of the campus community to follow the same preventative strategies used during a normal cold and flu season: getting a flu shot, washing hands regularly, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when experiencing symptoms of illness. Students who have paid their health fee are eligible for a flu shot at no charge.
 
It is recommended that anyone over the age of 6 months get the flu shot, and especially people with chronic medical conditions who are at high-risk for flu-related complications. Information regarding how to get a flu shot at Georgia Tech or what to do if you think you have influenza is available online at the Stamps Health Services website.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Dr. Benjamin Holton
Senior Director, Stamps Health Services"

>Ferguson, whose team have been modelling the disease for the World Health Organization, said they estimated the virus had a reproductive rate of 2.5-3, meaning that each person infected would potentially transmit it to up to three others.

>“My best guess now is perhaps 100,000 cases right now,” he said, although it could be between 30,000 and 200,000. “Almost certainly many tens of thousands of people are infected.”

>Most of the cases that have been exported to other countries from China have been mild, he said. That could mean mild cases of disease spread more easily than severe, life-threatening cases, which sounds like good news. But on the other hand, it means it is possible there will be a reservoir of mild disease in the country that goes unnoticed and can spread until it affects somebody vulnerable because of underlying poor health, who becomes seriously ill.


>Unlike Sars, which made everyone who contracted the virus severely ill, the new virus appears to be able to slip under the radar, he said. Firstly, there are the many mild carriers, who will infect other people without necessarily being recognised. Secondly, there are reports from China of people who have infected others before they have experienced any symptoms."

2020-01-26,BS_Is_Annoying,worldnews,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/eui9ui/live_thread_wuhan_coronavirus/ffpmhh4/,"It looks like it'll be a bad flu with a chance of pneumonia. Most people will survive it. It'll have a low mortality rate (1-5%). and it is fairly transmissible (RO of 2-3  or 2-3 new people infected for each person infected). It also appears to be transmissible from asymptomatic (people without symptoms) people.

The containment efforts appear to be too late and insufficient. We won't know for sure for a few weeks. China's measures seem late and insufficient (it's likely to infect most of China's population). Trump (The executive branch has the most power to react to a disaster like this) doesn't seem to care with an impeachment trial going on and he seems to have surrounded himself with people that have loyalty at the top of their CV (whether you like Trump or not, it's difficult to deny that Trump desires loyalty rather than any other attributes of subordinates).

""Loyal"" people are not likely to share accurate information, so the response to the coronavirus is likely to be slow by the US government. Hours matter in these situations. As far as we know (from public statements), the executive branch has ignored the coronavirus. We don't know if it is too late.

At this point, there are three levels of severity, depending on the virus transmissible number.

1. The best case (R0 2 or less): The containment has mostly succeeded and it'll fizzle out in the next couple of days. Few (10s of thousands) people are infected.
2. The moderate case (RO of 2ish) the disease will spread but once pandemonium takes over, it'll finally stop spreading. Most people are not infected (only a few million) .
3. The bad case (RO of 2.5+) Once local governments start taking it seriously, it's too late. The pandemonium takes over, but it doesn't matter, people need to eat after a week or so they go out and get infected. Everyone (ish) in the world is infected and the mortality rate is applied to the entire world population (Billions) . Even the rural folks.

It's bad, but not earth shattering. About 10X worse than seasonal flu (in terms of mortality) and mostly hurting people who already have compromised immune systems. Compassion goes to people who have compromised immune systems.

With these types of diseases, it's very difficult for most normal humans to avoid. Most people have job duties or want to see family. Even after a few weeks of being locked up, people want to go out. To avoid contamination by self-containment, you'd have to be a hermit for around a month-ish. The timeline is not known and will be different for different places (US vs China).  It's hard to determine if you are someone who is susceptible to this disease. The science just doesn't know yet.

As an individual, your best bet is two strategies. Either get infected early so you get good care (so-so strategy  - a lot is not known) or wait it out to get infected later (better strategy - knowledge is your friend ). You don't want to get infected during the peak season because then you'll be headed to the hospital when it is understaffed and overworked.

Good luck all. ;)"

The symptoms are not that severe (No bleeding out the eyes or other Ebola shit).

Now let's talk about why China's having a meltdown:
1. Their hospitals are woefully unequipped to handle literally thousands of patients who have flooded their ERs. 
2. China recognized that they CANNOT fuck this up again like they did with SARS. So they've overreacted in order to prevent spread.
3. The local government in Wuhan tried to hide the infection in order to protect their jobs resulting in people not getting the care they needed when they needed it.

In any case, if someone is in a place where this isn't a major life disruption (not quitting careers and stuff), it seems reasonably prudent to bug out.  This could be a retiree who is just headed for a summer home a few months early.

If this is a ""pull kids out if schools, end my career, let them forclose on primary residence, and head for the hills"" kind it situation, then Coronavirus is probably a bad reason to press the red button."

Influenza has an incubation period of 3 days- meaning you are unknowingly spreading the virus for around 3 days before showing symptoms of any kind.

Between dorms/proximity issues, near impossibility of disinfection/decontamination of the entire campus, the public transport usage of students (higher than average) and inability to decontaminate/disinfect public transportation,  plus the distribution of students for holidays and to return home, a university is a perfect epicenter for spread and distribution of disease, bioweapons, etc. 

While a coronavirus isn't THAT awful, this is a good way to see what the response is from local, state, and federal government is. It's only a matter of time before some disease evolves, or is evolved, that will travel like this or better, and be more deadly.

People don’t know much about the virus but I can  tell you this much — it’s not the end of the world. Unless you’ve recently been to Wuhan or have interacted with someone who has returned from Wuhan in the past 14 days, you’re very unlikely to contract the coronavirus. However, if you’re worried about it, there are a few ways to prevent the spread: washing hands, avoiding touching your faces with unwashed hands, disinfecting surfaces, etc. 

The reason I can’t say more about how concerned we should be is because people simply don’t know. Symptoms range from mild to severe and experts aren’t perfectly clear on how it spreads. Coronaviruses themselves also range from mild (common cold) to severe (SARS and MERS) so we don’t know yet where on the spectrum it falls. 

Overall, I’d say as of right now, it’s not too serious. It’s being contained and so far the mortality rate isn’t very high. However, information is limited so take my evaluation with a grain of salt."

Yet, here you are, trying to do it anyway- in an oblique sort of way.

Kobe's death is tragic, but is an incident isolated from basically anything else on the planet.

Coronavirus situation is serious, but not yet at the stage of a global pandemic. Definitely worth keeping an eye on though, and there could indeed be more severe consequences if this situation worsens. It is not a scenario without global precedent though.  We are far from the end of days here.

Stock markets will react however they want to, and it will be justified as a reaction to Coronavirus, I suppose. This only becomes logical if Coronavirus becomes a major roadblock to global commerce. But markets aren't always logical. I doubt Coronavirus is going to be the trigger which sends what may perceive as an overdrawn stock market into the gutter. This may or may not happen in the near future.

Be very selective around what news you consume and how you consume it. A lot of news is no longer designed to inform you, but to entertain and enthrall you- it's a dangerous precedent. People are actively trying to hack your mind and emotions for $$$. View / read with a grain of salt, and always put things into a broader context for yourself.

""To the campus community,

We have been closely watching reports of a new coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.  As of today there have been five confirmed cases in the United States. There have been no identified cases at Georgia Tech or in the state of Georgia.

Our health professionals will continue monitoring the situation and are following the direction given by public health experts.  It is important to note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a recommendation to avoid all nonessential travel to Hubei Province, China.

Symptoms of coronavirus are similar to the seasonal flu, which remains the higher risk for our population. This is also the time of year when we typically see a rise in cases of seasonal flu.

Students who have traveled from central China in the past 14 days and have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should contact Stamps Health Services immediately at 404-894-1420. Options for medical assistance outside of normal business hours are available at health.gatech.edu/after-hours.

We encourage all members of the campus community to follow the same preventative strategies used during a normal cold and flu season: getting a flu shot, washing hands regularly, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when experiencing symptoms of illness. Students who have paid their health fee are eligible for a flu shot at no charge.

It is recommended that anyone over the age of 6 months get the flu shot, and especially people with chronic medical conditions who are at high-risk for flu-related complications. Information regarding how to get a flu shot at Georgia Tech or what to do if you think you have influenza is available online at the Stamps Health Services website.

Sincerely,

Dr. Benjamin Holton Senior Director, Stamps Health Services"""

SARS was 2-7 with some up to 10 and rare cases of 14, so I'm guessing a similar pattern here. People on reddit seem to think the average incubation is 14 days which would be absurd.

I also don't believe you are very infectious before symptoms appear. It's in your lungs so if you aren't coughing, sneezing, or kissing someone I really don't see how you could spread this. The viral load would have to be so high to release from just breathing that I can't see any way you'd transmit without symptoms that way."

 News flash - when a virus suddenly emerges and starts causing what may or may not be an increase in fatal pneumonia cases, there is a period where, with the best intentions in the world, nobody knows what the fuck is going on. It starts with “I’ve had double the normal number of pneumonia cases in my unit this week and a few people died, is there something going on or just a statistical blip?” And progresses through stages of confirming that there is something statistically abnormal going on, to in this case isolating a novel strain of coronavirus from the patients’ lungs. Then the question (in this case) is “are we looking at a few unlucky people who caught this virus from animals and all we need to do is shut down that market they’d all been to” and finally “we are now confirming cases that had no likely contact with infected animals, this virus is transmissible between people and we need to take major containment measures”.

I haven’t seen any hard evidence that the Chinese government as a whole has done anything but follow that chi son of reasoning to arrive at the current response. The most plausible claim I’ve seen is that local officials weren’t quick enough to involve the national government in this crisis. But people on reddit are talking as though the streets of Wuhan wee blanketed with corpses and the walls daubed in blood with references to Captain Trips while the government just pretended nothing at all was wrong.,"

In our hospital, each ward has 2 negative pressure rooms - these rooms are used for so many things. If he was to come clean with his story they would either continue along the same path as they have or they'd step him down into isolation but not neg pressure.

If the assembling step is inhibited, then the ability of the virus to copy itself slows.

(Ritonavir is mixed in with lopinavir to slow the breakdown of lopinavir so that it has time to make it to the infected cells and inhibit the virus)

Because this drug was designed particularly for HIV, I imagine it might not work completely effectively for this coronavirus strain, but with further research on the structure of this virus's protease enzyme, modifications to this drug may improve its binding affinity with the enzyme's active site."

**The big question.**

Let’s get the big question out of the way right off:  *Will there be a delay in the BattleTech Campaign’s Wave 1 delivery?*

Yes. Currently the date is looking like critical shipping out of China will commence on or about April 20th, which is 45 days later than we’d planned, with in-zone shipping running 2-4 weeks behind.

We’ll come back to shipping-by-zones and final delivery dates in a moment. In fact, we expect some people have already stopped reading and went right for the kerosene. Which is fair. But for those who want to know the exact state of various Wave 1 items, and what is causing the delays, we will dive right into that here.

**What happened?**

Maybe we were too ambitious. Before the campaign ever kicked off several friends of ours (other game publishers who run large campaigns) told us we were crazy to offer anything less than a twelve month deadline for Wave 1. September 2020? That seemed ridiculous back in June and July when all this was pre-campaign and 12,000 backers seemed like a fantasy.

Still, we spoke to our vendors and added in some extra weeks for safety margins (and, yes, even took Chinese New Year into account). Our primary focus was the Clan Invasion box set and the ForcePack miniatures boxes. Those were (and still are) the core of the campaign. Most anything else could be shoved into Wave 2 as needed (as indeed a few things were). But we figured the CI Box and at least two ForcePacks were mandatory.

*Guaranteed. Shouldn’t be a Problem*, (paraphrasing) our manufacturer.

Of course, there wasn’t an actual “guarantee.” (When we asked for one recently, what we got was effectively: *We don’t do that.)*

In October our calendar looked even *better* than expected. Development of new art was ahead of schedule, 3D models were ahead of schedule. We were able to expand Wave 1 to four ForcePacks, plus the Legendary Set, plus Elementals…and an UrbanMech! All great news. (This also meant Salvage Box randoms would draw from a deeper pool of fifteen Clan ‘Mechs instead of five. Terrific!)

In November, we met again with our reps from manufacturing and checked the calendar. Allotted time for engineering, tooling, samples, and final production. Still, all good. *Might brush up against CNY, but at worst all plastics will be done in January and we will finish the packaging in February. Things can still get rolling by late March.* Okay! Thank God we had built in extra time.

And we felt pretty good about that through the rest of November and all December. Then in early January, we heard the bad news. *The current tooling won’t give you the detail level we promised.  We are going to upgrade your tooling, at our expense, but we won’t finish until after Chinese New Year.* It was another week, around January 15th, when we found out how long after CNY. *Everything will be ready to ship on April 20th!*

This is for the Clan Invasion Box and ForcePacks, without which nothing else in Wave 1 matters!

At this point we had seven hardback rulebook reprints underway for the campaign and looking to ship right after CNY. Plus we had just reprinted the BattleTech Beginner Box (4th Printing) and Game of Armored Combat (3rd Printing), so we were feeling really good there! T-shirts: ready to print and ship before the end of CNY. Coins and Dice were always on a slipping schedule, but because we already knew we would fly them wherever they needed to go, we gave ourselves more time to make them better; but easily done right after CNY to remain on our original mid-March plan. Tukayyid maps… Posters… Patches… Still good! That is where we were. Mid-March *might* become late March only because we got such a late start on the Canon Characters, and we wanted to get one hundred of them into two of the Wave 1 MechWarrior Pilot Decks, but that was it.

All on target. Feeling really good about ourselves and laughing at everyone who said we should plan to ship Wave 1 next September!

But without the plastic miniatures, not going to happen.

We yelled a little. We twisted arms a little. And we know our primary rep at the factory yelled a little and twisted arms a little; trying to move that back up. *This is unacceptable*. That was the message we got in early-January, and why we waited an extra week (and more) to announce the delay, hoping… But then the message came down a week later: *There is no choice*.

April 20th.

F#@&!

**So now what?**

It’s frustrating to know we could have made a late-March date for the beginning of Wave 1 fulfillment, and in the grand scheme of things being about 45 days behind—for the crazy size of this Kickstarter—still feels pretty good. There may be some backers who feel different, but we still remember having to cut off offering new ForcePacks and limiting other physical items during the campaign just because of the insane development and production time it would take. Putting pressure on our 3D modeling team. Trying to budget and schedule a suddenly white-hot BattleTech line.

But just because we have resigned ourselves on plastics not being ready until April 20th doesn’t mean we can breathe easy. We plan to stay on top of each vendor, making sure all other rewards remain on target. We can tweak a few last things into place from a quality standpoint. And we still need to close the pledge manager, get a final count on some of our more mercurial SWAG gear, and work with Quartermaster Logistics to prep one of the most option-heavy shipping plans ever.

Most items are scheduled (now) to ship toward the worldwide Quartermaster hubs between late February and mid-March. Everything will be in place by mid-April, waiting on the miniatures. Maybe we get lucky and the ForcePacks ship ahead of schedule. Maybe. With the coronavirus rampaging through China, we are really just hoping things don’t slip again.

When they do ship, we expect the hubs in Asia and Australia to receive those final pieces within two weeks. The EU will be about one week later. And the US and Canada a week after that. If there are reasonable options to expedite the freight, we will take them. It’s a big campaign with a lot of rewards, but we hope to see the end of all Wave 1 shipping on or about May 31st. That is an estimate, of course, and as we learn more from Quartermaster, we will keep everyone apprised.

**As long as we are on the subject…**

There isn’t much more to say about the campaign schedule, but we can finish with some overall news on the health of BattleTech.

As mentioned above, the fourth printing of the Beginner Box and third printing of the Game of Armored Combat arrived at the warehouse last week. That’s over 40,000 box sets sold through and 15,000 more box sets just now heading out in the market place. All within less than twelve months! That is something we are very proud of, and a strong indicator of the market’s current excitement for BattleTech.

Also, the third printing of TRO: Succession Wars and second printing of TRO: Clan Invasion just hit our warehouse. The second printing of MapPack: Grasslands and a retailer-release of two Alpha Strike Decks (Succession Wars and Clan Invasion) are on a ship. And, finally, as you can see in the photo below, we’ve received proofs for the third printing of the BattleMech Manual, second printing of Alpha Strike: Commander’s Manual, second printing of the vintage cover Total Warfare (sixth printing over-all), second printing of a vintage cover TechManual, and the first printing of the twin, vintage cover Tactical Operation redesigns. These will all be shipping directly after Chinese New Year to be a part of the Clan Invasion Kickstarter.

Without a doubt, it’s the largest set of reprintings for BattleTech in twenty-five years, and might be the largest set of simultaneous reprints in BattleTech’s history."

I am not one to try and hype up disease outbreaks, you can look back in my post history to see I was generally advising that the ebola outbreak in West Africa did not pose too much of a danger to the wider world.

In this case, to say that this is comparable to regular influenza or that things will soon be ""back to normal"" simply does not line up with the situation at hand. To make a comparison the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the United States infected around 60 million people and caused roughly 13,000 deaths according to the CDC. It is estimated to have had an R0 of around 1.5 and it's mortality rate in the US was 0.0022%. As it stands right now the ratio of confirmed cases to deaths  in the current coronavirus outbreak suggests a mortality rate of roughly 3% and preliminary studies have found the novel coronavirus has an R0 of between 2.5-4. Now it is likely that we may still be missing cases in China and the mortality rate is closer to 1-2% but that is still very concerning. If a 100 million people are infected worldwide by this disease over the course of the next year then 1-2 million would die in that eventually. If it is a billion, then 10-20 million people, and this may vary depending on the quality of healthcare and the presence of large populations of immuno-surpressed people (HIV infectees in Africa). 

Suffice to say, if this disease becomes a pandemic it would be the third worst in the modern era with these statistics, with only the Spanish Flu and AIDS surpassing it (and AIDS took decades to kill tens of millions, while this could do it in the matter of months). 

Now we still do not know a lot about the virus, but there is enough to suggest this is definitely more severe than a regular influenza outbreak. Look at the state of the hospital system in Wuhan atm, if this was only as bad as a regular flu outbreak, then the hospital system should be able to manage it. The fact is instead they are currently being overwhelmed, forcing the government to go so far as to build emergency hospitals. I remember the H1N1 pandemic and it too didn't feature any country's hospital system being taxed in the way that Wuhan's is currently. Therefore I think we should assume that this is a serious disease with the potential to cause significant loss of life and economic/social disruption if this were to become a pandemic."

Because the majority of Reddit's userbase is made out of permanently online young people who consume pop-culture media 24/7 as an escapist fantasy for them to get out of their boring and meaningless lives, they want any kind of life-changing incident to happen just like it does all the time in the films/series/comics they live in.

Try to find a single coronavirus post in any subreddit without dumb teens making jokes about Plague Inc, the zombie apocalypse, World War Z, or The Walking Dead, it's fucking annoying, and they're on this very thread right now.

Doesn't matters if it's a virus epidemic, societal collapse, totalitarian dictatorship, or nuclear war that happens as long as they are finally affected by this, so they can finally become superheroes or just simply die altogether, as many of them are also depressed."

The big difference is that we have vaccines for the flu to prevent apocoliptic outbreaks. The flu vaccine slows down the infection rate enough to be manageable for the duration of the cold and flu season. The Novel Coronavirus on the other hand has no vaccine to help slow down infection rates. This could potentially lead to far more sick people than we see during flu season.

Also the suspected ability for the coronavirus to be able to be transmitted before the infected person shows symptoms is scary. At least with the flu we know to avoid obviously sick people. With the coronavirus people could be infecting each other for up to two weeks before the first symptoms begin to show."

With an up to 14-day incubation period and silent contagion, it's going to be incredibly hard to estimate how many people have it; it's almost certainly at least an order of magnitude more than the confirmed cases.

The flu has a mortality rate of 0.1% this is killing 3% on the low estimates. However this is 3x as contagious as the the flu. So take the number of flu deaths and multiply them by three, and then multiply that number by thirty.

Although I am not a doctor, based off my understanding the 2019-nCoV, it is largely an opportunistic virus. I.e. if you are old, very young, already sick, or in some way immunocompromized/weakened it is more dangerous. If you are healthy young adult, (as I imagine an RPI student is), then it is not terribly worrisome. Just maintain good hygenie, don't lick any doorknobs, and stay away from any sick people (or people who did recently visit China) and you should be fine. If you really want to follow the spread Johns Hopkins has a pretty good [site](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).

In my opinion, the probability that it is by design, is much higher than the probability that it's coincidence. This shit was created in a Chinese lab, and either it accidentally got out or it was purposely released. Both options are equally terrifying. On one hand, you may have a semi-controlled experiment to see how an infection propagates through a population. The positive aspect is that it may be able to be controlled. I cannot say to what extent. On the other hand, if it accidentally got out, then that means that there is still innocence on the part of the chinese government and humanity. The scary part is that there are no set controls put in place. So we(humanity) may have to figure it out as we go, and there's a higher chance that we fail to do anything significant in regards to stopping the propagation of the coronavirus.

Inside China there is a growing sense of helplessness, as the government is compelled to take drastic measures to stop the virus, including introducing some travel restrictions in Beijing. I have received panicked queries from journalists and public health workers in China, asking, “How can we protect ourselves and our families?”  
>  
>The epidemic could have been [controlled fairly easily](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/24/opinions/wuhan-coronavirus-china-strategy-garrett/index.html) three weeks ago had there been more openness, swift action, and no attempted cover-up. But now it’s too late, and this virus is [spreading globally](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/24/wuhan-virus-china-belt-and-road-pandemic/). Because there is no vaccine or treatment for nCoV2019—the Wuhan pneumonia—and infection has spread throughout China, the government is forced to turn to its 2003 SARS playbook. And that means entire cities must be cut off, and the population of the nation must be restricted in its movements and potential disease-spreading behavior. It is not surprising then that travel out of Beijing may be forbidden; the entire mainland could go on lockdown soon.  
>  
>I know people are very frightened. And I expect panic will rise in the coming days. But very simple measures can protect you.  
>  
>During the SARS epidemic, I traveled all over China and Hong Kong, interviewed people infected with the virus, doctors and nurses treating the disease, government officials, police—everybody. I was never concerned that I would become infected, despite being in the room with sick individuals. And that’s because I knew what precautions to take. Here are the most important ones to know:  
>  
>1. When you leave your home, wear gloves—winter mittens or outdoor gloves—and keep them on in subways, buses, and public spaces.  
>  
>2. If you are in a social situation where you should remove your gloves, perhaps to shake hands or dine, do not touch your face or eyes, no matter how much something itches. Keep your hands away from contact with your face. And before you put your gloves back on, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water, scrubbing the fingers. Put your gloves on.  
>  
>3. Change gloves daily, washing them thoroughly, and avoid wearing damp gloves.  
>  
>4. Masks are useless when worn outdoors and may not be very helpful even indoors. Most masks deteriorate after one or two wearings. Using the same mask day after day is worse than useless—it’s disgusting, as the contents of your mouth and nose eventually coat the inside of the mask with a smelly veneer that is attractive to bacteria. I rarely wear a face mask in an epidemic, and I have been in more than 30 outbreaks. Instead, I stay away from crowds, and I keep my distance from individual people—a half meter, about 1.5 feet, is a good standard. If someone is coughing or sneezing, I ask them to put on a mask—to protect me from their potentially contaminated fluids. If they decline, I step a meter (about 3 feet) away from them, or I leave. Don’t shake hands or hug people—politely beg off, saying it’s better for both of you not to come in close contact during an epidemic.

>  
>5. Inside your household, remove all of the towels from your bathrooms and kitchen immediately, and replace them with clean towels that have the names of each family member on them. Instruct everybody in your home to only use their own towels and never touch another family member’s. Wash all towels twice a week. Damp towels provide terrific homes for viruses, like common colds, flus, and, yes, coronaviruses.  
>  
>6. Be careful with doorknobs. If it’s possible to open and close doors using your elbows or shoulders, do so. Wear gloves to turn a doorknob—or wash your hands after touching it. If anybody in your home takes sick, wash your doorknobs regularly. Similarly, be cautious with stairway banisters, desktops, cell phones, toys, laptops—any objects that are hand-held. As long as you handle only your own personal objects, you will be ok—but if you need to pick up someone else’s cell phone or cooking tools or use someone else’s computer keyboard, be mindful of not touching your face and wash your hands immediately after touching the object.  
>  
>7. If you share meals, do not use your personal chopsticks and utensils to remove food from a serving bowl or plate and, of course, tell your children to never drink out of anybody else’s cups or from a container of shared fluid. It is customary in China to prepare several dishes for a meal and then allow everybody at the table to use their personal chopsticks to pull food from the common dishes: Don’t do this until the epidemic is over. Place serving spoons in each dish and instruct everybody at the table to scoop what they want from the serving dishes onto their personal plates or bowls, return the serving spoon to the main dish, and then use their personal chopsticks only to pick food from their personal plate or bowl into their mouth. Wash all food and kitchenware thoroughly between meals and avoid restaurants that have poor hygiene practices.  
>  
>8. Absolutely do not buy, slaughter, or consume any live animal or fish until it is known what species was the source of the virus.  
>  
>9. When the weather allows, open your windows at home or work, letting your space air out. The virus cannot linger in a well-ventilated space. But of course, if it is cold or the weather is inclement, keep warm and close those windows.  
>  
>10. Finally, if you are caring for a friend or family member who is running a fever, always wear a tight-fitting mask when you are near them, and place one on the ailing person (unless they are nauseated). When you replace an old, dirty mask from the face of your friend or loved one be very, very careful—assume, for the sake of your protection, that it is covered in viruses, and handle it while wearing latex gloves, place it inside of a disposable container, seal it, and then put it in the trash. While wearing those latex gloves, gently wash the patient’s face with warm soap and water, using a disposable paper towel or cotton swab, and seal it after use in a container or plastic bag before placing it in your household trash. Wear long-sleeved shirts and clothing that covers your body when you are caring for your ailing friend or relative. Clean everything your patient wears or touches very thoroughly in hot soapy water, including sheets, towels, and utensils. If you have space, isolate the sick person in your household in a room, or a corner of a room, where they are comfortable, but separated from the rest of the household. If the weather is tolerable, open a window that is on the opposite side of the room, so that air gently blows past the patient’s face and then outdoors. Of course, don’t do this if it is very cold, as your friend or loved one will be made sicker if uncomfortably cold.  
>  
>The Chinese government will take very drastic actions over the next few weeks, and this will be a time of hardship for the Chinese people. As the virus spreads in other countries, similarly draconian measures may be invoked to slow the epidemic. But with these simple precautions, if taken by everybody in your household, building, office, and school, you will dramatically reduce the spread of the virus and bring the outbreak to its knees.

The patient went in for care when they started feeling ill and is currently at a local hospital, officials said.

The risk of transmission of coronavirus in LA County remains low,"" said Barbara Ferrer, director of the department.

I fully support quarantine efforts, but literally every person outside of Wuhan who is scared about this is a goddamn idiot.

Also, I fundamentally and abhorrently reject your proposal that this is similar to smallpox to the native Americans.

The Chinese government stole the corona virus from a Canadese research facility after which it escaped. 

""A Canadian government scientist at the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg made at least five trips to China in 2017-18, including one to train scientists and technicians at China's newly certified Level 4 lab, which does research with the most deadly pathogens. Xiangguo Qiu — who was escorted out of the Winnipeg lab in July amid an RCMP investigation into what's being described by Public Health Agency of Canada as a possible ""policy breach"" — was invited to go to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences twice a year for two years, for up to two weeks each time. ""This will be third-party funded, and therefore no cost to [the Public Health Agency of Canada],"" say the documents, obtained through access to information requests. The identity of the third-party was redacted. During a Sept. 19-30, 2017, trip, she also met with collaborators in Beijing, the documents say, but their names have also been blacked out. [People working inside the lab] who asked not to be identified for fears of retribution, say there have always been questions about Qiu's trips to China — and what information and technology she was sharing with researchers there. ""It's not right that she's a Canadian government employee providing details of top-secret work and know-how to set up a high-containment lab for a foreign nation,"" one employee said.
[Source] (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/national-microbiology-lab-scientist-investigation-china-1.5307424) 

So she went to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory multiple times, which is a newly certified Level 4 lab that does research with the most deadly pathogens. She may have brought the virus with her. 

The lab is located in Wuhan, close to the Yangtze ([Address](http://english.whiov.cas.cn/About_Us2016/Contact2016)). When the facility was being built there were already worries that a virus could escape. ""In 2017, as the opening of the lab approached, scientists told the publication Nature of their worries that one of those killer viruses could ‘escape’ and go on to infect members of the public. Tim Trevan, a Maryland biosafety consultant, said he had fears China’s culture could make the institute unsafe because ‘structures where everyone feels free to speak up and openness of information are important’.""
[Source](https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/24/us-warned-virus-escape-lab-near-coronavirus-epicentre-12114591) 

In a Nature article it is stated that ""the SARS visus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times"". [Source](https://www.nature.com/news/inside-the-chinese-lab-poised-to-study-world-s-most-dangerous-pathogens-1.21487) 

The point of outbreak of the virus is said to be the Huanan Seafood Market, which is about 20 kilometers or a half hour drive away from the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory if you look it up on Google Maps. I'm not entirely convinced."

Coronavirus has an r naught of around 2.6 by current estimates. Influenza tends to hover around 1.4, and the MEV-1 from the movie hovered around 2.0. This means that Coronavirus is exceptionally contagious. Later in the movie MEV-1 spikes to 4.0 due to a mutation. Mutations with Wuhan Flu can also be expected as soon as it infects a few million people. The fatality rate of coronavirus is not yet known, as you have to look at people cured vs dead instead of infected vs dead. Currently it is at 3%, although expect this to rise. Early estimate of SARS was 4% and it shot up to 10%. 400,000 people die of influenza each year. 2 per 100,000 people die of Influenza, but 3000 per 100,000 would die of Wuhan Flu at 3% mortality. Mortality isn’t the only thing to look at, severity means people can’t work, food might go scarce, and hospitals will be overrun. The most alarming issue is that Wuhan Flu has an incubation period of up to 14 days (VERY BAD) where it can still infect others. Symptoms from MEV-1 appeared in 36 hours. Another big difference is that a vaccine got pushed out in 4 months in the movie due to narrative reasons, which the director and the CDC said was the most unrealistic aspect as in real life it might take up to a year.

MEV-1 in the movie also came from a Chinese bat. It killed at least 26 million people worldwide and 2.5 million Americans by day 26. Vaccines only arrive by day 133, with no final death count given. Early in the movie it is predicted it will infect 8% of the entire world with a 25% mortality rate. MEV-1 was a fast acting firecracker of a plague, whereas Wuhan Flu seems to be an agonizingly drawn out and insidious killer. If world governments don’t act swiftly final results may be worse than what occurred in the movie. WHO and CDC said that MEV-1 was a very realistic disease in its spread and damage inflicted, as experts were hired to make the movie as realistic as possible, and it remains the most realistic plague movie to this day. Here are two YouTube videos about the movie.

With at least 800 cases confirmed worldwide, concerns over the latest coronavirus outbreak continue to escalate. Researchers from China report on the epidemiological and radiological characteristics of the novel virus and clinical outcomes of the first set of infected individuals in two studies that were published January 24 in Lancet.

Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals. Though most coronavirus infections are mild, the new betacoronavirus (2019-nCoV) appears to cause similar symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). Both SARS and MERS are known to trigger respiratory tract diseases and their outbreaks were collectively responsible for over a thousand deaths in the past two decades.

In a new study, researchers from several institutions in China examined the first 41 patients confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV and admitted to Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan between December 16, 2019 and January 2, 2020. They combined patient data from clinical records, laboratory tests, and CT exams in their assessment. The patients had a median age of 49, 66% had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, and more than two-thirds were otherwise healthy individuals.

Upon evaluating the data, the group found that the infected patients presented with a broad range of symptoms, including fever (98%), cough (76%), fatigue (44%), sputum production (28%), and diarrhea (3%). More than half of the patients developed shortness of breath roughly eight days from the onset of illness.

""Despite sharing some similar symptoms to SARS (e.g., fever, dry cough, shortness of breath), there are some important differences, such as the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms (e.g., rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat) and intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea,"" senior author Dr. Bin Cao from Capital Medical University said in a statement.

The imaging findings also revealed that all of the patients had abnormalities evident on their chest CT scans indicative of pneumonia, with 98% of the cases showing bilateral involvement. Typical findings for patients transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation. For non-ICU patients, the scans commonly showed bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation.

Furthermore, nearly 30% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Six patients in the cohort died shortly after hospital admission, five had acute cardiac injury, and four required ventilation.

To prevent the 2019-nCoV outbreak from becoming a pandemic, the situation needs to be carefully monitored and the virus must be deeply studied, the authors noted. Reliable pathogen tests and differential diagnosis based on clinical description and imaging are crucial for clinicians during their first contact with suspected patients.

Person to person

An associated study also published in the Lancet, led by Dr. Kwok-Yung Yuen from the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, investigated the way the coronavirus disseminated among a family that visited Wuhan from December 29, 2019 to January 4, 2020.

Of six family members who traveled to Wuhan, five were confirmed to have 2019-nCoV. None of them had visited the Huanan seafood market, and a separate family member who did not travel to the region was also infected, suggesting that the coronavirus is capable of spreading from person to person.

The most likely explanation for the family's infections is that one individual acquired the coronavirus while visiting a relative at the Wuhan hospital, then later transmitted it to the rest of her family, the authors said. One of the infected individuals had no clinical symptoms of disease, indicating that asymptomatic infected individuals may continue to spread the virus unwittingly.

""Because asymptomatic infection appears possible, controlling the epidemic will also rely on isolating patients, tracing and quarantining contacts as early as possible, educating the public on both food and personal hygiene, and ensuring healthcare workers comply with infection control,"" Yuen said in a statement.

All of the infected family members, except for the asymptomatic individual, presented with a combination of fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, and diarrhea three to six days after exposure. Chest CT scans showed ground-glass opacities in all of the patients, with more extensive radiological changes seen on the scans of the older patients (more than 60 years old).

The researchers have made publicly available the complete 2019-nCoV genome, which they identified from two clinical samples.

Gaps in understanding

2019-nCoV has also proved capable of remaining infectious in individuals through extended travel, with reports of the coronavirus having emerged in at least seven other countries. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed two cases of coronavirus in the country among at least 63 patients currently under investigation.

In a linked commentary, representatives from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Chinese CDC, Oxford University clinical research unit in Vietnam, and University of Virginia School of Medicine underscored the importance of widespread awareness and improving current understanding of the coronavirus.

""To improve detection efficiency, front-line clinics, apart from local centers for disease control and prevention, should be armed with validated point-of-care diagnostic kits. .... Education campaigns should be launched to promote precautions for travelers, including frequent hand-washing, cough etiquette, and use of personal protection equipment (e.g., masks) when visiting public places,"" they wrote.

As there are no existing coronavirus antivirals or vaccines of proven efficacy in humans, a pressing need remains to develop best supportive care and a vaccine, they concluded. ""Every effort should be given to understand and control the disease, and the time to act is now.""

HIV medication are called anti retrovirals (ARV). They prevent HIV from spreading inside a host by preventing the virus’s means of replication. There’s a lot of medication in the market and they accomplish this same task through different ways.

There’s speculation that there a cocktail of ARVs that can also stop coronavirus from replicating.

ARV is toxic. People living with HIV and who are taking ARV to suppress the virus for decades often die from complications of the medication (liver, heart or kidney disease)"

I would guess that the lower mortality with novel coronavirus  compared to SARS is due to 1) ongoing underreporting of mortality and 2) advances in epidemiology and case surveillance since 2003. 

As an aside, the way Americans handle these scenarios drive me insane. They certainly can be concerning and need to be taken seriously by governments and groups like WHO and the CDC but influenza has a way larger disease burden with ~50000 deaths annually in the US yet 1 in 2 American adults remain unvaccinated (and rates among children aren’t much better)."

China shut down the lunar new year holiday and barred people from travelling in the worst affected areas. that's when you know shits fucked up. [More than 60 million people are under partial lockdown in the provinces of Hubei and Guangdong.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/25/china/wuhan-coronavirus-update-intl-hnk/index.html) This is not Ebola in remote African villages. Ground zero is a city of **14 million**. THink **NYC and Jersey combined.**

Add to that it's [coming out now that the shit can spread before any signs of infection](https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-hnk-intl-01-26-20/index.html) \- which means you can **scan & screen everyone at the airports to your heart's content** \- the carriers sail right by - they think it may take up to 2 weeks to become symptomatic - in the meantime, every hand they shake, ***every car they get into and sneeze in ....***

But I didn't want to panic for no reason - how many people from CHina come to the US every year anyway? I was curious so I googled it and it's around [2.8 -3.0 million or approx 7600 to 7800 a day.](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/31/728590535/chinese-tourism-to-u-s-is-down-after-years-of-booming-growth)

If you count just from when they shuttered the **Huanan Seafood Market** on Jan 1st, thats over 200k Chinese that have entered our country since then.

If even a couple of dozen or so are infected and walking around cities like NY, LA, Miami, etc - that's a problem.

Add to that folks going to different countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc and now those populations are travelling. It gets scary fast. If you have seen those youtube videos coming out of (allegedly, of course) the hot zones in CHina - they say 100k infected or more and the news is being suppressed by the .gov folks over there.

If it's true this stuff spreads from human to human before they even cough or sneeze or spike a fever - this is going to be a very very bad year or two or three and the world's population is going to go in reverse for a bit.

By the time the media announces a full travel ban from CHina and the far east, you've already shook hands or had someone in your car that was infected and didn't know it.

Most of what you are reading from people who say it's nothing to worry about and not to worry because they are healthy have it dead wrong. This shit can kill you even if you are not elderly and immuno compromised.

THEY CANCELLED THE EQUIVALENT OF CHRISTMAS for millions of Chinese citizens and barred them from travelling and spending money.

For them to do that signals this is not the fucking common cold or 'just another flu' and the western media is 2 months behind and trying to play catch up and then you remember - China is not the US **and yes they can suppress stuff.**

There are youtube videos out there right now (allegedly) from the hotzone saying 100k infected and thousands dead and dying.

I'm just saying: observe some common sense precautions. If you are a driver coming in contact with the public, especially the airport and especially folks on international flights I would glove and mask up starting now. carry antibac lotion and soaps in your car and start washing hands multiple times a day . start practicing [some basic  Hand  Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette.](http://professionals.site.apic.org/protect-your-patients/follow-the-rules-for-isolation-precautions/)

If someone coughs or sneezes, crack a window or two for a few seconds and get the air out of the car - don't just re-circulate it. lysol the car every day including doors and touch surfaces."

The only way to keep up is pretty much browse this sub by new and have some critical thinking skills to filter out all the crap. Chinese media or chinese sources have usually been pretty good at getting new info, local news for new infections.

One of those emails was about MERS, which is also caused by a coronavirus. “Coronavirus” is a very broad descriptor that includes several families of viruses. 

I’m not saying there’s a conspiracy here. But if you want to look for one, maybe look into where the 2nd largest biotechnology research center in China is. Then look into a little bit of why coronaviruses make excellent vectors for gene therapy. 

It’s very plausible this just happened naturally. RNA viruses are error-prone, so it’s not at all unlikely for a type of virus that is used a lot in biotech, particularly because of how amenable its tropism is to new hosts, to spontaneously mutate to be able to infect humans. 

Usually researchers that make ‘designer coronaviruses’ implement biosafety measures into the genome to prevent something like this from happening if one escapes. They aren’t foolproof, but they can be pretty effective. So while there’s certainly a chance that maybe the Wuhan virus is the result of something accidentally escaping from a lab, I wouldn’t bet on it. 

Now, knowing a little bit about coronaviruses, I will admit that this has all the makings for some nefarious act of bioterrorism. If someone wanted to do something of that nature, this would certainly be a logical way to do it. 

However, the first question you should always ask yourself when considering  a conspiracy theory is “why? What purpose does this serve?” and if you can’t think of any sensible reasons beyond ‘pOpUlatiOn cOnTrol’ or ‘big pharma’, your conspiracy is probably not one to worry about much. A person with the expertise it would take to design a virus like this *on purpose* would also understand that releasing it could potentially kill them and everyone they care about. *...unless they knew of a way to cure or prevent it.*"

I do understand that people may be concerned about the outbreak starting in China and the fact that it's spreading, but yeah that's not necessarily the faults of those who were exposed to it especially the international Chinese students.

There has been concern in Australia over schools returning this week after the summer break.

This means we have a higher chance of getting it, and despite the lower mortality rate, is it not a similar result?

If in a population of 100,000 people, let's say the coronavirus is capable of infecting 10,000 of them, whereas SARS has a chance of infecting 80 of them (I don't have the SARS numbers on me, sorry).  SARS had a 15% mortality rate, this has a 2-3% mortality rate.  That means about 10-12 people will die from SARS, but 2019 n-CoV may kill 200-300 of them.  Is this still not a cause for concern?

I mean, it's still kinda scary - this sounds like it can still be a bit of an issue if it's more than likely we can get it like influenza.  I can't imagine in the future there being a ""2019-nCoV season"" because of how contagious it is.

In Wuhan not only did they arrest the first to report of a SARS like illness they then— decided to try to break a world record by having a banquet some 15 days after some of their smartest and bravest tried to tell others of the severity of this illness.

Plus I’m going  to add this. Guess what they do not have SOAP at their maternity wards or immunization centers.  Women and families have to bring their own soap.  No damn lie. I wish people would talk more about that simple hygiene problem at their hospitals but they don’t.

Shopping malls and hotels have BETTER bathrooms.  I was in one of their MAJOR cities and we had to go to a maternity hospital and immunization center and I said— “ at least the bathrooms will be good!”  And was told— “guess again.”  That person was right.

China stop being so damn cheap and provide soap for patients in your maternity wards, and at the immunization clinics.  The only good thing to say is that in other countries it won’t spread as bad because hospitals provide soap in their bathrooms for free in most other countries.

The Toronto man infected with the country’s first case of the novel coronavirus was symptomatic on an airplane returning to Canada from China last week, meaning other passengers could have potentially been exposed to the illness.

However, Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said the risks to most people who may have passed by the man in the airport or on the airplane is low. According to scientific evidence, the coronavirus is spread by droplets, so the people who face the highest risk of infection would be those in close contact with the infected individual for prolonged periods of time, she said.

“People transmit when they’re in close contact,” Dr. Tam said.


Federal, provincial and local health officials are now racing to identify and contact individual passengers to speak to them about the risks and to take precautions. Passengers who were seated within a two-metre radius of the patient will be contacted, Dr. Tam said.

Isaac Bogoch, an infectious-diseases specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said that most respiratory infections are passed between people in close proximity. On an airplane, for instance, that could mean people who are seated next to the infected individual.

The patient, a man in his 50s who had recently travelled to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, landed at Toronto’s Pearson Airport on Wednesday. He flew to Toronto from Guangzhou on China Southern Airlines flight CZ311 on Tuesday, Jan. 21.

The next day, he called 911 after he began to feel ill. He informed the dispatcher of his symptoms and his travel history, which allowed paramedics and hospital officials to take the proper precautions, such as wearing masks, eyeglasses and gowns.

Since then, the man has been in isolation at Toronto’s Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.

Dr. Tam said that passengers who do not receive a phone call from public health authorities do not need to take precautions.

Public Health Ontario tested samples from the man and on Saturday, confirmed he has the coronavirus. Now, Canada’s National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg is also testing the samples to confirm the results. The findings are expected within the next 24 hours.


China first alerted the World Health Organization of the virus, known as 2019-nCoV, on Dec. 31. The situation has evolved rapidly since then. Chinese authorities released a genotype of the virus, which has allowed public health officials around the world to develop diagnostic tests to identify potential cases of 2019-nCoV. The number of cases has also risen quickly, with nearly 2,000 cases and 56 deaths. The vast majority of illnesses and deaths are in China, but the virus has also spread around the world, with eight cases in Thailand, three cases in the U.S. and three in France."

Reports are fatalities and infection rate may be higher with those dying at home not being reported.

Hospitalization rate is 25%. Spread rate is slightly higher than flu.

This year 40 million got the flu in the us. 1 million had to be hospitalized.

If coronavirus spreads and infects 40 million then ten million will require hospitalization, with those who don't receive such care suffering a higher mortality rate.

So worst case it's probably Spanish flu 2.0.



I wouldn't trust the numbers out of China. If it wasn't that bad they wouldn't be locking down cities left and right and speed building military hospitals.

I suspect the official numbers are at least an order of magnitude too low.

The virus hijacks the host cell's machinery to make its proteins that will be packaged together to make more virus copies. When the host cell makes the virus's protein, it comes out as a single, long protein strand. This particular protein, that just had its structure determined, is an enzyme that works by chopping up the long protein strand at specific points in order to produce more proteins that have differing functions. This enzyme can either be injected by the original invading virus alongside its genetic material, or it can be part of the newly translated polypeptide sequence and cleave itself off from the strand before performing its main cleavage function (I don't know which it is for this particular coronavirus).

The practical use for this discovery is in designing drugs that can permanently bind with the active site of this enzyme to inactivate it, which would prevent the virus from processing more copies of itself. This means that such a drug would be used on people who are already infected, but not as a preventative measure, like vaccines.

I went a bit more into the specifics on how this enzyme functions in another comment in this thread if you are interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/euflx1/chinese_scientists_established_crystal_structure/ffp1qyo/"

> Some media reports have referred to coronavirus as the “China virus”, or ""Chinese virus"" in shorthand. Reporting like this racialises the disease and allows the risk of a disease to be conflated with the risk to minority groups, allowing them to be singled out as second-class citizens.

They're my classmates, fellow club officers, and TAs. Some do have family or friends in Wuhan. We have a higher % of Chinese international students than RPI did.

I'm trusting the CDC to figure out if any pose a threat to me. And I'm viewing the coronavirus as the latest disease scare. Every couple years, there's a new disease. It starts out with a scary-sounding death toll, and fears that it will spread like wildfire. Obviously, if you're unlucky and get very sick, it affects you, but compare your chances of getting the coronavirus and dying with getting into a car accident or even something rarer like a piece of parking garage falling on you and crushing you. Don't be racist. China is a big country.

“Depends on the virus. HIV can only survive on surfaces for minutes to hours but some flus can live up to a week. Ebola up to a few weeks.

I wouldn't worry about the coronavirus. You're more likely to get the common seasonal flu, and that flu currently has a higher rate of death than the coronavirus. And as a bonus, the above steps will vastly reduce your chances of getting the flu, too."

But also disease was less easily wide spread due to lack of transportation. Now diseases can cross the globe in hours because of planes, thousands of people commute in packed trains across cities, all sharing and breathing in each other’s germs. We come into contact with so many people every day, who in turn come into contact with so many people etc. 

Previously a person may have gotten sick, and it may have spread around the village or even town, but it would remain fairly isolated, meaning it would eventually die out in that area. Now we look at Coronavirus and it’s spread quickly around China, and the world, which was far less likely in less densely populated areas and when transport options were far more limited and slow moving. 

So basically if a baby got the disease they would be more likely to die from it, but ultimately disease was far harder to spread so they came into less contact overall with diseases."

I did a quick google search, and according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 14.3 people in the US die for every 100,000 people infected with influenza or pneumonia. That would mean your chances of dying if you have the flu is about 0.0143 percent. Meanwhile, the current estimates of your chance of dying if you have the coronavirus is around 6%, and could be higher due to hidden cases or improper accounting. That means you’re more than 400 times more likely to die from the coronavirus than the flu, while the coronavirus is also very infectious and difficult to catch in the infectious period before symptoms show.

In science terms, a ‘control’ means something which you do no experiments on so you can see how your work affects whatever you’re studying. It’s not a master or programmable copy of the virus. Anyway, why would a virus locked up in a UK-based lab (but more than likely destroyed once it wasn’t needed anymore) show up in a fish market in China? Pretty unlikely, wouldn’t you say?

As you say, the patent mentions SARS, which is another kind of coronavirus. But the patented vaccine has nothing to do with SARS, the reference is just there for context. There’s no reason to believe this vaccine and the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan are in any way connected.

Let me try an analogy: Do you have siblings? Trying to connect one kind of coronavirus to another is like your sibling robbing a casino and the police arresting YOU for it because you have the same last name and you watched Ocean’s 11 once.

The version of the patent I linked to is the European version of the patent, while yours is the US version. It’s the same thing under discussion but there may be differences to account for different patent law in the two regions.

Like u/ConfuzzledDork said, spreading the ‘coronavirus was created in a lab’ scare story doesn’t help anyone. The fact that some scientists were studying a related (but not the same) virus years ago proves nothing and spreading misinformation is only going to make it harder for the people fighting the outbreak to do their job."

> I asked my friend who studied contagions at Harvard/Cambridge and she said a coronavirus would be a strange choice for bioweapon

1) Not everything at research labs are bio-weapons. Most of it probably isn't, in fact. There is a lot of interest in just understanding viruses and organisms just because things like SARS and this outbreak happen occasionally, and just in the general interest of community health.

2) Your friend is assuming the objective of using a bio-weapon is to kill. That's not necessarily the case, and a fast killing bio-weapon might actually be less favored in various circumstances than a bio-weapon which can stealthily spread and then cause major disruptions throughout society/supply chains/command structures/troops/etc. If you were wanting to deploy a bio-weapon, would you rather take out one and kill battalion quickly, or reduce the effectiveness of an entire war campaign, providing an opportunity to out-maneuver their entire effort, providing great strategic benefit?"

CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 15 million flu illnesses, 140,000 hospitalizations and 8,200 deaths from flu.

Over 50% of influenza positive test results from public health laboratories this season are in children and young adults (<25 years), while only 12% are in adults aged 65 and older. This has resulted in high levels of outpatient illness, but lower levels of hospitalization and death due to influenza. However, influenza can still cause severe disease in children.

15 additional pediatric deaths were reported this week, bringing the total for the season to 54. Influenza B viruses account for 37 of the 54 reported flu-related pediatric deaths this season.

Influenza has likely been around for millennia, though its cause was only identified relatively recently.

Influenza has plagued humankind for centuries and, given its highly variable nature, may continue to do so for centuries to come.

Too early to tell what this Coronavirus will do.  The difference is, there is a Flu Shot which is only about 40% to 60% effective. There is no vaccine currently for Coronavirus."

They're so named because of the protein spikes that stick out from their viral bodies - it looks kind of like a crown (corona in Spanish) around the virus in scans and such. The Wuhan strain hasn't been given a sexy media name yet, so it's simply referred to as ""Novel Coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV"" for the time being.

The Wuhan virus is closely related to SARS/MERS and certain forms of the common cold virus. There are many naturally occurring varieties of coronavirus around the world that are hosted by animal carriers (the Wuhan strain appears to have come from bats, but it's not 100% certain yet). These viruses are carried by their host animals, but do not make them sick; however, when the carrier animals come in close contact with human populations there's always a risk of the virus ""crossing over"" - adapting its structure to infect humans.

And that's exactly what happened with the Wuhan strain - a coronavirus in bats made the leap to humans, and has since become highly infectious. We do not yet know the full severity of the illness - early case reports always skew towards critical-care patients who were ill enough to seek out immediate medical intervention, and we have no way of knowing how many others caught the virus & shrugged it off at home as a bad cold. It's most likely not as bad as initial reports (and internet fear mongering) indicate, and we will have better information over the next few weeks as more cases unfold.

I'm not trying to downplay the severity of the situation - any novel, highly-infectious disease is a cause for concern - but we can't afford to let ourselves get caught up in a blind panic response."

If you’re feeling sick, try and care for yourself. There is no cure for the flu or the coronavirus. If you’re unable to care for yourself or someone else that is sick, then yes, go to the hospital.

But, talk to your health care provider before going in. Ask them the best steps to take before going out and risk getting others sick.

Follow your local and state health departments as well as the CDC.

Media outlets will over exaggerate rumors and claim they’re true, and rarely will they admit and or tell you when information is false or a post is taken down.

While diseases can spread quickly, and this is absolutely something that heath organizations are following very closely, unless you're visiting China (especially around Wuhan) on your cruise, then this should be pretty far down on your list of concerns.

For influenza, coronavirus, norovirus, the common cold, etc - practice frequent and thorough hand-washing.  Also, if you've not done so yet, get a flue shot.  The flu shot has nothing to do with corona, but it's a FAR more important action if you're worried about getting sick this time of year.

It is wrong to compare the Hugos and Nebulas now and the Hugos and Nebulas then. Those are different awards. Their name is purely coincidental.

Since the 2010s the Hugos, Nebulas and most other awards have become a promotional tool funded or backed by traditional publishers with the intention to push sales of shitty books of authors who work from within the system. This is why almost all the awards go to women.  85% of publishing is middle-class women, overwhelmingly white, often narcissistic.  The awards are like the Oscars. Make them feel important and give them a sense of accomplishment that they can't find in their lives. So because they can't write a good novel to save their life they need their daddy/husband/publisher to give them an award.

The female writers are the definition of undeserved privilege which probably is why they complain so loudly about everyone else.  (1) Misdirection. (2) Narcissistic projection.

In the past, and definitely in the 70s and 80s Hugos and Nebulas were much more like an insider pat on the back in a small world of SFF where people would have a gentleman's agreement to let the best win. That doesn't mean that it was free of ego or rivalries but the genres were small and it was more of a gentleman's club competition than a market with marketing issues like today.  And so indeed with astounding regularity the best did win.

With one exception -  Ursula LeGuin went against Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five and that's a toss up depending on your preferences.  Vonnegut's is clearly the better known and more influential novel and IMO a better book.  But some people for some reason really like LeGuin's. I can see why they like the book itself. But I also know a few things about the science that she ignores in the book so it becomes too jarring as a SF work and that spoils it for me. This is why I like LeGuin as a fantasy writer but don't like her as a SF writer. She's a good fiction writer. She's not a good *science* writer. 

But in every other instance the win was 100% deserved as those are genre-defining classics and they also smashed the competition in a way that is just not fair and there were no real competitors. (Don't ask me how Zelazny got to share it with Herbert... I don't want to know)

Now fast forward to modern time and you have a string of double Hugo/Nebula winners which are dumpster fires getting awards for books that are at best mediocre. The last four are great example - two of which were paid by Orbit and two by Tor. All written by women because no man alive can write an award-winning book. Hugo and Nebula are essentially the *Tor And Orbit Award For Women In SFF Who Write Under-performing Books*.  Why? Because women work in publishing and men don't.

-----

Anyway here's my list since you asked. 

* Dune - the only SF book to come close to Tolkien's achievement and the least broken by Herbert's idiosyncracies that plague later novels.
* Forever War - my personal favourite story in SF but the book is more clumsy than the graphic novel which is much better as a story. If it was the Marvano+Handleman in color it would be no.1. As such it has to yield to Dune.
* Neuromancer - not a great book but a revolutionary vision that created (or helped to create) an entire sub-genre.Very dated today. Stunning at its time.
* Speaker for the Dead - the one true flash of brilliance that Card had, that also caused Ender's Game to be written. Smarter than you think.  I often wonder how Card wrote it, probably by accident because the books feels a bit more mature than anything else he did.
* Rendezvous with Rama -  All around top-form Clarke in the most textbook old-school sf imaginable.
* Ender's Game - It's a mix of good and bad ideas and a bit too shallow and unbelievable.It's not as good as people think it is, not as smart as the author thought it but the things that people dismiss about it are paradoxically brilliant. 
* Left Hand of Darkness - it's a metaphor of gender and society based in gender ideology that contradicts science. The metaphor is good and LeGuin can write it well but it's just *wrong*. It's not that there's anything inherently wrong with the book itself. It's just like a sf book that writes how vaccines are a conspiracy to keep people obedient. It is a possible scenario that might be important to consider for some dystopian future or as a thought experiment but it is not what vaccines are, how they work, and how they were invented.  
* Ancillary Justice - because it's not as bad as Jemisin, just bland, lazy, derivative and unintelligent and annoying because Leckie knows only English so what she thinks is smart (her take on gender in language) is really really fucking dumb. This will sit well only with the ""latinx"" club of linguistic geniuses. As a speaker of a couple of gendered languages I fart in the general direction of this book.
* NK Jemisin - because everything she writes is an annoying self-indulgent pretentious bore that always manages to turn out worse than you feared. It is an achievement to write books that bad that look so good. It's like every movie of the Wachowski Brother's other than the Matrix."

This novel virus may be related to SARS, but doesn’t seem to be as virulent nor with a higher mortality rate. 

Anybody who has a compromised immune system, the elderly, the young, or have chronic health conditions, is at a higher risk of severe complications and potentially death. For the majority of people they just become unwell and get better with supportive care. I think the estimated mortality rate is about 4% right now."
