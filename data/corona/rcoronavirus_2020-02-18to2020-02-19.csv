So, if they announce it tomorrow the whole world swirls into panic, work stops, shipping stops- China‚Äôs halted economy becomes the world halting it‚Äôs economy. Whatever chance we have to minimize the damage of this virus lays in gearing up for impact. The longer all is worker drones are doing our jobs and not blocking up the roads, the better our chances of survival in the long run.

Yes, some will die and some will get very ill, but more will be able to be treated if these agencies have more time to prepare. Isolation pods popping up at hospitals, military bases converting to isolation centers and those are just the things we are seeing, likely much more going on outside the public view... the media minimization is to keep the stampede of panic from impeding preparations. 

At a very personal level, I resent not being told the truth but then I look around me and consider how many people in the grocery line beside me have a room temperature IQ and a firearm... okay, maybe media suppression isn‚Äôt so bad. 

If you are smart enough to read between the lines right now, then you are smart enough to step back from the micro & recognize the macro situation. These agencies are doing what needs to be done in the time available.

You have summed up perfectly what I have been trying to tell the people around me. This thing is coming and the reason the government's/media aren't telling us the truth is because the world is just not ready to deal with the chaos and destruction it will cause. 

You simply have to look at China and how they have responded to this to know this is bad. And China's valiant but far too late in the game attempt at containment has clearly failed. It has already spread to what almost 30 countries in a matter of weeks? 

Believe me I am not a doom porner of any kind and I sincerely hope you and I are wrong on this but the bigger picture tells the story right now. My girlfriend thinks I'm mad that I have bought her P3 masks (I think that's the N100 equivalent in the UK) and the people I work think I'm fucking nuts cause I have bought a month's worth of food and water.

They should have denied the entry. BTW, this is a British ship operated by Carnival (British-US corporation).  Some people seem to think it's a Japanese ship.

Initially, the US offered to let them dock in Yokosuka Navy Base, then later retracted. The Japanese government should have thought WHAT IS THE TRUE REASON for the retraction. Maybe the US did not want to jeopardize the mobility of the US military, which is actually protecting Japan in many ways. Or is it too big for the US to handle?

The Japanese government must have thought they can handle. Then it turned into a huge problem.

There is no facility to accommodate 3,700 people in isolation in Japan.
The government struggled to find a place for the first Japanese evacuees from Wuhan on the chartered flight. Ended up some being assigned to the same room. People got so upset, yelled at the government official. He was so stressed. He committed suicide. It was such a big news in Japan. No one seems to care outside the country though. 

More stress. More criticism from overseas. No place to for passengers and crews to go off the ship. They kept them onboard. They are also threat to the Japanese public health on the ground. What could they have done after agreeing to let Diamond Princess dock.

I honestly don't know."

That is an odd OR above. So basically those Americans on board now likely are showing no symptoms.  Probably they got tested (negative) in order to leave (Japan testing everyone and letting folk go who test negative). So I guess then Americans who leave ship tomorrow or Thursday/Friday are clear on current test and have to wait around Japan 14 days and then sign a statement saying ‚ÄúI have had no symptoms for past 14 days while on Japan mainland‚Äù, then they can board. 

But no retest.  And it does not appear that they will be quarantined after getting back to United States. So policy is kinda good but also kinda interesting."

Each day I am plotting a new 2-factor polynomial best fit (blue line) from the actual data (blue dots).

Indeed, one may have said virus for weeks and be astmptomatic due to many different reasons. One might be quorum sensing, where a certain density of viruses need to be present for them to ""activate"" so they will only replicate at first. Furthermore, they may not affect your immune systek in any way. Others may lay dormant in cells until they ""feel"" it is the right time to start. Breathing can spread the virus, most viruses in fact. So can touching a contanimated area. To answer your question on asymptomatic spread of viruses, these asymptomatic people spread the virus just like an infected person but just dont show symptoms as they themselves have the virus. Closeness to said the infected person, level of contact, how infected said person is, how susceptible you are, how strong your immune system is, and what precautions you have took to prevent the virus from making contact with your skin or cells, are all factors that can affect if you actually contract the virus or not. Unfortunately, I am not qualified to answer your last question.

Edit: As mentioned in another comment someone may be asymptomatic if they have a strong immune system."

The [latest thing](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/COVID-19/200123-CCDCdoc1.pdf) I could find from China's CDC via Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security seems to suggest that they'd only be counting cases who had all three symptoms (fever, pneumonia and a decreased white blood cell count) and at least some kind of epidemiological history:

> (1) A history of travel or residence in Wuhan within 14 days of onset of the disease;   
>  
>(2) patients who had been exposed to fever with respiratory symptoms from Wuhan within 14 days of the onset of the disease;   
>  
>(3) There is a clustered incidence or is epidemiologically associated with the confirmed case.  

To me, that means that the cases in the rest of China will drop to zero pretty quickly as we get further past 14 days from the beginning of travel restrictions to/from Wuhan. Basically if you haven't been to Wuhan (you haven't) in the last 14 days and you aren't directly connected to a confirmed patient who was confirmed using the above criteria, you aren't going to be considered.

Does anyone have anything more recent than this?"

I will also make sure I to never go on a cruise until they have a vaccine for this thing (or this coffin-ship rests at the bottom of the Marina Trench, where it belongs now).


Now, I don't say this often and I'm not very happy about this myself, but I do hope that each and every passenger on that ship sues the cruise-line and Japan and everybody else who has a part in mishandling this and wins *big*."

Building quarantine centers like China is a ridiculous idea. That's just putting all sick people in one box, not giving adequate care. Besides the passengers are from 56 or so countries. Majority are foreign nationals. Why the Japanese government has to spend so much money when there is a perfect containment facility with a room for everyone, kitchen, PR system, and on and on---that is the cruise ship ITSELF.

Did they handle the containment well? NO. Did things go well NO. Is there any other way to handle 3,711 people onboard? Yea maybe if we all know what to do from the beginning. So the perfect scenario for Japan would have been to deny their entry.

Your logic is sound, it is a question of probability. Which should be assessed using such a model.

We also have many unknowns, for instance a long incubation asymptomatic superspreader that is never identified but spreads the virus to many people. This would be very difficult to identify as there would only be tacit indications of this and convolved with other possibilities.

If you don't think this had anything to do with Russia closing itself hardcore today then you're not paying attention. 

This is HUGE news, and it represents that a single screw up in containment management can have catastrophic cascading consequences.  That will result in SOME fatalities and at minimum put thousands of people at risk just to properly  manage the next attempt at quarantine.   Let alone the financial and legal implications that will be passed on to citizens and budgets not prepared.

Every failed containment vector (person) creates a MASSIVE risk on healthcare and logistics chains that we are seeing are ill prepared to absorb this.   The Diamond Princess should have been an example of how western medicine and first world countries had their act together and were going to quell this.  Instead, we have the slow trickle of guilt admission that they were caught off guard and don't know what they were doing.

The world needs bold leadership right now.   Not passivity and playing to special interests.  This is not the 2003 SARS outbreak, and this is not the flu. 

The WHO needs to be on a near war footing and stop being so passive and worrying about offending corporations and making sure it plays up to everyone.  Their job is public health.   It should be getting pissed with countries that are being lazy, especially ones that are capable, funded and prepared.   It should start by showing up to its own press briefings on time and actually LEAD how health care responds and not just read politically correct talking points.  

It should also call out the US for failing to contain passengers coming from Cambodia as well and actually follow up on the comedian who is now booking his shows without having been tested yet.   

It should call out Japan, the Diamond Princess handling and talk openly about how to avoid this with all remaining risk involving cruise ships and large citizens closed quarter scenarios. 

The WHO and CDC's should actually clarify what's going on with the PCR test efficacy and squash the disinformation that's out there.  If we don't have the kits, if they don't work, say so.   The fog of what test, how long they take, who gets to use them, who doesn't, how many can we actually test should not be a mystery. 

If we can't test, then we best quarantine.   Let's figure out how to scale that and get it done. 

Just look at reddit and the amount of energy around this outbreak, its more about click baiting, jokes and trying to prove conspiracy theories than actually attempting to stop the virus whether through science or old world tactics.  

The public can participate and help, leveraging subs like this.   Best practices from the CDC and WHO need to be repeated daily, the sources need to be unified and they can't vary, they need to be updated rapidly when mistakes are made. 

Singapore is representing the gold standard in broadcasting the 19th century trace methodology that should be globally adopted.   It worked in 2003.

Japan and China both should NOT be shunned and bashed into the corner, they need to be empowered so that they QUICKLY get their mistakes known and unknown topside so the rest of the world can rapidly correct their preparations. 

This really is nearing the final moments where we can ask ourselves ""How might we ourselves do something to help the cause, as a people.""  Not as any one nation, creed, company or whatever. 

The Diamond Princess will go down as a major turning point in this saga, where the excuse of just saying ""its behind the Chinese Firewall"" was why we failed as a people won't fly."

Well, for LED parts including companies like Cree, this was the case in China.  
About 10(?) years ago there was an outbreak of these mites in basically the few factories that produced a vast majority of the parts for lighting LEDs.  They were pretty much unknown about for a long time - certainly during the manufacturing process.  What would happen is that these mites would lay their eggs all over the place... and that was it.  Until the devices were turned on, which produced heat.  Which enabled the eggs to hatch.  And destroyed the LED parts.  

Whole factories were affected.  They tried to get rid of them, and failed, thee things were in everything.  Pretty much the end result was they literally burned the factories to the ground in order to kill the mites, and re-built the factories.

I don't remember precisely when it was, but by estimate of my memory I'm gonna say somewhere around 2008, maybe as late as 2011-ish?

It set production of all LED lighting components back for a long time, BUT fortunately this was around the time LED products were still pretty new, so they weren't everywhere quite yet in terms of replacing halogen and other products."

So either that policy works, the virus goes away by summer, a few thousand dead buried under flu or pneumonia death, just like H1N1, or this becomes something you'll tell your grandkids about, if you live through it."

In a way, the CFR doesn't matter if the disease spreads widely and rapidly, certainly not with regard to ""deadliness."" A disease that covers X number of people with a CFR of 25% can be quite a bit less deadly than a disease that covers twenty times that number with a CFR of 2.5%

Your calculation doesn't make sense to anybody else. But most importantly, you are not taking into account the backlog (the time it takes for an infected to die is different than the time it takes for an infected to recover). So you are looking at the persons that died today from being infected perhaps two weeks ago vs the persons infected (who knows?) 4 weeks ago, that just know reported recovered. 
But 4 weeks ago we had a very different number of total infected than 2 weeks ago. 

It seems you are really thinking with very simple (and incorrect) math for something that requires more complex reasoning to take into account all aspects of it.

Just read the estimates from the experts, you'll have a more accurate idea rather then making random calculations. 

What you are trying to calculate is your chance of dying, I think. 

Mortality is a different concept in epidemiology:

It is considered shameful to say, do, think, etc. anything which doesn't conform to the tribal beliefs - AT THE CURRENT MOMENT (<-- this is key). 

Not too long ago it was embarrassing/shameful to talk about Americans being spied upon by the U.S. government; they would call you a ""tin foil hat wearing..."" If you DID talk about that notion, you may find yourself out of the promotion pool, the dating pool, etc.  (This is a result of evolutionary forces).  Once Snowden's smoking gun revelations became accepted, the tribal beliefs changed - and those same bully's (status quo enforces) no longer had that power (because their power relies on the CURRENT beliefs of the masses).  Remember, the bully isn't a person who uses reason and evidence - they DO NOT CARE - so realize that arguing with them using facts and persuasive, rational arguments will likely end up a waste of your time.  They have one social function:  enforcing the status quo of average beliefs.  Move on.

Same concept with prepping for COVID-19.  It's shameful to prep - so most people will either NOT prep (so they don't face self-shame) , not admit to it, and certainly not encourage it IN ANY PLACE THAT MAY RESULT IN OSTRACISM.

Now...should things go pear-shaped and preppers proven right, maybe...just maybe, the beliefs of society will change and preparing won't be a shameful, socially risky, thing to do.  And I'll tell you a secret...

The most serious preppers I've ever met are U.S. government folks with first or secondhand knowledge regarding how bad things can get.  Yeah...those folks (many with expertise) you think of as serving the public or protecting you...a lot of them won't publicly say what they are privately doing.  Take that into consideration."

So to compare, you have an over 2000x higher chance of needing hospitalization if you get SARS 2 compared to the seasonal flu.

20x higher death rate, almost 2100x higher hospitalization rate. Awesome."

And just generally and anecdotally you see that as most people don't experience much viral illness in the hottest parts of the summer, especially after it hits 100+.  Trump has been saying an April relief but for complete resolution I'd suspect more like July and August for part of the US that is.  Now if there is a theoretical scenario where this virus has been scientifically modified to be more heat stable then that's a different story..But even then I can't imagine how they'd be able to get this thing all that much more heat stable than that given host requirements."

> When the first cases started turning up in the city of Wuhan in mid-December, two weeks before the official disclosure on December 31 that there was a new virus, sick people were turned away from local hospitals and sent home to infect other people and die.

> A top-level edict went out in early February instructing Chinese media managers that it was time for &quot;Telling the moving stories of how those on the frontline are preventing and fighting the virus&quot; and &quot;Showcasing the unity of the Chinese people in the face of the virus&quot;.

> &quot;People do not believe the official version because of the long-standing tradition of the Chinese Communist Party to hide the facts and glorify the supposed achievements of the top leaders.

They're always on call, they have to go in when they're needed, even when they're at home with their family. 

I get what you mean by ""sticking around and getting a good immune system"". I think you're talking about immune memory response. This only really works if the doctor actually gets sick from the patient, and creates antibodies that remembers the microbe, thus strengthening the immune system (I don't know how much you know about science so I simplified it).

I can't speak too much to Japanese health law as I'm unfamiliar. But in most if not all 1st world countries you can be detained and/or have your movement restricted if you are considered a threat to the health and safety of others.

I‚Äôm a bit of a health nut so it‚Äôs very simple. 

Plants + Protein

Fruits. Veggies. Nuts. Seeds. = Plants

Protein = Choose your preference. 

We tend to get lots of our protein from lentils or chickpeas or peas. 

Sometimes I‚Äôll buy a whey supplement but overall we take very few and rely on a very clean diet first and foremost. We sort of flop week by week.. vegan to eggs, milk and chicken. 

We don‚Äôt ‚Äòidentify‚Äô dietarily as anything other than health nuts. 

A pure veggie diet helps me heal faster, sleep better and as far as libido... well.. let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm big on plant based... ha ha ha. 

Translated to grocery shopping for this it means lots of fruit, lots of veggies, and dried or canned versions of each. 

Lentils. Chickpeas. Beans. 

Cashews. Peanuts. Almonds. Pistachios. 

We also stock up on frozen fruits like berries or when we eat meat, chicken, etc.. We‚Äôve got a bunch of frozen chicken in the freezer right now. 

Safest bet are dried or canned though if your goal is preparation. 

If power goes out frozen & fresh foods will all need to be eaten pretty quick. 

Right now we are still buying fresh as much as we can but with all this going down we also pick up extra canned, dried or frozen versions every time we do a food run. Slowly building and keeping a stockpile up a little at a time. 

Overall we keep it pretty simple. 

Hope this helps."

In 1983, seat belt use in the US was only at 14% even though the benefit of saving lives and the cost of disobedience still existed then. Today, seat belt use is at around 90%, so the habit of the majority has dramatically changed over the past 2 generations. 

Habits take time to break, especially at a societal level. Even though there is a lot of cynicism when it comes to China, I'm more optimistic that there might be lasting change this time. The Chinese government and everyday people are taking this epidemic very seriously, and the financial, social, and human cost of the quarantine is a wake up call for everyone there."
