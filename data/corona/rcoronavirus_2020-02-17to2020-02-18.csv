A sub has no financial motivation to do so. Mods are trying to keep this fact-based, and ""the fact it's a possible weapon"" is not a fact. Everything is possible, that doesn't make it ""a fact"". It's a misleading use of words. Like saying ""I deliver only facts, like the fact I'm full of BS.""

It's a possible bioweapon? I mean everything is possible, isn't it? ""The coronavirus is a possible human extermination attack by aliens trying to take over the planet"". Is it a fact this is possible? I mean, it's possible, however unlikely. Should we discuss it here? No.

The ""biological weapon"" theories are useless because they're not actionable. They don't help us understand the virus, they don't help us fight it, or prepare for it. If it was a textbook ""bioweapon"" then the cure would be available, and China wouldn't let it spread to & kill so many people and having to quarantine millions in attempt to slow it down.

Let's say it's a bioweapon regardless. What are you gonna do with that? Stop pointing the finger at bats and start pointing it to Chinese labs? Will that make you feel better? It sure won't do shit for curbing the outbreak."

2020-02-17,CaptainFentanyl,Coronavirus,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f51lh9/shenzhen_factory_just_told_me_on_hold_till_virus/fhwhzot/,"Several companies that supplies my place of work who ship from Hong Kong and mainland China and some personal business associates shipping the same region have advised us to expect delays and we have experienced late and still unaccounted for deliveries of laboratory equipment, bulk and specialty chemical precursors. 
Oddly we received samples (very expensive, microgram quantities) of nCoV and other coronavirus antigens for laboratory use rather quickly as soon as they became available; this is probably due to the unprecedented scientific response to the new virus, we need these substances urgently to experiment with to confirm/refute properties of the new virus calculated using molecular dynamics simulations and to discover new properties that could be exploited in the search for new therapeutics. 
Very rarely does in silico modelling perfectly predict the affinity of one substance has to bind to another based on calculation of interaction energies - performing binding assays in the lab allows us to measure empirically the strength of ligand-protein interactions for example, using reversible chemical reactions, one or more methods of accurately measuring very low concentrations of substances and a bit of calculation. 

In a research paper from a few years ago computer simulation was used to model docking between a wide range of strong opioid analgesic drugs (in the state they exist in the brain at physiological pH) and the Mu opioid receptor - the model predicted strong binding for only around 60% of them. It also predicted that Morphine wouldn’t bind very well at all and was expected to be a poor Mu ligand when of course we know and measure that this is not true, Morphine is objectively a strong analgesic and we measure it binding to the receptor with low nanomolar affinity. 

Anyway; nCoV spike binds to ACE2 but it’s binding domain is not the same as the ACE2 catalytic domain; nCoV doesn’t bind to what one would call ACE2’s active site where it acts as a zinc carboxypeptidase to remove a single amino acid from the end of Angiotensin peptide molecules. 
Some researchers are looking to discover ACE2-antibody conjugate drugs that would bind to nCoV blocking it from binding to cellular ACE2. We are looking for molecules that bind to ACE2 at the nCoV receptor binding domain that also preferably don’t interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2. 

Positive results from both of these research pathways would result in putative nCoV entry inhibitor drugs (a new class of drugs or several new classes) that can then be tested in animals and eventually humans. 
Vaccines are also another large research area however I am more interested in the classes of compounds I described earlier as vaccines most often are most useful before exposure to the virus enabling a more specific and rapid immune response - some have disease modifying effects in the already infected but they almost always must be given within hours of exposure to be most effective (rabies vaccine, smallpox vaccine) - so a vaccine probably isn’t going to be much use to the already infected especially since the rather long incubation period results in many people not realising that they were exposed until they have been infected for however many days it takes for them to have symptoms, some sources state this to be 1-14days and could be longer. 

Antiviral drugs, like the already existing classes of protease inhibitors RdRP inhibitors and hopefully nCoV entry inhibitors, if effective can be curative or disease modifying (preventing COVID-19 disease progression to severe pneumonia, ARDS and death) in even the most critically ill patients. 

The work continues and does so at a rapid pace, the number of molecules that we’re able to screen for ACE2 binding and then antiviral activity in such a short amount of time is incredible and wouldn’t have been possible 20+ years ago mainly due to great advancements in computing power available to researchers. 

Even if vaccines fail, I still don’t think all would be lost as I’m very confident that a range of effective antivirals with multiple targets and of multiple drug classes will eventually (likely quicker than usual) enter clinical practice just as the outbreak has allowed the use and study of unapproved or approved for other purpose substances, especially Remdesivir, to be used in patients that have no other option (compassionate use) and the already sick that consent to receiving an unapproved drug that has not completed the required clinical trials (investigational use in the sick patient with no other option that is still lucid enough to consent to be part of the experiment). 

So the new vaccine and therapeutic pathways to treatment at going as fast as they can; we really are. 
However; if nCoV gets significantly out of China (10000+ international cases) we may start to see variation in infectivity between people from different ethnic backgrounds - the expression of ACE2 varies amongst humans with East Asian populations expressing it most highly (in peer reviewed and preprint studies). 
And in addition to that; one of the greatest patient populations amongst white British people (where I’m based) is people with cardiovascular disease especially primary and smoking/diabetes/obesity induced hypertension. 
These people are well treated by modern medicine with a wide variety of CV drugs. Two that are of significance here are the ACE inhibitors (not ACE2) and the AT1 antagonists - two types of common antihypertensives prescribed in the west that work via inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensins-ACE-AT1 axis. A worrying feature of this confirmed in peer reviewed literature is that use of both classes of these drugs induces ACE2 expression. 

[Article](https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/73/3/463/367423) 

So those using these classes of drugs for CV disease may be more at risk along with the risk varying depending on ones racial background; CV drugs are well known for some classes being more effective for people of one racial background and another being more effective for people of a different racial background both suffering from similar CV conditions. 

The evidence isn’t all there yet with regards to nCoV infection but if the virus does go pandemic then to survive we are all eventually going to have to take risks; the research suggest that when taking those risks one should consider people close to you/that you live with taking ACE inhibitors or AT1 antagonists (and probably other classes of drugs) not only because they already have a pre-existing condition but because their treatment for it has been shown to induce ACE2 expression which may make them particular susceptible to nCoV. 

(All the above is just a bit more info on how treatments for nCoV can be discover and how susceptibility to infection most probably varies amongst humans. 
By no means is it a recommendation to stop taking any drugs that your doctor prescribes for you - as always only ever take or stop taking medication as your doctor prescribes. 
The science is constantly developing and more definite answers to all of these questions will come with time. And to further dissuade anyone using those two classes of CV drugs from stopping taking them to try’s and prevent nCoV infection in pandemic conditions; usage of ACE inhibitors and AT1 antagonists upregulates ACE2 expression over a longer period of time than the incubation period and even the course of COVID-19 disease; stopping using those drugs would not only be dangerous for your CV health and against your doctor’s prescription advice but also stopping taking them wouldn’t immediately eliminate all the upregualted ACE2 expression (ACE2 would only then be downregualted back to the unmedicated level over weeks to months as the expression of the ACE2 gene changes and the cells remove an recycle ACE2 from the cellular membranes - this is not an instantaneous effect, if you do use these CV drugs stopping using them will not help you nor is there evidence yet to prove that stopping them will help you even if you have 6 months notice before nCoV exposure)

Here’s hoping for restoration of normal length consignment deliveries from China as well as the improved health of the populations affected very soon. And if this doesn’t occur naturally; millions of us working in pharmaceuticals will not stop until we have more treatment options that drastically reduce the mortality rate (even if the only motivator for some is profit). 
I don’t particularly agree with profiteering from humanitarian crises; if written in here in the past regarding HIV patients that essentially now have to pay and subscribe to life. 
Without a definite cure for nCoV (or HIV for that matter) if my place of work produces a successful disease modifying drug or preventative non vaccine treatment for nCoV, I will argue that we give it away for a penny more than the cost it takes to produce it given the current epidemic. I will almost definitely lose that arguement and if nCoV infection and a drug to treat it become commonplace; a few people will become very rich; I won’t be one of them, but I certainly hope that my team at least gets to put their names to some of the research leading to the widespread use of a treatment that makes nCoV infection treatable with a mortality rate approaching zero."

Whether you believe the real number is 10x the reported or not -- it is trending down.  The CPP's draconian measure is distasteful to Western eyes nevertheless proves to work.   

Numbers in Japan and Singapore will increase.   But it will be under control.  Flights to these places may become restricted. 

Blood plasma from recovered patients will prove to work and the best form of using herd immunity.   As more recover more plasma treatment is available.

In the meantime drugs like remzir or other hiv antivirals will prove to be effective in treating patients and reducing the overall death rate.

There will be more 2ndary transmission cases in the west but nothing on the scale of crisis like in China.  Because everyone is taking precautions, transmission is limited due to public awareness.

By April. Life will return to normal outside of China but still  quarantine+isolation inside China.  The weather is warmer but the virus isn't going away because of that but rather there is now some herd immunity.

By Summer the Chinese economy will begin to normalize. 

Covid19 will become a regular part of the annual flu season. And folks will get vaccinated for it every year past 2021."

You’d want it to do exactly what it’s doing. To spread and go undetected as long as possible. A fast-acting lethal bio weapon would burn itself out too fast.

However, I do not believe it is a bio weapon that was released on purpose. Possibly not a bio weapon at all. At the moment (changes day to day), my best guess is either:

A) They we’re working on SARS vaccinations in the lab. They were testing on animals and who knows what else. Scientist accidentally gets infected. Has no idea. Spreads around for days/weeks unnoticed. Complete accident with zero bad intentions.

B) Researching bio weapons in the lab. Scientist got infected by accident. Has no idea. Same spread as above.

I do not believe this was done on purpose by anyone. If anything, they realized something got out, because it matched what they had in the lab, hence keeping it quiet to try and contain it on their own so no one knows or finds out. Spreads incredibly fast, quickly becomes out of control, and then there is a situation on their hands.

The fact that it was kept quiet for X weeks or a month or more is concern that they knew there was a big screw up and went into high gear trying to contain it without raising any flags. Blaming it on a wet market makes a plausible argument and takes eyes off of lab.

Someone (or many) know the truth. We will learn what the truth is someday, I believe. Until then, we can guess and argue all day about all our theories to no end. It’s pointless. None of know at the moment. Just learn what you can, keep reading and sifting through all the info, come up with your own theories and you’ll see in time if your guess was right."

So quoting media outlets to increase the count of ""reputable"" reports about bioweapons is kinda disingenuous .
 
Second, the ""evidence"" for the theory always seems to trace back to something grossly misinterpreted or the product of junk science or hucksters. Hell, even the anti-Vaxxer that 
 originally claimed to prove it wasn't naturally occurring had to withdraw that claim in the face of evidence.
 
Third, the absence of validation for your suspicions is not evidence that something is being hidden. The people most enthusiastic about this theory also often seem to hold other fringe beliefs. For example, I've been told that if only i knew the ""truth about 9/11"" I wouldn't doubt how all this Is being covered up too. Is it surprising that conversations that whipsaw from diagnostic criteria to illuminati rituals might need a heavier hand if the mods are at all concerned that the sub not be considered a complete joke?

Since the dawn of humanity, pandemics have two properties 1) virulent 2) deadly. If anything, we've had it way worse in the past (black plague). There's absolutely nothing in this virus to suggest ""unlikely"" properties.

Furthermore, how is expecting ""unlikely"" properties helping you? You either know what properties it has or you don't.

Last but not least how does it even make sense for China to fund a virulent strain for weapon purposes in the first place, save for everyone's paranoia abroad making up stories? China's entire national strategy for over a decade now is becoming a manufacturing hub for the world. It's of strategic importance for them that there is nothing to disrupt international trade. You know, things like wars or pandemics.

A good weapon isn't simply randomly destructive. It's targeted and accurate. In time, in space. Otherwise it's like pissing in the rain. A virus is an absolutely terrible weapon. Outside of sci-fi and horror movies. Even if you can get it to attack precisely who, where and when you want, it's still a virus. You can't control it.

More cases will pop up on local news levels but will likely be pushed as severe pneumonia and say there is no information if this is related to the Covid-19 coronavirus.  Many more will get sick in the US and many will brush it off like it's nothing and they will spread it.  In about 4-6 weeks, it will finally hit the news and majority of US residents will start questioning things and asking what we have been asking weeks ago in this forum.  I think in some major cities, school districts will push for a 14-day quarantine and broadcast in school packets that go to the parents and on local news to go to a clinic or call a local emergency number if symptoms become severe.

I don't think there will be a panic until people are collapsing in the streets and state/city/gov't officials cannot simply say this was a nasty flu this season.  I imagine there to be medical supply shortages of medicines (prescribes & OTC) and antibiotics near the end of March to early May.

What's worse is that, I think the reinfection is going to kill a LOT of people.  Surviving the initial infection is tough from what I've read regarding what it does and what people have said but a re-infection could amplify the damaged areas of the body and lead to death by asphyxiation or internal bleeding.

I don't have sources to back up my claims but I've watched and read lots of videos/articles on this thing and have been following since January.  As long as this virus is in a host that is alive, the human race is in danger.

Once this phase is active, then it'll be time to draw predictions for phase 2. What happens when 5%-10%-30% of the population is gone and resources get scarce."

I agree, and population density is going to play a huge part of it as well. Yes, there are densely populated areas, but Wuhan is a huge city with a huge population. In the US, only 6 *States* have populations larger than Wuhan, and with the exception of 2, all are either larger, or multiple-times larger than Wuhan itself.

One other thing I think people need to remember is, there are a lot of ""ray's of hope"" when it comes to treatment, from early results from blood transfusions to Remdesivir (and even the [feline version of this medication](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f4pwz7/feline_coronavirus_treatment_could_stop_spread_of/) shows hope) Every day that passes, yes, we have more infections, but we're one day closer to a treatment as well."

That does not change the fact that Wet Markets are a sanitary disaster waiting to happen, and that many different types of animals are illegally traded by chinese for their meat, for status/face/bribes, and for traditional medicine (aka not medicine, not scientific at all.)

Trading wildlife animals like they are pokemon cards has no place in the modern world if you ask me. In fact I find most meat consumption to be unnecessary and illogical(I understand that rural village people must rely heavily on animals to survive, but factory farming is absolutely unnecessary) as well as the sale of real fur from farmed animals, its disgusting and not needed anymore in this world. Our ancestors relied on animal commodities because they were neccesary for survival, but we have many alternatives now. Compassion for other species on this planet is needed if we are to avert the planetary disaster that we humans have created.

I am actually pretty uninformed about this topic but I am aware that wildlife trading in China is a 20+ billion dollar industry. If I had to guess I would say that it is old chinese people that support this horrible industry, not the younger generation. I imagine this industry will die with the older generation, and it can not end soon enough."

Bad news: 

* We need them for specific events, receiving them after the event makes the stuff practically worthless. We paid good amount of money to be a part of these events, without the goods, we would get bad return on investment. 
* According to our legal department, we can't just cancel the orders and have to take the goods or make other arrangements.
* Not only the factories are shut down, the complete supply chain and logistics has grind to halt. Getting this up and running again might take some time. I expect a huge backlog in the ports.

Good news:

* Apparantly some factories did start up production again on the 10th of Feb after being audited. They are working at minimal capacity, but they are churning out products.
* Other factories the offices are manned again. While most work from home, more and more people come back to the office now. This might be a sign that also their production lines start running again soon (they promised the 17th).

I think the important thing on a practical level is that THERE IS NO REASON TO GO TO THE ER OR EVEN YOUR DOCTOR’S OFFICE UNLESS YOUR SYMPTOMS ARE TRULY SEVERE AND YOU NEED TO BE ADMITTED.  Otherwise, you basically just exposed a lot of vulnerable people to your viral illness, and all you needed were some medications for symptoms that were already available over-the-counter. This is true whether it’s common cold, flu, or COVID2019

I get it if you’d feel your symptoms are severe and are not sure you can manage at home - or if you have underlying lung disease, immune suppression, or elderly and frail. But SO many patients just go in because they feel sick and want “something” for their mild-moderate viral illness, as if it’ll go away with antibiotics or something.

I paid rent this month but my Landlord did text us before we did and said if you don't have it this month you can pay later. 
I know a couple of people that were completely let of rent this month which is a good news story, but unfortunately not every landlord will be this nice. 

There was a lady in Shenzhen who let a lot of people of their rent and took a ¥500,000 hit. I think that's around $50,000 dollars.

I do feel for all the workers in the hospitality and f&b sectors as a lot would be paid hourly and not contract. 
Thankfully I haven't noticed price inflation to much with reference to groceries and things like that, some veg has increased slightly as they are a little harder to get but not crazy price jumps.  This is due to the government monitoring this and if you are caught hiking prices you will be fined and it's not a small fine. 

The banks have postponed mortgage and credit card payments if you need to. They have also said there won't be interest on over due payment and it won't be added to your credit score so you won't be penalized. You do need to apply for it through the banking apps and let them know, otherwise they can't just say 'ok everyone no need to pay this month'."

For example. See, I live in hurricane territory. The kind where we've had several local-ish landfalls in the last decade. 

*And yet,* when the most recent hurricane warning went through, I was the sole person in my family/acquaintance group thinking 'evacuate'. 

There was a definite pattern. Locals who lived in trailers, manufactured homes - they left. Locals who lived in stick-builts, brick homes - they stayed.

We did evacuate. We were one of the few to head west. Most of those who evacuated headed north - to the nearest big city. North was the same direction as the incoming storm, and yet most people headed that way. We went straight west. Drove for an hour and a half, holed up, the storm went overhead as nothing worse than a summer thunderstorm.

People made fun. ""Ahhh, look at the northerner, they see a lil' 'cane and they running."" I didn't grow up in a hurricane zone. I grew up a couple hours south of the Canadian border, I'm not used to hurricanes. The locals were. They'd been hit, as aforementioned, a few times in the past decade. This was old hat to them. 

They'd been there. They'd done that. They thought I was silly to evacuate because they'd been hit by hurricanes before and *never needed to evacuate*. 

The locals were experienced. Unfortunately, they were experienced in exactly the sort of plan that works right up until it doesn't. The 'cane swipes had been smaller, they'd been indirect. This time, the hurricane's eye went straight over my town. As a Cat4. My spouse's parents had planned to ride it out at home - within *sight* of the bay!- and only went to the brick home of an uncle because I got ""silly"" and was insistent. The uncle's home started disintegrating, and they had to decamp for safer grounds as the hurricane's eye went overhead. 

When services finally came back up, we told people we were grateful for the minimal damage to our property. For a few weeks, we had the nicest house in town - it had a roof over every room. 

Risk assessment, y'all... it's a weird, weird thing."

Hadn’t thought about the oats! Great idea! 

I like that you mention the fasting! I’m currently on an intermittent fasting regimen, so I only eat about once a day as it is. My son doesn’t eat too much either. I think that’s part of WHY I’m procrastinating is because I feel like we have food to eat and won’t go through it all. But I can also see how variety of food could be important. I’m also surprised more people don’t talk about fasting during this. Probably  because they associate it with starving? 

I’m not usually a can food person, more of a shop the outside aisles of the grocery store. I usually buy fresh so I’m also having to contend with that, but food is food, especially if your options are limited. We do have a ton of cereal, however I eventually realized we would run out of milk... canned milk (condensed I guess) would be the next option? Plus I don’t hear anyone else talking about cereal... again I have no idea here. 

As far as the job, I’ve actually been out on a medical leave and short term disability should be kicking in soon. 

This is actually providing some relief as it lessens people I will be in contact with."

I was wondering if I could borrow your brain to think about a specific herbal intervention to try and attenuate the severity of symptoms caused by respiratory viruses. [Meta-Analytic work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30670267) and [more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848651/) [than one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15080016) double blind controlled trials have shown that elderberry supplementation reduces the severity and in some cases the duration of symptoms of respiratory illness, especially for respiratory viruses. Do you have any notion what might account for these results on a molecular biological level, and if the herb may be a useful poor man's treatment for the present respiratory illness?

when you have billionaires like David Tepperr telling you to be cautious with your investments, you might want to listen!

Lie about the numbers
Buy time to plan
Don’t have to worry about chaos and panic while planing . 
Keep it under wraps as long as we can before we call it what it is. (No control/pandemic)

I’m concerned about the shortages of PPE that is requiring staff to wear their PPE all day. In an ideal world PPE is put on before entering an isolation room, and removed upon leaving. Now they’re wearing the same PPE gear for their entire shift, carrying the virus from patient to patient and spreading it around the hospital. And they clearly don’t have enough isolation rooms. So I’m not surprised staff are catching it in high numbers. You’d have to assume that every surface and object in the hospital is contaminated at this point. Same problem exists for any government or medical  staff interacting with multiple possible cases a day. It doesn’t look like they’re changing gloves, mask, gowns between patients.

A lot.

For me it hinges on two things: by what factor have the Chinese lied about numbers and how likely is it that the pre-lockdown exodus from Wuhan hasn't already spread this worldwide. 

Nobody knows (or will ever know) about the true Chinese numbers but their reaction (large numbers on lockdown, increased measures for Hubei, etc.) isn't matching the severity of the official numbers.

Re. my second point - my mind keeps popping back to that image of the air travel destinations before travel bans were implemented. This may have already gotten everywhere, given what we know about relative ease of infectivity, and how many people travelled everywhere, I don't think that's too controversial a statement. Has there been a global jump in pneumonia cases that hasn't yet been attributed to covid-19? 


Clusters will pop up in the US/UK/Europe this week. Community testing is in effect in several British cities (seen Glasgow and Manchester confirmed by their local health boards, which means other cities with 1m+ population will likely be the same.)  This represents a shift in how we in the UK are looking for cases, adding weight to the theory that senior officials believe it's here already.

Japan will be the country most affected outside of China (in the coming weeks)

They have several community outbreaks, a floating death ship on their coast line and a strategy that seems more focused towards keeping the Olympics and saving face internationally, than protecting their population. A population that has the highest life expectancy and cities with some of the highest population density in the world, it should be noted. The Tokyo marathon is still going ahead on March the 1st at time of writing. 

Compare their reaction to that of Korea or Singapore - I think the next few weeks will be very testing for Japan, and their Gov't will need to change strategy or risk health systems becoming overwhelmed."

Our city has actually confirmed a case. How worried am I? Honestly, almost not at all. 

The downplaying is a counter-reaction to the ridiculous fearmongering done by unhappy, nihilistic losers who hope the current world order ends.

I'm sorry, but this too shall brush over. Yes it might be a big historical event or it might not. But life goes on.

It doesn't prevent it. But slowing down the spread is good. It means more serious cases can be treated in hospitals that still have the capacity to deal with these dangerously-contagious patients. It's when it spreads quickly that hospitals are overwhelmed and everything starts fraying at the edges.

It would have been better to keep out potential spreaders, perhaps. Until more is understood about transmission, long-term consequences of damaged cells in male testes, in the kidneys, lungs and hearts, of those who contract the illness. We still don't have enough information to confirm that a month-long quarantine is sufficient, as there's one case of a woman who may have had a 42-day ""incubation period"" (although it seems perhaps more likely that she was exposed to a now-known infected person 42 days ago, maybe had mild symptoms she ignored or failed to really notice, and then was reinfected later by an unknown asymptomatic-spreader and developed symptoms that landed her in the hospital where she was diagnosed)."

(I usually avoid using masks. I don't really like wearing them.) Surprisingly, I still see only about half of people in public wearing masks. Japan is well-known for having a mask-wearing culture, but right now the number doesn't seem to be all that much higher than normal for this season. (This might also be due to the low number of stores that currently have masks available.)

Personally I also have hand sanitizer at work and at home that I am using after I touch pretty much anything that anyone else ever touches.

I'm surprised how little precaution most people seem to be taking at this point. Seems like most are not watching the news very closely, and still think this just some rare illness from China. They think the relatively low number of reported cases currently on mainland Japan (61) means that it is still a rare illness that they have a very low chance of getting. I suspect few understand that there are almost certainly asymptomatic and contagious people all around us as we speak.

It is business as usual for most people. Only a few companies have started work-from-home, and I guess a few more are doing staggered commutes.

First thing to remember is keep a level head. Right now what most people are prepping for are supply shortages. So heres your Checklist of things to get.

Clothing - We are moving into spring - summer, So making sure you have proper clothing for your weather will be a must. Prepare to wear clothing to what your general areas ambiant temperature will be. This. will make sure you will be prepared incase central air breaks down and parts are hard to obtain.

Basic Medical kits - Every home should have one of These. Nothing to fancy, but enough incase you say you slice your hand pretty bad, but you think you can avoid the ER type kit. Put a thing of superglue with that kit. 

Home Supplies - 1 Lightbulb for every room of your home. Incase one burns out, its good to have another. You might even want to take the opportunity to upgrade to some nice LED bulbs! 9V Batteries. Its that time to change your smoke alarms anyway!

Torch/Flashlights. Make sure you have 1 small flashlight per room. Packs of 4 where still going for about 15$ at homedepot. 1 or 2 Nice flashlights or lanterns. While your at it, grab a bag of tea candles.

If you have central air, Find and mesure your air filter. Go ahead and spend a bit of extra money to get one of those nice M3 Hepa filters.

Personal Hygiene and cleaning care items. Including Dishwashing and clothing.

Its up to you if you want to get medical n95 masks or not. Personally if your handy with a sewing machine or just crafty, you can make face protection that will be just as good if not better then those medical masks. Im Making my own custom fit masks just because i need something to do.

Hobby items you where planning on doing this year. If theres any fun activity such as puzzles, books or other things you may want, Gather those up. Mention to your son think about some offline activity he might want to do. If we have power outages due to whatever reason, just have something to do. 

If you have pets, make sure you have food and supplies for the next 6 months incase of supplie chain breakdowns or missed deliveries. 

As far as food supplies, 40 pounds of rice, 10 pounds of dry beans, And a few gallons of chicken stock. Couple bags of all purpose bread flour, and dry egg substitute and dehydrated milk. Shop weekly and keep track of prices on what products are going up and down.

Cash on hand funds. Start to gather as much Physical cash in 5 or 10$ crisp bills from the bank. Do this until you have enough cash on hand for 3 weeks of food paid via cash. 

Finally, Dont worry, Dont panic and keep a level head. Dont spend your self into oblivion to get prepared."

So what I normally buy, is fresh foods. Fresh produce, meat, no canned stuff. 

Okay to be honest I do have ramen and cereal on hand for the boy to eat as a quick meal.

So I have to reassess what we will eat since the food I normally make will not be available, (where I feel I’m getting stuck). Like people say buy beans, and I’m thinking why not buy canned chili? Like I’m gonna need to enjoy food."

Beans and rice are good because it's a solid source of protein, which is going to be important. If you eat nothing or junk, your body will go into starvation mode. But if you consume a little bit of protein, your body will compensate it with your bodyfat if you're not eating enough food. Fat people can starve to death, that's why it's important to get that daily source of protein. But we're talking about extreme circumstances here.

So a bag of beans and a bag of rice, your favorite chili sauce and various other ingredients. Salt/pepper make otherwise terrible food tolerable. You'll be surprised what you'll be willing to eat when you're hungry.

And why not buy some canned goods, they're not terribly expensive. If you end up not needing them after a couple months donate them to the boy scouts when they come around for their canned food drives. But it's important to only buy something you would consider eating."

They just chose not to mine for them, due to getting them elsewhere. Mining, refining and processing rare earth metals causes massive amounts of pollution. It's a dirty process that requires large infrastructure and most countries would rather pay for it instead.

China isn't the only country able to do what it does. It's production facilities are already in place and functioning with cheap rates, so most countries buy from it.

The second China stops another country like India will take it's place. I wouldn't be surprised if India takes it's place in 20 years with the rate they are moving.

feels like theyre buying time to make it appear more gradual, but i realize thats the eager little conspiracy theorist in the back of my head who always likes to come out and play when this sort of shit is going down."

But doesn’t apply to Australia.   We don’t have that policy.

1,175 people have been tested in NSW alone (4 cases found).  Population 7.554 million.  Translated into “US figures”, that’s be the equivalent of the CDC testing 57,894.  (The CDC have actually tested 443 and found 15 cases.) In “Singapore figures” it’d be the equivalent of 874 tests (Singapore has actually tested 946 and found 75 cases).

Unlike everywhere else, Australia doesn’t really have one big CDC equivalent, it’s all state based.   So the other states might not have the same stats.   (Last time I saw Victoria data it was pretty close to NSW figures, they just don’t update as regularly/openly.).  But at least one of our states is testing on a scale similar to that of Singapore.  If we’re still missing cases, then everyone is screwed, because it would imply that it’s going undetected *everywhere*."

And we have been on this planet for so long it is very unlikely this virus will wipe us out. It is possible but chances are so low it is not even worth mentioning.

But anyway. It will 100% have a huge impact on the economy for sure. Also chinas image will change /has changed and willl continue to do so depending on how it will go moving forward.


But the most interesting thing is. This might be the first time where the flood of information does so much damage. Everyone is saying something different and no one knows who to believe.

Do masks prevent the spread of a disease from an infected person to a non-infect person? Absolutely. Do masks provide protection against contracting the disease? Some, and more depending on the sophistication of the mask.  


We agree with respect to the sanitizing of commonly used spaces then. The fact the company would discourage their employees from doing this when customers are around DURING A PANDEMIC is asinine. They should absolutely be sued into the dirt when all is said and done."

Because honestly I'm struggling to think of many (or even any really).

My company (a multi-national Fortune 100 company) made a whole bunch of plans that got shelved the moment China tariffs were called off / reduced.  

But know that the plans that *were* in the works at my company were solely targeted at creating alternate final assembly sites to circumvent the Made In China tag.  Nothing else upstream from a supply chain standpoint was even considered as a possible change because the scope of complexity is enormous.

Think of all the individual components that go into making a cell phone, a personal computer, a car, and on and on.  Not only does the factory that puts it all together need to be staffed & operational, but so must every single supplier factory for every single component.  And nearly all of these smaller supplier factories are also in China.

You can bet that nearly every executive boardroom across the globe is meeting daily to discuss this exact problem and how to mitigate it.

And if this really does go far enough down the road where real, large scale, durable diversification does start to occur, the results could change China's economy **dramatically**.  Because once these kinds of moves start to happen, there's no guarantee that they'll come back if/when the virus situation improves in China.

Death rates in China are declining -- I expect they will reach only single or low double digit growth in the next few weeks.  That means that the crisis has stabilized and that the hospitals there have the capacity to treat the most severe cases.

In the US the only fear is that of hospitals not being prepared if a localized outbreak occurs.  So know at least 10 hospitals that you can go to if you or your family show symptoms.  And in the mean time practice isolation -- avoid large social events -- use public bathrooms etc.   

We will be fine.

It's not like general computing or smartphones or tablets where you did get automation through those devices but you got it in a standardized manner that was not very industry-specific.

When it comes to automating factories some of it will be fairly straightforward, but some of it will be very complex and it's just going to take a lot of money and man hours to actually make so many upgrades that you really see the impact as significant.

Plus there has to be enough profit in it for people to actually care. yeah they could automate, but it's going to cost them billions of dollars and upgrades and then China's still going to be trying to compete with them for the low price which is going to continue to be annoying automation or not.

automation on the manufacturing side helps, but you need automation on the mining and resource harvesting side because China has cheap labor everywhere not just in fact. China can get all the domestic resources cheaper than America and then they can get cheaper factory labor too.

So really yeah it'll eventually happen, but it's nowhere near that close where China is entire economy couldn't drop by 50% and then recover before we've significantly switched over to automation.

Plus keep in mind the more time it suffers economically the cheaper their labor gets.

If China simply entices people with cheaper labor you know pretty well what's going to happen, they're just going to go for the lowest bidder.

Yeah yeah yeah you might lose some money for a couple months, but the person paying the cheaper labor will make it up over the course of a couple years at most so that's probably the route that prefer plus you know like I set up time and you can keep all the pollution over in China which is a significant benefit.

for full automation you also need like automated environmental cleanup to go with your automated factories or you're still bringing back pollution to your country that wasn't there before so you better be making the product a lot cheaper or something to really see it as a significant net gain."

The point at which to control this was a few months ago in China. Something this contagious, with this amount of numbers, and this long of an incubation period can't be shut down, even if we want to panic now and lock down freedom of movement entirely. The CDC has been talking about a control strategy to blunt the worst of cases. That's where the focus is, not stopping this.

Some of the more recent estimates ([https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v1) \- disclaimer: still yet to be peer reviewed) are saying that 40% of cases are being detected entering the country. Many of the tests for this virus have a huge false negative rate, and some people have to be tested several times before they get a positive result back. 

If they test the major cities, and find a few cases, there's sure to be more out there. In a few weeks, it'll be spreading rapidly already. I guess the question is, is it better to be aware of the spread more gradually, or get the news all at once when the exponential spread begins to hit us.

It's just a bad situation. Money vs. safety isn't a clear breakdown at this point. It's here, probably at a low level. How do we best handle that news, as a society, without panicking? How do we look out for the most vulnerable? And prepare ourselves, reasonably, and not relying on unfortunate pop culture references involving zombie infection, to handle this materially and psychologically?"

When this and other subreddits were created, one of the first issues that arose was the propagation of fake news, conspiracy theories, and so on and so forth.  The difficulty in ascertaining what's real and what's not has never become so blurred in our lifetime.  Information comes so quickly, it would almost be considered irresponsible to allow conspiracy theories and memes to coexist with relevant and important information.  Due to this, after discussing this with other moderators, it appears that bans were handed out to immediately stop the proliferation of damaging information / memes that could be construed as serious, inappropriately racially divisive, or harmful to serious discussions.  

And part of the reactive response on our part was to create filters for our automod (i.e., bioweapons).  I specifically asked the older mods about the bans for discussing bioweapons, and the consensus has been that no one has been banned *at all* for discussing bioweapons.  However, there is an active filter due to the issues the cropped up as indicated above.

This is why we created /r/COVID19 to try and encourage scientific discussions, while using /r/coronavirus as a general discussion platform.  

-------------------------------------------------------------

That being said: As a mod team, we are definitely not immune from criticism.  A few mistakes were made and that it wasn't discussed freely with the community in mind was a mistake.  What is a reputable news source?  What are banned phrases?  What would lead to a ban?  There are things we are actively seeking to improve, with regards to both what sources can be used, and how we filter certain keywords or phrases.  To be honest, our fear is allowing this subreddit and others like it falling trap to the propagation of fake news and becoming quarantined like certain subreddits I won't name here. Reddit's policy has been to not allow threats or discussions of death or violence that are discussed irresponsibly and harmfully.  To that end, some of the bans we've implemented were due to that.  Other bans were due to sensationalized headlines (editorialized), or proliferation of news that could not be verified (Youtube videos), spamming, and so on and so forth.  This is why certain subreddits were quarantined.

-------------------------------------------------------------

It's a tough position trying to ensure content is being posted and discussed responsibly while trying to be hands off as well.  As a new subreddit, it's a maturing process we are trying to speed up a bit with the number of new moderators we've brought on board. 

Discussion about this subject needs to continue and should be able to continue without interference.  Our issue is that the discussion of this will inevitably lead to outlandish conspiracy theories as some of you have noted in this thread and other threads.  How do we manage that kind of content without impacting our user experience and maintaining a platform that encourages that discussion?

As always, feedback is appreciated."

It represents a degree of possibility but it doesn't always represent the actual outcome for every region. There are a few possible reasons why Australia hasn't had any new cases as suggested by others. It's hard to gauge the situation right now because there is still so much uncertainty and we have fairly limited information from the government (I live in Vic and haven't heard a thing here). Personally I do find it odd that we have no new cases. It's possible that the potential cases are either being dismissed as flu or that we are simply not testing any (I'm not entirely sure if the number of tested performed included the evacuees or not, maybe someone can correct me on this), but you also have to consider that maybe we were lucky to be able to contain the spread before it even began in Australia.

You're losing your job because you work for a company who hasn't diversified their source of supply, who hasn't planned for contingencies, who hasn't managed the company's finances or the company's growth particularly well.  Sometimes it's called ""floundering in prosperity"".  I could make this a really long post explaining all the (not-too-uncommon) business mistakes that were made here.  

There are many business models that ""work"" just as long as some really precarious conditions continue to allow it to ""work"".  But the minute those gracious circumstances change, they are gone.  One could wonder,  was it really a good business model if it was so fragile?  Perhaps it could have been a good business model if, after their initial success, they quickly got to work bulletproofing the business.  Or did the owners drag cash out of the company relying on cheap product from a single supplier in China to keep flowing forever?  The devil is in the details.  

ISO certifications and good manufacturing processes for medical products companies address some of these issues supply chain issues.   When companies aren't built to last, everyone loses.  Customers, owners, trading partners, taxpayers, and employees. 

Someone in China, having just lost their spouse to COVID-19, may lose their factory job because your company couldn't plan for supply chain contingencies and won't be around now to order parts when things improve.  But if it truly leaves a void in the market for hearing aids, someone else will jump in to meet demand.  Or, perhaps likely, once your company clears out some debt and overhead they will try to reemerge in some modified form."

Obviously there are ""gross errors” and ""wild assumptions"" in this calculation. 

Remember there are 1.4 billion people in China being helped by the short term reduction of air pollution.

A 2015 study from the non-profit organization Berkeley Earth estimated that 1.6 million people in China die each year from heart, lung and stroke problems because of polluted air. 

Let’s say we clean the air by 66.7% for 3 months just in China or 16.675% less pollution “averaged"" over 1 year.

If we break it down for just the 1 year. 1,600,000 normally die and 16.675% less would be 266,800 less deaths."

However the most important factor I'd consider would be how much you like the way they taste, since you will probably want to eat them at some point.  

Gradually introducing them into your diet is a good idea, rather than suddenly switching over.  Also a lot of dried soup type things that are available and fairly inexpensive, lentils etc, contingent on a moderately abundant water supply. 

Consider how well they bake, fry, boil.

Oats are another pretty inexpensive cheap staple, although they also require cooking water.  Big advantage of beans is that they are a protein source with significant amounts of anti-oxidants, vitamins and minerals of various types.  

Personally I'd suggest researching a bit, and go with things you know you like well enough to be able to eat them for an extended period of time if you have to.  Something can be said for variety, even small flavor changes can make you feel like there's some sort of changes happening with your food, which is psychologically important."
