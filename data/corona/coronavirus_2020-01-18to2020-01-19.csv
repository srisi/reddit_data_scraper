I just finished my degree in Immunology and Infectious Disease and I spent a couple years working in a virology lab. 

There's multiple ways an old virus can become dangerous again. There's something called genetic drift, where the virus will change slowly over time as it mutates. If it mutates enough, it will appear to be a completely new virus to your immune system and can lead to you getting sick, despite being almost the same virus as before. This is why you have to get a flu shot every year to stay protected. 

There's also genetic shift, which is when the virus changes extremely fast. This is usually caused when a strain of the virus recombines with another strain of the virus, creating a completely new and unique virus. This usually happens inside of an animal. 

In this case, the coronavirus probably underwent genetic shift by recombining with another strain of coronavirus inside an animal. Asian countries are typically known to have poorer health standards when it comes to handling live animals, especially in live animal markets."

RNA is really supposed to be a short term messenger, not a long term storage system for genetic information the way DNA is. It’s relatively unstable, increasing the mutation rate. So coronavirus would have a high mutation rate compared even to DNA viruses.


This is similar to why we need a new influenza vaccine every year, and we have no hepatitis C vaccine"

2020-01-18,Ivacaftor,Virology,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virology/comments/eqldqv/with_current_wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak_in_mind/fetpqx8/,"So generally speaking when you think of virus discovery there are 3 major ways that you can do this. The first one is by looking at serology and seeing if there are antibodies that might crossreact with your virus of interest. So you would take a patient's blood and then test the effectiveness of antibodies, which would give you an idea about the family of the virus and what it is similar to (most new viruses are very similar to known viruses, like the Wuhan virus is very similar to SARS for example). A second way that is commonly used is EM. Using EM on a virus particle can help you identify which virus family it is from. Finally, another key way is to do PCR assays set up for the different families. This is how MERS-CoV was first identified for example, where it was positive for a coronavirus specific PCR. This technique relies on conserved sequences that are conserved throughout the whole family of viruses.

Now as for the sequencing of the virus, there are again many different ways that you can do this. Once you know the virus family, you can use primers for the possible genes in conserved regions that just run a PCR and sequence the outcome. This has been applied to highly similar viruses and I presume (I am not sure) this is what was used for the Wuhan virus.

Another common technique that was used for NL63 which is a human coronavirus for example is AFLP. This is a PCR based technique that allows for sequencing relatively random sequences. Finally, another common method is RAP PCR, this technique uses random primers and if you sequence this and have a suitable cut off, you can slowly assemble the viral genome. This was used to identify the sequence of human metapneumovirus for example. 

I have to say, the Wuhan sequence was kinda sloppily done, it actually had a large human sequence that was an artefact from the assembly and it usually takes a few months to get a real ""representable"" sequence for a virus as it is usually initially done on a single virus isolated from a patient. Nevertheless, it is really cool and definitely a field of virology that is quite dope imo.

EDIT: Also, there are probably tons of other ways to do this. Please feel free to add other ways to do this!

Second EDIT: This paper is pretty good and explains more methods and everything in more detail. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4534817/"

There have been nearly 50 confirmed cases of the new virus, but UK experts estimate the figure is closer to 1,700.
Two people are known to have died from the respiratory illness, which appeared in Wuhan city in December. 
""I am substantially more concerned than I was a week ago,"" disease outbreak scientist, Prof Neil Ferguson, said.
The work was conducted by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, which advises bodies including the UK government and the World Health Organization.
■   'Sars-family' virus claims second victim in China
■   Mystery Chinese virus: How worried should we be?
Singapore and Hong Kong have been screening air passengers from Wuhan and US authorities announced similar measures starting on Friday at three major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.
How were the numbers calculated?
The crucial clue to the scale of the problem lies in the cases being detected in other countries.
While the outbreak is centred on the central Chinese city of Wuhan, there have been two cases in Thailand and one in Japan. 
""That caused me to worry,"" said Prof Ferguson.
He added: ""For Wuhan to have exported three cases to other countries would imply there would have to be many more cases than have been reported.""
It is impossible to get the precise number, but outbreak modelling, which is based on the virus, the local population and flight data, can give an idea. 
Wuhan International Airport serves a population of 19 million people, but only 3,400 a day travel internationally.
The detailed calculations, which have been posted online ahead of publication in a scientific journal, came up with a figure of 1,700 cases. 
What does it all mean?
Prof Ferguson said it is ""too early to be alarmist"" but he was ""substantially more concerned"" than a week ago.
Chinese officials say there have been no cases of the virus spreading from one person to another. 
Instead they say the virus has crossed the species barrier and come from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. 
Prof Ferguson argues: ""People should be considering the possibility of substantial human-to-human transmission more seriously than they have so far.
""It would be unlikely in my mind, given what we know about coronaviruses, to have animal exposure be the principal cause of such a number of human infections."" 
Understanding how a novel virus is spreading is a crucial part of assessing its threat. 
What is this virus?
Viral samples have been taken from patients and analysed in the laboratory.
And officials in China and the World Health Organization have concluded the infection is a coronavirus.
Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people. 
At the mild end they cause the common cold, but severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) is a coronavirus that killed 774 of the 8,098 people infected in an outbreak that started in China in 2002.
Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. 
The virus has caused pneumonia in some patients and been fatal in two of them.
What do other experts say?
Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome medical research charity, said: ""There is more to come from this epidemic.
""Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it's clear that there is some level of person-to-person transmission. 
""We are starting to hear of more cases in China and other countries and it is likely, as this modelling shows, that there will be many more cases, in a number of countries.""
Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, said: ""What's really important is until there has been widespread laboratory testing it is very difficult to put a real number on the cases out there. 
""But this is a figure we should take seriously until we know otherwise, 41 animal-to-human 'spillovers' is stretching it a bit and there probably is more underlying infection than has been detected so far.""

> Health authorities are keen to avoid a repeat of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, another coronavirus that started in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800 people.

> Doctors began seeing a new type of viral pneumonia - fever, cough, difficulty breathing - in people who worked at or visited a food market in the suburbs of Wuhan late last month.

The 2019 – 2020 China pneumonia outbreak, also known as Wuhan pneumonia (Chinese: 武漢肺炎; pinyin: Wǔhàn fèiyán) began in mid-December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in central China, as an emerging cluster of people with pneumonia of unknown cause, linked primarily to stallholders who worked at the Huanan Seafood Market (華南海鮮市場), which sold live animals. Chinese scientists subsequently isolated a new coronavirus, the 2019-nCoV, which has been found to be at least 70% similar in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV, and later mapped and made available its gene sequence.The first suspected cases were reported on 31 December 2019, with the first symptoms appearing just over three weeks earlier on 8 December 2019. The market was closed off on 1 January 2020, those affected were isolated, and over 700 close contacts, including more than 400 healthcare workers were subsequently monitored. With the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, the presence of 2019-nCoV was then confirmed in 41 people in the Wuhan cluster, of which two were later reported to be a married couple, one of whom had not been to the market, and another three who were members of the same family that worked at the market's seafood stalls.

**Summary**

We estimate that a total of 1,723 cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (95% CI: 427 – 4,471) had onset of symptoms by 12th January 2020 (the last reported onset date of any case).

This estimate is based on the following assumptions:

* Wuhan International Airport has a catchment population of 19 million individuals \[1\].
* There is a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection, comprising a 5-6 day incubation period \[8,9\]  and a 4-5 day delay from symptom onset to detection/hospitalisation of a case (the cases detected in Thailand and Japan were hospitalised 3 and 7 days after onset, respectively) \[4,10\].
* Total volume of international travel from Wuhan over the last two months has been 3,301 passengers per day. This estimate is derived from the 3,418 foreign passengers per day in the top 20 country destinations based on 2018 IATA data \[11\], and uses 2016 IATA data held by Imperial College to correct for the travel surge at Chinese New Year present in the latter data (which has not happened yet this year) and for travel to countries outside the top 20 destination list.

**Caveats**

1. We assume that outbound trip durations are long enough that an infected Wuhan resident travelling internationally will develop symptoms and be detected overseas, rather than being detected after returning to Wuhan. We also do not account for the fact that international visitors to Wuhan (such as the case who was detected in Japan) might be expected to have a shorter duration of exposure and thus a lower infection risk than residents. Accounting for either factor correctly requires additional data but would increase our estimate of the total number of cases.
2. We estimate the potential number of symptomatic cases with disease severity of a level requiring hospitalisation (both the cases detected in Thailand and Japan were moderately severe). Our estimates do not include cases with mild or no symptoms.
3. The incubation period of 2019-nCov is not known and has been approximated with the estimates obtained for MERS-CoV and SARS \[8,9\].
4. We assume that international travel is independent of the risk of exposure to 2019n-CoV or of infection status. If zoonotic exposure was biased towards wealthier people, travel frequency may be correlated with exposure. Also, some travel might be causally linked to infection status (to seek healthcare overseas) or the infection status of contacts in Wuhan (this may apply to the case detected in Japan) \[10\]. Accounting for either association would increase the probability of a case travelling and therefore reduce our estimates of the total number of cases."

> BEIJING - China reported four more cases of pneumonia believed to be caused by a new coronavirus strain, causing rising concern globally that a disease health officials do not yet fully understand could spread during a key holiday period.

> Though experts say the new virus does not appear to be as lethal as SARS, there is little known about its origins and how easily it can spread. Thailand and Japan have confirmed new cases of the virus earlier this week, stoking worries globally as many of the 1.4 billion Chinese people will travel abroad during the Lunar New Year holidays that begin next week.

> The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said on Saturday the four new individuals diagnosed with the new virus are in stable condition, adding it has confirmed 45 cases in the city as of Thursday.
