The striker, who was loaned to his favourite boyhood club on Deadline Day, sat down with Sky Sports' Patrick Davison ahead of the Manchester derby to reveal all about his childhood watching United.

 ""I know many footballers say that, when they sign for a team, this is my dream team. Respect to that but my own case was different.

""Anyone who knows me back from when I was young knows me and my siblings supported Man United, we would pay to go and watch Man United play. In Nigeria, you have to have sports channels to watch that but not everyone can afford it. My parents couldn't afford that so you have to pay a viewing centre to watch that. We would pay to watch that.

""I grew up in Ajegunle, which is like a ghetto and it was very difficult there. When it would get to the weekend, everybody was excited because they wanted to watch Man United play.

""You start saving the money they would give you to go to school. You would eat at home and they would give you some pocket money to go to school and maybe eat lunch there. But you would be saving it bit by bit and when you get to the weekend, everybody is ready.

""You have your jersey and you wash it before the weekend. You put them on and go to the viewing centre and it's crazy there. Some other fans want Man United to lose then you're a Man United fan and you want them to win and you start arguing, shouting, screaming and all of that.

""In some there are 200 people in this small room. You go to another one and you see 500 people in there. Some people would stand, you're paying but even then, you're standing and watching it from afar. There's a big screen and a little screen and you have to watch there


""Back then, they also had an association of Man United fans so there would be a meeting once a week to talk about Man United, like a little fan forum. When I remember all that now, I laugh and say 'wow, from Ajegunle to the Theatre of Dreams'. It's a great moment for me and I'm enjoying every bit of it.

""It is the happiest moment of my life, playing for my dream team, the team I supported when I was young

Rumours of Ighalo's loan move to United began on the morning of January 31 - Deadline Day in Europe - but then playing for Shanghai Shenhua in China, it was late in the evening for the 30-year-old.

Explaining how the move unfolded, he said: ""I was in my hotel room in Shanghai where we were doing pressers and training. Two days before that, I heard some news about Man United and [my agent] called me about it, but I was thinking 'Man United? I'm in China' and with the coronavirus and everything, how is it even possible with two days until the end of the transfer window.


""People started calling me back in Nigeria asking what was going on and I said 'I don't want to go crazy about this but if it is God's will, it's going to happen.' So one of my brothers said 'it's going to happen, just believe' and I said 'I believe but I don't want to get too carried away so if it didn't happen, I would get disappointed'.

""I was praying about it but didn't want to show my emotions and just kept calm. Every time I would text my agent 'have you heard from them?' and there was nothing. On the last day of the transfer window, I called my agent and he said he hadn't heard anything.

""Then in the evening, I texted him and he said Man United were looking at other strikers, your name is still among them but they have not given me anything concrete and I lost hope. I said 'this isn't going to happen' because the last text I had from my agent was 8pm or 9pm in the evening Shanghai time so I went to sleep.

""Then my phone rang and my agent said 'it looks like Man United are coming for you, where are you now?' and I said 'I'm in my bed, I'm sleeping' because this is about 11pm there. He said 'where is the director [of Shanghai Shenhua]?' and he was in his room.

""I was already in bed so I got up, tied my towel around my waist and firstly, I went to the translator's room because the director doesn't speak English. I said 'Man United want to speak to [the director], we have to go'. We banged on his door and we started calling him, I think his phone was busy and I was going mad.


""I was telling my agent I was going to say yes, say that we want to discuss with [United] and the director what is going on. Then [the director] picked up his phone and we connected them with my agent, who was talking with Man United and the people in Shanghai.

""I didn't sleep until 6am in the morning because of everything, from paperwork to trying to exchange that to trying to agree the fee. Even my agent was shaking because this is very big for Man United, with all that is going on, they have the trust to bring you in. I said 'now you have to make this happen, I don't care what it has to take, just make it happen, I want to sign'.

""So it was back and forth with the people working on it and they sent the document I had to sign. Even my contract with Shanghai, I hadn't signed it yet, but I didn't care, I just wanted to sign the one with Man United and everything will be OK.

When I signed that and my agent said he had received everything OK, I was shaking on my bed, like 'is this really happening?'. It was a big dream that was finally coming to pass. I didn't believe my eyes until I landed in the UK, then it was real.

""I don't know how to explain it. You dream about it, you watch it, you see these things on TV and now, you're doing it. It's crazy, it's great, I'm happy and I want to keep going because this isn't finished.

""Firstly, I achieved this dream of playing for Man United and scoring for them but now there's even bigger work to work hard, to finish well this season and make sure this team finishes where they're supposed to be and win trophies hopefully.""


In the short term, the next test is facing Manchester City - live on Sky Sports - which will be Ighalo's first taste of the Manchester derby as a player.

Speaking about the game, he said: ""It's a big one. I'm looking forward to it and it's going to be a tough one but with these fans here, they can cheer you on to victory and I believe on Sunday, we can get it.""

But there is also the question of Ighalo's future at Man United. As it stands, he is on a loan deal until the end of the season, but could he extend this to become a permanent member of the team he supported as a child?

""For now, I'm enjoying my time, I'm living my dream and I'm working hard,"" Ighalo said. ""It's too early to talk about the future, now is for me to fight in every game, make sure I give my blood and sweat for the team, try to win games and make sure we end the season well.

""After this season, we'll see what's going on. For now, I want to keep working day-by-day, game-to-game, improving and working with these great lads in this team and this great coach who had the confidence to bring me here.


""I have to make sure I pay him back with goals, hopefully with trophies, winning games, fighting for the team, fighting for the badge and after this season, we talk about the next stage."""

PM called it a pandemic last week, to the criticism of some people, saying he had jumped the gun.

Planning for [at least](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fdbvp1/australia_person_to_person_transmission_in/) 25% to be infected in first wave.

Contact tracing and testing everyone - my state of 2mn people has already tested more people than NY city (sorry to kick when down).

3 fever clinics open in Perth on Tuesday, despite that we're yet to find community transmission (but will this week, I'm sure).

---

We have many things flawed in our govt, but for our preparedness here (it will still not be enough), I really feel we can thank the Westminster system and our hard working public servants.

Here, when the head of govt change, the machinations beneath still keep on ticking over in an apolitical manner, only with new directions. They try to provide what we need, with some degree of autonomy.

It's partly why our govt is acting confidently here, on the world stage, they believe we can come off looking at least okay. Which is really reassuring as a citizen, and will shore up votes like nothing before.

Honestly, I really am thankful."

Respiratory illness such as COVID-19 makes it difficult to oxygenate blood together with the heart efficiently, and heart conditions are a documented, potentially serious co-morbid condition (meaning they exist simultaneously) with COVID-19. I don’t mean to scare you and I hope you critically evaluate whatever you read and perhaps you should even speak with your family physician on the phone and see what they have to say as I am not a doctor. However, I would exercise caution with your father and focus on keeping yourself healthy as well so you don’t infect others. 

Take care and I wish health and safety for you and your family."

Factionalism has been more or less crushed by Xi Jinping's anti-corruption charge and centralization since 2013. 

By ""Shanghai faction"" you probably mean the allies and support that came out of former leader Jiang Zemin's time as party secretary in Shanghai. Likewise crushed. There is no ""Beijing faction"" specifically; ""draconian laws and nationalist rewrites of history"" are features of the system, not of any particular faction.

The last factional struggle was between Xi and Bo Xilai, and also between Xi and Zhou Yongkang. Both were taken down and their ""clique"" was imprisoned for corruption too. As of now, there is no apparent potential for ousting or limiting Xi's power, so even though his image and popularity have taken a hit since changing the constitution, failing to deal with Hong Kong effectively (and consequently contributing to Tsai Ying-wen's re-election victory), and his mixed record on the current coronavirus crisis, nobody is seriously considering this imperils his or the CCP's rule."

According to the genetic sequencing done by Trevor Bedford, it appears that all the coronaviruses investigated so far has come from a single source and multiplied exponentially.  

So at Time zero (T0) we had one person. Time one (T1) had two people.  T2=4 people, and T3=8 people.  Right now, we're seeing around T8=256 people to T10=1024 people.  So back when the flu you describe was going around, there were probably only 8-32 people actually infected with the coronavirus in the Puget Sound region.  That's one of the weird things with exponential growth.  It starts off really small, but can get big really fast.

I don't know if that's a comfort to you or not, but it's probably not coronavirus."

The arrival and departure from these territories is allowed only for serious and “demonstrated” reasons either work or family related. It’s garanteed the possibility to return home [for those living in the zone that are currently outside of it]. Those who are under [domiciliary] quarantine will not have any possibility to move. The President of the Council said that the provinces affected are: Parma, Piacenza, Rimini, Reggio-Emilia, Modena, Pesaro e Urbino, Venice, Padova, Treviso, Alessandria, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, Novara, Vercelli and Asti. In total, these measures will affect more than one fourth of the entire italian population.

In the decree – which confirms the anticipations given by the Corriere della Sera Saturday evening – is established a “security zone” where extremely harsh limitations are imposed. In particular: The closure of all schools of every order and rank, the suspension of all public events and skiing activitis. The closure of all museums, gyms, pools, theaters, social and cultural centers. All publci [hiring] competitons will be suspended with the exclusions of the ones for healthcare workers and the telematic ones. Bars and restourants will be opened only between 6am and 6pm, and they’ll have to maintain the required distance of one meter [between costumers] otherwise their activity will be suspended.

In the decree is written to “Absolutely avoid every movement inside the territories [of the security zone] with the exception of mevement motivated by work necessities or emergency situations”. To those who show “symptoms of respiratory infection and fever of temperature over 37,5°C” is “strongly” advised to stay at home and call their family medic, immediatly limiting all social contacts. The ordinary leaves given to healthcare and technical workers are suspended, as well as the leaves given to “the personell whose activity is necessary to mange the requests of the emergency units established on a regional level”.

The decree also says that the commercial activities will have to maintain the required distance of one meter between costumers otherwise they will be sanctioned: if due to structural reasons they can not allow such distance they will be forced to close. In the festive and pre-festive days the middle and large sized commercial facilities will be closed, as well as the ones inside malls and markets. It’s also recommended to apply quotas for entering stores, markets, fairs in order to avoid “gatherings of people”.

The access of parents and visitors to hospitals, hospices, emergency rooms and retirement homes is “Limited to only the cases allowed by the healthcare management of the structure”, which “has the duty to adopt the necessary measures to avoid possible infections”. Work meetings will have to be postponed and smart working will have to be encouraged. Places of worship will stay open, as long as they are able to garantee that there are no “Gatherings of people”.

For what concerns sport, the events and competitions of every discipline and order will be “suspended”, “in both public and private locations”. But in the decree it’s also said that “it’s still allowed for said events and competitions, and the training of agonist athletes, to take place so long as the sports facilities are used behind closed doors.” More restrctions will also be imposed in all of Italy. All meetings and spectacles will be suspended, from cinemas to museums to sport activities; as well as pub, discos, bingo halls, arcades, and the lessons of schools and universities. Store will be allowed to saty open in the workdays, bars and restourants only if the have table service and garantee the security ditance of one meter between costumers.

Once the infection was localized to Hubei, other provinces could then send their excess personnel to the hot zone as ordered by the government.  This allows maximum focus at the point of greatest necessity.

Public health response in the US, by contrast, is not something that the national government can just decide.  They can only pump funds into state and municipal governments and trust them to use the resources as they see fit.  Of course, this also means a tendency for local governments to hoard resources against each other.  Especially now that containment has failed and every state is staring down their own outbreaks, no one is going to volunteer their resources for someone else.

* First, if an employee is required to self-isolate for public health reasons —i.e. they've been told to by a doctor or by NHS 111, etc— then the employer should pay SSP for the whole period (i.e. from day 1).
* Second, if an employer wants an employee (who is not required to self-isolate for public health reasons) to self-isolate (regardless of whether that includes working from home) then the employer should be paying the employee their usual salary.

There's also some other things to consider:

* Employers often retain the contractual ability to dictate when their employees take their holidays. So, it might be possible for your friend to require the returning employee to take another two weeks holiday. (Edit:) The statutory requirement to do this is requires giving notice of twice the length of the holiday period, i.e. 4 weeks before the mandated leave starts, so **this won't be an option open to your friend** (with thanks u/Afinkawan). (/edit) The problems with this include, that the power is often limited to already accrued holiday (your friend can't cause the employee to be owing the company holiday days as result of this); also, an employer can't dictate to an employee what they do in their holiday, so there would be nothing stopping the person taking a last minute deal on a package holiday in Italy, etc.
* If an employee has worked for a company for less than two years, they have very little protection from termination. They can be fired for any reason that isn't automatically unfair dismissal (i.e. protected characteristics, etc) or no reason at all."

Over on SC, there's has a been a few recent discussions about the Coronavirus and how it could possibly affect Wrestlemania. On the surface, it seems like it's a valid concern. I get it, schools have shut down, they've made people work from home, business have shut down temporarily, and some of the biggest ones is that some festivals and major events have been canceled in advance.

All the wrestlers, the production guys, security, etc, etc. We can all agree, it it reaches that point where they need to shut the event down, it's for the best. As the safety of all involved and attending is more important than a fake fighting show.

But that's the thing, over there, it's very clear that they don't want the show canceled for the safety of people. They want Vince to cancel Wrestlemania right now, despite there being 4 weeks basically until the event, which could see positive improvements towards the virus and see it being controlled and the number of cases dwindling down, as well as the ones they have, recovering. Why do they want it canceled? Because they don't like the WWE and because WWE isn't willing to book their brand of fake fighting to their liking. Because Roman Reigns is gonna win a fake title or because part timers are gonna be working instead of ""workrate"" geniuses like Buddy Murphy or Adam Cole, so fuck the fed, shut it down. Vince should just cater to their ever changing whims, since he won't, cancel the biggest WWE show of the year, if not the biggest wrestling show of the year. All so they aren't forced to watch 7 hours of ""shitty wrestling""

But, no see, Vince won't do that. Why? Because he's such an evil, money hungry bastard. The state of Tampa could issue a state of emergency and he'd find a way force everyone into the stadium, forcing those poor fans to be exposed to the virus. Forcing his employees to work under such conditions, like the slave driver he is.

To prove their point, I've seen this hypothetical situation, where Vince won't do the right thing, even though there's nothing right now that's forcing his hand, compared to the following.

* Continuing Over the Edge 99 after Owen's fall - Evil Vince decided that money was more important than canceling the show. It's not like there was this whole state of shock after the tragedy and that there's arguments made in continuing the show. Even those there that night said he made the right call. But nope, he should've just shut it down, but he didn't because he's such an evil bastard.

* Running shows after 9/11 - Terrorism is running wild like Hulkamania, there are threats and concerns of more attacks and bombings. Vince says ""that's good shit, brother"" to the idea of still running shows, despite these concerns. Proving all he cares about is money. Even though, the argument could be made that he and the WWE as a whole wanted to give people an escape from the tragedies and what was going on and to show that America was united and they weren't gonna live in fear.

* Holding a Chris Benoit Tribute show - I don't get this one, I guess because they knew what he had done and still had the show. I don't know the logistics of the time frames when they learned of everything, but if they did know at that time, they wouldn't have gone through with it. Also, the show was a best of show with pre taped memorial speeches. They had no RAW that night, sending fans home in the wake of what had happened. So, how does that prove he's money hungry?

Also, going back to Vince not doing what is right for the fans, in regards to their safety. Remember the night after the 2015 Rumble? There was a massive blizzard, they canceled RAW. They had Cole and JBL do stuff from Stanford and had in studio interviews with Roman/Brock about their title match at Mania. But they valued the safety of the fans, talent, etc and opted not to have a show.

On top of all that, there's a blatant ignorance regarding the fact that, Wrestlemania has attracted wrestling promotions from all over to converge on that weekend and get a piece of that Mania money. If we reach a point where Mania is canceled, everything is canceled. Even before that, we see people begging Vince to ""do the right thing"" and cancel the show, but no one is calling for Impact to pull out of the weekend or for Game Changer Wrestling to cancel their shows, just in case. No, those are fine, it's only Wrestlemania that needs to be canceled. 

And they would argue ""well, Mania brings in the most people."" I disagree, there's a large portion of those people who would also be attending the various indie shows and conventions that weekend. As well as many coming from all over purely to attend those shows, not going to Wrestlemania, but only coming for all the independent shows. 

Furthermore, why aren't we asking for any wrestling shows to be canceled? Elimination Chamber is Sunday, in Philly, where there's a confirmed case of the virus. Aren't they at risk? What about AEW shows? Those guys are traveling all over the world, we got Adam Page drinking beer from fans. Who's to say haven't contracted the virus? Even if they haven't, aren't they at risk interacting with all those people? With all the traveling and what not? 

No, it's clearly on the WWE and only Wrestlemania. Fuck the Fed, fuck Vince, fuck anyone, from the talent involved or the fans attending, even those watching at home that are excited for the show. They don't deserve to enjoy it,all because I'm a bitter smark asshole. 

It's pissing me off so much, if you are genuinely concerned about the events of Wrestlemania weekend, not just Mania, but all of it, then that's cool. I respect that, I'm open to having that discussion. I'm concerned too, because I'm really excited for the weekend myself. There's tons of wrestling happening, I'm looking forward to the indie shows, I'm really excited for Mania, it's gonna be a fun weekend. And I hope that we don't reach that point where everything is off the table.

But if you're praying that Wrestlemania and only Wrestlemania gets canceled, because you're unhappy with the product or some bullshit like that, then really all I can say is, fuck you for being a petty, selfish, and childish dick."

Australians with flu-like symptoms are being told to get tested for the novel coronavirus in an escalation of health advice that threatens to inundate the medical system.

The updated instruction from federal Health Minister Greg Hunt comes as [an 82-year-old Sydney man](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p547x9) was confirmed on Sunday as the third Australian to die with COVID-19. The number of cases nationwide stands at 77, including two Australian Defence Force members who tested positive for the virus on Sunday.

The federal government is preparing to pump more than $3 billion in stimulus funds into the economy to avoid recession.

 Federal health authorities had previously advised that only people who had travelled overseas or had contact with a suspected case of coronavirus and felt unwell should get tested.     

Globally, the virus is spreading, with Italy on Sunday locking down more than 16 million people across the Lombardy region, including in the capital, Milan. The unprecedented step follows China's quarantine of up to 60 million people in Hubei, where the number of daily infections has slowed significantly and draconian restrictions are slowly being lifted.

Mr Hunt said on Sunday that the government would rather people over-test than under-test. ""Even though it can be a little bit of a stress on the system,"" he said. ""If in doubt, get yourself tested.""

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Victorian Minister for Women Gabrielle Williams had earlier urged anyone who had a cough, runny nose or sore throat to stay home and get themselves assessed. More than 10,000 tests for the coronavirus have been administered so far. Figures from the Department of Health show up to 298,000 Australians caught the flu between January and October last year.

The Australian Medical Association has told health authorities to make the advice ""very clear as soon as possible"" as it prepares to roll out a network for GPs to consult patients online amid claims they are under-equipped for a major outbreak. As of Sunday evening, the official notice from the Health Protection Principal Committee, which advises cabinet, encouraged only close contacts or travellers from high risk zones to be tested.

AMA president Dr Tony Bartone said all medical bodies had to ""start acting as one if we're to deal with this threat"" and demanded an apology from the Victorian government after it criticised a doctor for treating patients while he was unaware he had the coronavirus. 

""The \[comments\] are a concern to the frontline medical profession, who have thought about nothing but the wellbeing of the community, putting themselves in the frontline, day after day, during this evolving crisis,"" he said.

The escalation comes as Parliament prepares to face the threat of the virus. Two Defence members tested positive on Sunday. At least one travelled on flights \[QF1509 and VA651\] from Sydney to Canberra on February 28 and MPs and staff are now having their contacts traced to see if any may have contracted the disease.

Mr Hunt said most people would ultimately know somebody affected by the virus as the government prepares for up to $1 billion in funding to treat up to 200,000 patients.

The virus has raced across Europe and the United States. Italy on Sunday implemented travel restrictions in the north in a bid to stop the number of infections climbing past 6000.

 China has seen its infection rate slow to just over 100 a day which could be the key to Australia avoiding a recession as the US looks to stop cases multiplying beyond 500 in Washington state and across the country.

Australia's government is staring down the increasing possibility of a negative quarter and will sacrifice its election promise of a surplus to pump more than $3 billion into the economy.

The measures, to be announced by Thursday, will include investment allowances for businesses and incentives to keep workers in jobs as [Labor calls for the rate of unemployment benefits](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p547xw) to be lifted and for more than 3 million casual workers to be eligible for Newstart if they are forced into quarantine.

Add to shortlist

Health authorities in Hobart on Sunday said a man infected with coronavirus ignored instructions to self-isolate because he did not want to miss his casual shifts at Hobart's Grand Chancellor Hotel.

Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter will lead a national round table in Sydney on Tuesday where measures to help the casual workforce will be discussed.

Labor's health spokesman, Chris Bowen, said Labor would vote through billions of dollars in coronavirus stimulus.

""I know as soon as the government issues a stimulus package, Anthony Albanese will have a shadow cabinet meeting and facilitate any sensible packages through,"" he said.

The authorities justify this by overloading the hospitals. Comprehensive tests are no longer possible due to the laboratory capacities. Photo: Getty Images Comprehensive tests are no longer possible due to the laboratory capacities. The corona virus is also spreading rapidly in Switzerland. The number of confirmed infections rose to over 200 on Friday. Switzerland is facing an epidemic wave, said Daniel Koch of the Federal Office of Public Health (BAG) on Friday before the media. And you will increasingly lose control over the number of people infected. Because around 80 percent of patients in whom the disease takes a mild course will hardly be tested in the future. Those who have symptoms of flu or a cold, including cough or fever, should no longer report to the hospitals, but should stay at home, said Koch, head of the communicable diseases department at the BAG. Health ministers Alain Berset and Koch appealed to the population not to storm the emergency department at the weekend if there were mild symptoms of illness. ""Because of the increasing number of cases, healthcare facilities are under great pressure,"" said Berset. The goal must now be to keep the hospital capacities free for people with severe illness. According to Koch, there are currently corona patients in the hospitals who have been hospitalized for isolation but do not need hospital care. For reasons of capacity, the hospitals could no longer accept such patients. Laboratories are busy The change in practice relieves the hospitals, but means that Switzerland is increasingly losing control over the spread of the disease. Because patients who stay at home with flu-like symptoms are usually no longer tested for the coronavirus. Comprehensive tests are not possible due to the laboratory capacities. Even those who return from a risk area in Italy and then only show mild symptoms should stay at home without getting tested. However, if corona patients with a mild course are no longer identified as such, relatives are at risk of becoming infected. ""Most of the transmissions are already taking place at home,"" says Koch. However, not everyone who had contact with corona patients was infected. Nevertheless, the risk that relatives of the sick spread the virus when they go to work increases. According to Koch, they should do this as long as they do not show any symptoms of illness. The risk of infection is relatively small in these cases..."""

The more serious the health risk, the more likely the person would be tested, so the number of deaths is likely much more accurate than the number of cases.  But in a fluke, we have a nicely closed set of data where 3711 passengers and crew have been quarantined and observed.

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond\_Princess\_(ship)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Princess_(ship))

&#x200B;

On the Diamond Princess as of February 18th there were 542 infected, and by March 5th it was up to 696, with 7 deaths so far.  So, in a closed setting, with mostly old people who are at higher risk, where we know for sure that EVERYONE was tested... the death rate was about 1.3% at worst (using February 18th infected numbers).  If no one else dies, the death rate would stand at almost exactly 1%.  Obviously this is a small sample size, with some weird correlations to consider (older people, but also not in very poor health people), but it's a little piece of optimism to consider in the waves and waves of bad news."

>Public health officials and experts also struggled to find an uneasy equilibrium **between doing their jobs honestly and transparently while trying to manage a mercurial president**, who griped about what he viewed as overheated rhetoric by officials and the media.

There were about 80 people there. Maybe ten caucused for Bernie. The rest were divided between Warren and Biden. The workers who voted for Bernie couldn't make it to the caucus, of course.

Been slowly acquiring a household stock of items since early February.

Bought my first gun.

Other than doing early morning runs to grocery store, we haven't been anywhere other than work and school.

Broke the news to my daughter tonight that she can't go on her field trip to a hands on museum next week. She was ok about it, in case you are wondering.

Get depressed any time I read the news or browse on social media and see people joking about coronavirus or downplaying the seriousness of the issue.

Talked to my grandmother tonight. I warned her a few weeks ago after it broke out in Italy and iran. She is taking it seriously. That made me feel better.

Aunt with emphysema just got out of the hospital for pneumonia. She now has a fever and is struggling to breath again, may need to be admitted again.

I think I just have a blanket of sad wrapped around me. A lot of people have been sick and died, but many many more are going to get sick and die. Its just sad to know that even if you don't get it, you will most likely know someone who does, and probably someone who will die from it.

I think about the global suffering. The fear of not being able to be seen by a hospital. The mental and physical trauma healthcare workers are going to go through trying to save lives and putting theirs on the line. I think about families devastated at the loss of loved ones. 

It's just sad.

Definition of ""airborne"":

""An airborne disease is any disease that is caused by pathogens that can be transmitted through the air by both small, dry particles, and as larger liquid droplets.""

Both CDC and John Hopkins list it as possibly airborne (virus can spread from coughs/sneezes).

* Despite incidences in almost every country, no warm region had widespread community spread of the Virus. This could indicate that as the weather warms up, the epidemics in Europe / Iran / Wuhan will end. (see [cases by country](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/))

* There are reasons to believe that the death rate is exaggerated, and are more of a sign of low diagnostic rate. Germany for example has 847 diagnosed cases, with 0 deaths. Statistically, this would indicate that it's highly unlikely that the death rate is significantly higher than Flu.

But experts warn that while masks may look the same, the quality can vary wildly.

A recent test conducted by The Sunday Times showed that some are, in fact, made of poor quality materials and may just be giving users a false sense of security.

Mr Winthrop Wong, director of Wellchem Pharmaceuticals, whose surgical masks are used by hospitals here, said that masks that go into Singapore's national stockpile would need to meet American and/or European standards in terms of breathability, bacteria-filtration efficacy, water-resistance, absorbency and non-flammability.

With Mr Wong's help, The Sunday Times conducted simple tests on six brands of masks available on the market here.

They are:

1. Ultraguard from Wellchem Pharmaceuticals: These are distributed from the national stockpile to hospitals.

2. Golden Gloves: A box of 50 was bought for $9..90 from ABC Bargain Centre at Bedok.

3. Sensi Mask: A box of 50 was bought for $10 from a street peddler in Jakarta, Indonesia.

4. No brand: A box of 50 mask was bought from a local medical supplier for $20.

5. No brand: A local taxi company distributed these blue masks to its drivers.

6. No brand: A local taxi company distributed these white masks to its drivers.

For a surgical mask to work, the outer-most layer should be water-resistant, and the middle layer, which is used to trap bacteria, should not be too porous.

The innermost layer has to be able to absorb moisture such as saliva, mucus and sneeze droplets.


An absorbency test found that five of the six masks could not absorb any moisture. That means if the user sneezes, the mask will not be able to contain the droplets, which will remain smeared on the wearer's face. Absorbency is also an important factor for comfort, allowing the user to wear it for longer hours.

The only mask that passed the absorbency test is the one from the national stockpile.

When Mr Wong cut up the masks to examine the middle layer, he found at least two masks which looked porous, and one with an extremely thin filtration layer. A very thin layer would not be able to effectively trap bacteria and particles, he said.

""The whole idea of wearing a mask is to protect the people around you, not mainly to protect yourself. That's why our government says wear a mask if you are sick. So any germs can be caught inside the mask and you can throw the mask away,"" said Mr Wong.

For the flammability test, the white mask that was given to taxi drivers by a taxi company caught fire.

The outer layers of all six masks passed the water-resistance test. This is to help prevent contaminated droplets from others from being inhaled."

My own doctor of 20 years is acting like this is a nothing burger. I was talking to my doctor about this for like 15 minutes on the phone tonight asking him about the Coronavirus. I am lucky he is good like that. He does take time to talk to his patients. He said to me ""frankly, we are all going to have the Coronavirus soon"". When he said that he had no emotion in his voice and he sounded bored talking about it. He said it will be mild for most of the people catching it. He said if people are unhealthy or older they will be the ones having the most problems. I was assured it is basically nothing to worry about. I was scared and he kept reassuring me I would be fine. Maybe he was blowing smoke up my ass.

What he did say is the hospital on Long Island (NY) he works at is insanely crazy right now. He said it was getting really busy there with people panicking over flu-like symptoms. He admitted to me that in another 2-3 weeks the shit is really going to hit the fan at most of the hospitals across the USA because of all this panicking and people worrying they are infected. He also said that once they test for the Coronavirus, it is usually way too late because the person already had it for some time. He said being tested for it and finding out you are positive does nothing for you health wise as there is no cure for it. He said by the time you end up finally getting tested, you already infected a shit load of people. He explained that testing really does not get done unless the doctors deem it is absolutely necessary for older people and people that have pre-existing health issues. He said most won't do the test unless the patient is showing severe complications. What I took from that is relatively younger or normal healthy people showing symptoms won't be bothered to be tested.

He did not seem alarmed or worried at all. He gave me no major advice except wash your hands, try to stay away from crowds and not to panic because the symptoms most likely will feel like a mild flu. He didn't even sound like he thought testing was important because ""we are all going to get it"" apparently. I actually think he was way too non-nonchalant about the whole thing. Maybe he is just burnt out from working long shifts at the hospital. Maybe he was just trying to keep me calmed down. Maybe he's right and I am just being a worrywart over nothing. Who knows?"

I remember seeing a video about an elderly married couple who were only able to see each other through his window at the nursing home because of the concern for coronavirus. I’m not saying they shouldn’t limit visits, but.... man.... also.... I’ve volunteered at a nursing home and I know for a fact that residents are treated far better when family is visiting them regularly. Unfortunately, I can’t even necessarily blame the low level nursing home staff because it’s not their fault they’re understaffed, but ultimately, if they have to make a choice between doing x (bathing, changing, turning etc) a fully alert and interactive patient whose family will likely visit soon versus a confused resident whose family hasn’t shown up in years, they’re going to focus their efforts on the former...

Per chi è malato o in quarantena:

* **Stare a casa**;
* **Evitare gli altri** e se possibile usare un bagno privato;
* **Chiamare prima di visitare il medico**;
* **Indossare una mascherina** in casa e dal medico (se non è possibile, le altre persone in casa dovrebbero indossarne una in momenti di contatto)
* **Coprire tosse e starnuti**, in un fazzoletto da gettare immediatamente, o, in assenza, sulla manica - lavarsi le mani dopo ogni colpo di tosse o starnuto;
* **Lavarsi le mani per almeno 20 secondi frequentemente**. Non toccarsi naso, bocca, occhi con le mani non lavate.
* **Non condividere oggetti casalinghi**: no a condivisione di piatti, bicchieri, tazze, stoviglie, tovaglie, asciugamani e altro. Dopo averli usati, lavaggio attento con acqua e sapone.

**'We're past the point of containment': Coronavirus fight enters new phase**

*By Laura King, Alex Wigglesworth, Andrew J. Campa, Karen Kaplan*

As a cruise ship with nearly 3,000 stranded travelers prepares to dock Monday in the Port of Oakland, top health officials warned that the country has entered a new stage in dealing with the deadly coronavirus — one in which containment is no longer possible.

“We’re past the point of containment,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration during the first two years of President Trump’s administration, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

“We have to implement broad mitigation strategies. The next two weeks are really going to change the complexion in this country. We’ll get through this, but it’s going to be a hard period. We’re looking at two months, probably, of difficulty,” Gottlieb said.

U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said that shifting to a mitigation phase means that communities will see more cases and need to start thinking about whether it makes sense to cancel large gatherings, close schools and make it more feasible for employees to work from home.

“And that’s going to be different in Seattle than what it’s going to be in Jackson, Miss.,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But communities need to have that conversation and prepare for more cases so we can prevent more deaths.”

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that people who are older or have underlying health conditions should also consider avoiding large crowds and travel.

“If you are an elderly person with an underlying condition, if you get infected, the risk of getting into trouble is considerable,” Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“So it’s our responsibility to protect the vulnerable. When I say protect, I mean right now. Not wait until things get worse. Say no large crowds, no long trips. And above all, don’t get on a cruise ship.”

The comments from current and former officials marked a big shift, acknowledging that the country is past the point of being able to contain the outbreak and needs to pivot to aggressive efforts to mitigate the virus’ spread.

Trump administration officials have previously sought to downplay the risk to Americans posed by the coronavirus outbreak.

In California, officials said the Grand Princess cruise ship would dock Monday at the Port of Oakland and outlined plans for the nearly 3,000 people aboard the ship, 1,000 of whom are from California. They stressed that no one on board would be released immediately to the general public.

Here is the state’s plan:

— Passengers who require acute medical treatment and hospitalization will be transported to healthcare facilities in California.

— If passengers do not require acute medical care following health screenings, those who are California residents will go to a federally run facility in California for testing and isolation, while non-Californians will be transported by the federal government to facilities in other states.

— The crew will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, but importantly, the ship will stay in the Port of Oakland only for the duration of disembarkment. This ship will depart Oakland as soon as possible and will remain elsewhere for the duration of the crew’s quarantine.

“The City of Oakland, Alameda County and the Port of Oakland are stepping up in a major way, and their residents deserve universal praise. They are showing the world what makes our state great — coming to the rescue of thousands of people trapped aboard this ship and helping tackle a national emergency,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement.

The Port of Oakland was chosen because it is one of a limited number of docks that can accommodate a ship the size of the Grand Princess, and because it was the easiest “to seal off, securely move passengers toward their isolation destinations and protect the safety of the public,” the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services said in a statement.

At least 21 people onboard the ship have confirmed cases of COVID-19, which is caused by the coronavirus that originated late last year in China.

    #GrandPrincess Update: The logistics plan went into further review by the state and federal authorities and the ship will not berth in Oakland on Sunday. It will now be Monday – time to be determined.
    — Princess Cruises (@PrincessCruises) March 8, 2020

Princess Cruises initially stated that the docking would begin Sunday, then pushed it back to Monday after “further review by the state and federal authorities.”

Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said some of the ship’s passengers will be sent to Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio.

“I believe the folks with symptoms are mostly staying in California,” Castro tweeted. “Check me on that but that’s my best understanding.”

The passengers on board departed for Hawaii on Feb. 21. The ship was supposed to proceed to Ensenada, but the onboard coronavirus outbreak prompted the vessel to sail to San Francisco instead. It reached the California coast Thursday, but was not able to dock.

In addition to the 21 people who have already tested positive for the virus, an unknown number of others are sick and awaiting tests.

Before the Hawaii excursion, the Grand Princess took an ill-fated cruise to Mexico. One of the passengers, a 75-year-old man from Placer County, fell ill during the trip and became the first Californian to die of COVID-19. Altogether, a dozen coronavirus cases in California have been linked to passengers on that cruise.

Passengers on the ship are eager to disembark but remain frustrated by the many unknowns that remain.

Debra Gooch Healer, a passenger from Napa, said all she knew is that she would be taken to a federal facility in California. She did not know where that will be or how long she will have to stay there.

“Any ACLU attorney out there who can tell us our rights??” she tweeted.

    We just got word we will dock in Port of Oakland tomorrow with embarkation to take a couple of days. Since we live in Calif, we will be taken to a federal facility in state to be tested. No word how long or where. Any ACLU attorney out there can tell us our rights??
    — gadgetgirl6 (@gadgetgirl6) March 8, 2020

She and others also complained that they were forced to remain in their rooms, and that food supplies had run low.

Another woman who said her parents are stuck on the ship tweeted at Newsom and Vice President Mike Pence to send the passengers more food.

“I can handle my family in quarantine,” she wrote. “I cannot handle them being denied basic necessities.”

At least 437 coronavirus cases have been confirmed across the U.S., including about 90 in California. Worldwide, more than 107,000 people have been infected and more than 3,600 have died.

Most recently, Riverside County announced its first “locally acquired” case of the virus, a person who is being treated at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage, Riverside University Health System-Public Health said in a statement. Public health officials are still investigating how the person caught the virus, and are working to contact other people who may have been exposed.

Another Riverside County resident who was evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan and then quarantined at Travis Air Force Base previously tested positive for the virus. That person is continuing to recover in a Northern California hospital and has not returned to Riverside County since leaving the cruise ship, the statement said.

So far we have 104 infected. Majority of them at the life care center in Kirkland Washington. A few popping up south of puget sound Tacoma. We are going about our lives so far but i will say Seattle is practically a ghost town. I went out to capital hill last night and nothing was really ‘exciting’ or crowded. Everyone had their own personal hand sanitizer, many of us refusing to share drinks just for a ‘taste’, we are now bumping arms instead of shaking hands. We are definitely more aware of the virus. No stores so far have hand sanitizer, my local Walgreens said they would get shipment today, I just called them. They said that the warehouse they get it from told them they have run out and it could be up to a month before they get anymore. I will add I work in the health care field. Every morning we have reports with our admins, our team of nurses in regards to current patients, a new change everyday at work so far we have a serious conversation about personal hygiene, aka washing our hands, not coming to work with the sniffles etc, we as a team are really keeping each other accountable also, we have papers plastered every where about the coronavirus, we get asked a thousand questions by our patients families. Admins have stated they will not stop visitors at this time, but told us to expect changes at anytime. We have stopped visitors one time (norovirus), and I have a feeling we may stop visitors in a week or so. Numbers of cases are doubling every day. I know it won’t be long before we are hit. At least one of us in my building. I still go about my everyday life but traffic has also subsided tremendously since amazon, Microsoft and Facebook have told their employees to work from home. My mom told me that when she goes to the casino everyone is wearing latex gloves, and of masks. I met up with my brother today who complained that he couldn’t find any toliet paper at any Costco (he went to four different cities) Thankfully, I prepped long before any cases started popping up in my state. Im not one to pray, but I suppose I can say I really hope this goes away soon or else we are really gonna have a miserable summer."

Dem det beskrives i artiklen, at de ikke tester, er en gruppe som ikke testes i noget vestligt land: ""Lige nu kan vi teste alt det, vi bliver bedt om at teste \[…\] kun de patienter, der er under mistanke for at være smittede med coronavirus, får lov til at blive testet.""  Så nej, hvis en eller anden mere eller mindre tilfældig person mener, at han/hun skal testes for coronavirus, men der ikke er nogen klar grund til at tro personen har det (symptomer og/eller personkontakter kombineret med rejsemønster), så vil man ikke få en test. Det er kun nogle enkelte steder i Asien, hvor alle kan blive testet (om det er fornuftigt i forhold til ressourcer er en anden diskussion).

Dem der skal testes, kan stadig testes i DK, da der, som der netop beskrives, stadig er lagre, men de er svindene, og det kan give problemer med tiden. Hvis de opbruges og ikke kan fyldes igen, så er man nød til at skifte til en testmetode, hvor det tager længere tid at få svaret (ca. et døgn).

Det er i øvrigt et problem for alle, ikke kun DK. Det er næsten en uge siden, at WHO først sagde, at der var tegn på verdensomspændende mangel af visse produkter. WHO foreslog, at produktionen blev sat op, og det blev estimeret, at +40% i var nødvendigt. Problemet er bare, at en stor del af verdens forsyning af en række medicinske produkter kommer fra Kina, og hele deres produktion er allerede nede i gear i forhold til normalen, samtidig med at alle lande vil have mere.

Hvis (eller når) der kommer et rigtigt stort udbrud i DK, vil vi sikkert også se det samme, som man har set i en nogle lande (Kina, Italien) med store udbrud: Man tester nogle, mens andre ud fra deres symptomer formodes at have sygdommen og behandles derefter. På nuværende tidspunkt er den eneste behandling man har til alvorlige tilfælde alligevel symptombehandling (f.eks. ilt/respirator), da ingen medicin er bevist effektiv til at bekæmpe denne virus."

Sorry but this is simply not true.

This is quite a vague statement, as the numbers differ quite a bit per country. The percentage of people who got infected *while being in the Netherlands* lies around 25%, and mind you this is a total, not the daily growth percentage. It could be debated if those who got affected abroad should be counted as growth developed in the Netherlands. Also, they are testing more people than they were before, so you ought to get an greater increase in numbers during the earlier stages. You can't compare the daily percentage growth in a group of less than 200 people (The Netherlands, numbers as of 07/03) to growth in a group of over 5000 (Iran, Italy and South Korea) that have been dealing with infections over a longer period of time.

Here’s what coronavirus does to the body
From blood storms to honeycomb lungs, here’s an organ-by-organ look at how COVID-19 harms humans.
11 MINUTE READ
BY AMY MCKEEVER

PUBLISHED FEBRUARY 18, 2020

MUCH REMAINS UNKNOWN about the novel coronavirus ripping through China, but one thing is certain. The disease can cast a storm over the whole human body.

Such has been the nature of past zoonotic coronaviruses, ones that hopped from animals to humans like SARS and MERS. Unlike their common-cold-causing cousins, these emergent coronaviruses can spark a viral-induced fire throughout many of a person’s organs, and the new disease—dubbed ""COVID-19"" by the World Health Organization—is no exception when it is severe.

That helps explain why the COVID-19 epidemic has killed more than 1,800 people, surpassing the SARS death toll in a matter of weeks. While the death rate for COVID-19 appears to be a fifth of SARS, the novel coronavirus has spread faster.
Confirmed cases rose to more than 60,000 last Thursday, nearly a 50 percent jump relative to the prior day, and the tally has since increased by another 13,000. This leap reflects a change in the way Chinese authorities are diagnosing infections instead of a massive shift in the scope of the outbreak. Rather than wait for patients to test positive for the virus, diagnoses now include anyone whose chest scan reveals COVID-19’s distinctive pattern of pneumonia. This method will hopefully allow authorities to isolate and treat patients more quickly.

If this outbreak continues to spread, there’s no telling how harmful it could become. A leading epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong warned this week that COVID-19 could infect 60 percent of the globe if left unchecked.

On Monday, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention released clinical details on the first 72,314 patients diagnosed through February 11. The report shows that COVID-19 killed 2.3 percent of patients, meaning it is currently 23 times more fatal than the seasonal flu. Severe disease and deaths were reported in every age group, except kids under nine years old.

Meanwhile, countries have been scrambling to evacuate their citizens from a cruise ship that’s been quarantined off the coast of Japan. The Japanese health ministry announced Tuesday that an additional 88 passengers on the ship were diagnosed with COVID-19—bringing the total to 542. Of the more than 300 Americans who have been repatriated from the ship, 14 have tested positive for the coronavirus.

But what actually happens to your body when it is infected by the coronavirus? The new strain is so genetically similar to SARS that it has inherited the title SARS-CoV-2. So combining early research on the new outbreak with past lessons from SARS and MERS can provide an answer.


The Lungs: Ground zero
For most patients, COVID-19 begins and ends in their lungs, because like the flu, coronaviruses are respiratory diseases.

They spread typically when an infected person coughs or sneezes, spraying droplets that can transmit the virus to anyone in close contact. Coronaviruses also cause flu-like symptoms: Patients might start out with a fever and cough that progresses to pneumonia or worse. (Find out how coronavirus spreads on a plane—and the safest place to sit).

After the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization reported that the disease typically attacked the lungs in three phases: viral replication, immune hyper-reactivity, and pulmonary destruction.

Not all patients went through all three phases—in fact only 25 percent of SARS patients suffered respiratory failure, the defining signature of severe cases. Likewise, COVID-19, according to early data, causes milder symptoms in about 82 percent of cases, while the remainder are severe or critical.

Look deeper, and the novel coronavirus appears to follow other patterns of SARS, says University of Maryland School of Medicine associate professor Matthew B. Frieman, who studies highly pathogenic coronaviruses.

In the early days of an infection, the novel coronavirus rapidly invades human lung cells. Those lung cells come in two classes: ones that make mucus and ones with hair-like batons called cilia.

Mucus, though gross when outside the body, helps protect lung tissue from pathogens and make sure your breathing organ doesn’t dry out. The cilia cells beat around the mucus, clearing out debris like pollen or viruses.

Frieman explains that SARS loved to infect and kill cilia cells, which then sloughed off and filled patients’ airways with debris and fluids, and he hypothesizes that the same is happening with the novel coronavirus. That’s because the earliest studies on COVID-19 have shown that many patients develop pneumonia in both lungs, accompanied by symptoms like shortness of breath.

That’s when phase two and the immune system kicks in. Aroused by the presence of a viral invader, our bodies step up to fight the disease by flooding the lungs with immune cells to clear away the damage and repair the lung tissue.

When working properly, this inflammatory process is tightly regulated and confined only to infected areas. But sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way, including your healthy tissue.

“So you get more damage instead of less from the immune response,” Frieman says. Even more debris clogs up the lungs, and pneumonia worsens. (Find out how the novel coronavirus compares to flu, Ebola, and other major outbreaks).

During the third phase, lung damage continues to build—which can result in respiratory failure. Even if death doesn’t occur, some patients survive with permanent lung damage. According to the WHO, SARS punched holes in the lungs, giving them “a honeycomb-like appearance”—and these lesions are present in those afflicted by novel coronavirus, too.

LUNGS 101
The lungs replenish the body with life-giving oxygen. Learn about the anatomy of the lungs, how the organs make respiration possible, and how they are vulnerable to illnesses.

These holes are likely created by the immune system’s hyperactive response, which creates scars that both protect and stiffen the lungs.

When that occurs, patients often have to be put on ventilators to assist their breathing. Meanwhile, inflammation also makes the membranes between the air sacs and blood vessels more permeable, which can fill the lungs with fluid and affect their ability to oxygenate blood.

“In severe cases, you basically flood your lungs and you can’t breathe,” Frieman says. “That’s how people are dying.”

The Stomach: A shared gateway
During the SARS and MERS outbreaks, nearly a quarter of patients had diarrhea—a much more significant feature of those zoonotic coronaviruses. But Frieman says it’s still not clear whether gastrointestinal symptoms play a major part in the latest outbreak, given cases diarrhea and abdominal pain have been rare. But why does a respiratory virus bother the gut at all?

When any virus enters your body, it looks for human cells with its favorite doorways—proteins on the outside of the cells called receptors. If the virus finds a compatible receptor on a cell, it can invade.

Some viruses are picky about which door they choose, but others are a little more promiscuous. “They can very easily penetrate into all types of cells,” says Anna Suk-Fong Lok, assistant dean for clinical research at the University of Michigan Medical School and former president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.


Both SARS and MERS viruses can access the cells that line your intestines and large and small colon, and those infections appear to flourish in the gut, potentially causing the damage or the leakage of fluid that becomes diarrhea.

But Frieman says we don’t know yet if the novel coronavirus does the same. Researchers believe COVID-19 uses the same receptor as SARS, and this doorway can be found in your lungs and small intestines.

Two studies—one in the New England Journal of Medicine and one preprint in medRxiv involving 1,099 cases—have also detected the virus in stool samples, which might indicate the virus could spread via feces. But this is far from conclusive.

“Whether that kind of fecal transmission is occuring for this Wuhan virus, we don’t know at all,” Frieman says. “But it definitely looks like it’s there in the stool and it looks like people do have GI symptoms associated with this.”

Blood storm
Coronaviruses can also cause problems in other systems of the body, due to the hyperactive immune response we mentioned earlier.

A 2014 study showed that 92 percent of patients with MERS had at least one manifestation of the coronavirus outside of the lungs. In fact, signs of a full body blitz have been witnessed with all three of the zoonotic coronaviruses: elevated liver enzymes, lower white blood cell and platelet count, and low blood pressure. In rare cases, patients have suffered from acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest.

But this isn’t necessarily a sign that the virus itself is spreading throughout the body, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and associate research scientist at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. It might be a cytokine storm.

Cytokines are proteins used by the immune system as alarm beacons—they recruit immune cells to the site of infection. The immune cells then kill off the infected tissue in a bid to save the rest of the body."

Trust me what you are doing is not ""helping"" the public... 

quite the opposite really - you are:

* fueling Hysteria, on unfound ideals (unless you are a doctor/nurse and have examined/tested them personally - you have no basis for your claims) 

* intercepting the work that public health, and the medical industry does.  

the reason this is damaging to the public is:

* further entrenches distrust in the medical community (who are seen as not doing their job) - when everyone who is known to have it, have gone through strict criteria on who they have come in contact with; joe schmoe in the public does not have it) - Already we are seeing conspiracies about Novel Coronavirus COVID-19; much of which completely unfounded.

* Makes the public more anxious about their health (when as mentioned previously) - your implications are totally baseless. 

* also shows a distrust to local government food saftey laws, as well as the managers and staff of the restaurant. 

* Contributing to the god awful reporting on this - (the media have done in my opinion the worst reporting on a disease I have ever seen - every little test has been treated as more fuel for the hysteria.

* Allowing people to be the target of bullying - there have been reports of many people who have either been confirmed (or suspected) have been the victims of targeted harassment online, and in person... publishing where people work - just puts a target on their head (especially considering Palmerston North is a small place). 

* Driving down local businesses - as your implications are completely baseless and unfounded - this further pushes people not to go to establishments that are 100% fine, in a fear. 

* Fuels race based profiling of people - especially considering all the cases confirmed in New Zealand are from Italy and Iran. - Majority of the Hysteria and targeting for bullying has boiled down to Racism, which is particularly bad given Palmerston North is currently host to the festival of cultures. 

In conclusion I know you believe you are making our community better - but your execution is the exact opposite. Its dangerous - and you really should consider taking down the post."

President Emmanuel Macron is to hold a new meeting on the issue at the Elysée today at 18h (Sunday March 8), after cases rose by 336 in just 24 hours to 949, and the death toll rose to 16.

Of these 16, 12 were people aged over 70, with comorbidities (existing health conditions). Of the 949 diagnosed, 45 are confirmed as completely cured.

Yet, director general of health Professor Jérôme Salomon said: “This is fewer [people cured] than we would see for normal ‘flu.”

The most-affected regions are Grand Est (250 cases), Hauts-de-France (173), Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (129), Ile-de-France (104), and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (102). All other regions have confirmed fewer than 50 cases each.

Professor Salomon said: “In France, we are still at stage two, with a clear objective to slow the spread of the virus in our country. We will move inevitably towards stage three gradually, and then arrive at stage four, which signals a return to normality.”"

The wedding isn’t for another week and will last three days with 200+ guests. We have two more domestic flights in India before we head home. 

We all sat down to talk about my concerns with the coronavirus (also included in the discussion were my brother and his friend, both of whom have PhDs in public health). They basically said it’s no big deal and we’ll just make sure to wash our hands and use sanitizer. If we get sick, they say we’ll contact the US Embassy which will fly us home. 

We have 30 R95 masks between us (same functionality as N95), which I brought, but nobody else will wear them and my wearing them is futile since we’re all together almost all the time, so if they get the coronavirus, I will too. And besides my primary concern is my parents’ health. 

I don’t know what to do. India only has 39 confirmed cases (but I also imagine community spread has happened and far more are undiagnosed). But two weeks ago, Italy had 7 cases and now there are over 8000 with 18,000 projected in the next two weeks. A lot can happen in two weeks.

Currently available rtPCR-based SARS-COV-2 coronavirus diagnostic tests take about 4 hours to obtain results, with throughput limited by availability of laboratory facilities and trained personnel.  To prevent the pandemic spread of the coronavirus, a faster way to detect infected patients is urgently needed.  Today, Academia Sinica (AS) proudly announced that the first group of monoclonal antibodies specifically binding the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) has been successfully generated and tested by Dr. An-Suei Yang and his team at the Genomics Research Center in AS.  If successfully manufactured and validated, the rapid immune-based test kit could detect coronavirus in only 20 minutes, just like a rapid influenza test.

His team produced N proteins from 7 different viral species and screened against these to obtain a few dozen monoclonal antibodies. Out of these few dozen, one antibody against only SARS-COV-2 N protein, 9 against only SARS-COV N protein, and 36 against both SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV N proteins were developed.  One additional advantage, said Dr. Yang, is that none of these monoclonal antibodies bind any N proteins of the other 5 strains of coronavirus, thus cross-reactivity will not be a problem for the rapid SARS-COV-2 detection kit.

With the help of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Dr. Yang’s team is working with manufacturers on the development and production of prototypes. In the coming months, they will discuss product validation and certification with the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. They will then work with the Ministry of Health and Welfare to bring a rapid coronavirus test kit to Taiwan to combat this devastating epidemic.

I couldn't find an existing coronavirus dashboard that focused on the U.S. with breakdowns at the state/county level or data personalized to your location. I believe information is king when it comes to informing our preparation so I created a site that shows the real-time number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths in your county and nationwide. If you share your location it can tell you if you are near any confirmed cases.

Personally I'm from Seattle, WA which has the highest number of cases/deaths in the nation and people are clearing out grocery stores and working from home the entire month. I found it useful to analyze the numbers with a tool instead of combing through countless news articles (which are often sensationalist) to assess how the situation is progressing in the city.

Please note the project is still very new and I am continually improving it as the days go by, but I wanted to get it into your hands early. If you have any suggestions for features or anything else, please let me know!"

What makes absolutely no sense is that this is just a temporary fix that will only push this off for, at most, a couple of weeks.  It's just so stupid.  He could've just done his job, said that the economy was great until this coronavirus showed up, and he still might've had a shot at getting re-elected.  Instead, he has inextricably tied both the economy AND the virus to his presidency.  Just claiming that the economy was completely his doing was a pretty incredibly risky and stupid thing to do, but it was on its way to being successful if it weren't for the virus.  If he handled this with any amount of forethought at all, he could have completely tied the coronavirus to the declining stock market and wiped his hands clean of the link he's made between his presidency and the stock market. It is still what he's going to try and do, but he's making it harder and harder the longer that he withholds information and allows a larger outbreak to occur throughout the United States.  This is clearly going to negatively affect the economy worse than if he had tried to address every case early-on and reduce the spread of the virus as early as possible.   I'm hoping that his supporters don't keep burying their heads in the sand once his incompetence starts killing them.  It seems that this is how people in Iran and China reacted after they found out that their leaders were lying to them.    


Now that he has manipulated the numbers, once the markets start crumbling again, it will be completely tied to him in everyone's minds.

The first confirmed case of coronavirus in the District is the rector of Christ Church Georgetown, church and city officials said Sunday.

The Rev. Timothy Cole, the church’s top-ranking clergy, tested positive on Saturday, a church official said. D.C. officials confirmed he was the same man in his 50s with no recent international travel whom they identified as the first presumptive case.

The historic Episcopal church canceled Sunday services — the first cancellation since a fire in the 19th century — and has been calling and emailing parishioners. Cole has been hospitalized since Thursday and is in stable condition, officials said.

Cole fell ill shortly after attending an episcopal conference in Louisville, Ken., on Feb 22, church spokesman Rob Volmer said. Cole’s health improved before he attended church events last weekend, and deteriorated early this week before his Thursday hospitalization.

Volmer said Cole was present for three services last Sunday attended by 550 people.

Cole did not appear to show symptoms then, had been vigilant about using hand sanitizer and washing his hands, and had spent part of his services reminding parishioners about good hygiene practices, Volmer said. His wife and son are self-quarantined at their home.

Cole told parishioners there was “no need to panic” in an email Sunday.

“First, I want to assure you that I will be okay,” Cole wrote. “I am receiving excellent care and am in good spirits under the circumstances. I will remain quarantined for the next 14 days as will the rest of my family.”

Meanwhile, Virginia announced its second presumptive case, involving a resident of Fairfax City. The person in his or her 80s “traveled on a similar Nile cruise” as other patients who have tested positive, the Virginia Department of Health said. The resident showed signs of a respiratory illness Feb. 28 and was hospitalized Thursday. The person is in stable condition.

State officials say both Virginia cases pose low risk of exposure to the general public.

The Fairfax resident had “very little exposure” to the community after returning home and had no interaction with school-age children before being hospitalized, Benjamin Schwartz, Fairfax County’s lead epidemiologist said at a Sunday afternoon news conference. His spouse is not showing symptoms of Covid-19 but is currently being tested.

The total number of cases in the Washington region has reached seven. The announcement about the Fairfax City resident came less than a day after Virginia announced its first presumptive positive patient — a U.S. Marine assigned to Fort Belvoir. The Marine had returned recently from “official business” overseas, tweeted Jonathan Rath Hoffman, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs.

The Department of Defense is leading the effort to trace his contacts, local authorities said. It is not immediately clear whether he interacted with school age children or the elderly before being hospitalized.

And organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference said a person who attended their event at Maryland’s National Harbor in late February had been infected.

On Thursday, Maryland health officials announced that three individuals in Montgomery County — a couple in their 70s and an unrelated woman in her 50s — tested positive for the virus after returning home from a cruise on the Nile. The three patients are recovering from flu-like symptoms but are in good condition.

On Saturday, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) also announced the District’s second presumptive case: a visitor who stayed in the District before testing positive for the virus in a Maryland hospital.

Bowser (D) said Saturday that Cole, whose name was not given at the time, is not believed to have traveled outside the United States or been in close contact with anyone else who is infected.

The mayor said the other person who developed symptoms of covid-19 is still hospitalized in Maryland. She did not give details of his condition. Covid-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

D.C. health department officials are conducting “contact tracing” investigations to determine with whom the two men came into contact.

“Our message to D.C. residents continues to be: Help us prevent the spread of germs and stay informed,” Bowser said at a news conference Saturday night at the Wilson Building.

She urged residents to follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to wash hands, cover coughs and stay home if sick. The mayor said she has no plans to cancel District-sponsored events.

“We recognize that it is fluid, and every day we will monitor the situation on the ground in the District,” Bowser said. “We put the safety of D.C. residents first.”

Jenifer Smith, director of the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences, said the city’s public lab can test 50 people a day. Testing capabilities in the District will increase when private labs receive testing kits.

The Marine who tested positive is being treated at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, Rath Hoffman said.

The Virginia Department of Health said the state government is working with officials at the hospital. It said there has been no evidence of coronavirus spreading in the state, and the risk to the general public remains low."

“If you are an elderly person with an underlying condition, if you get infected, the risk of getting into trouble is considerable. So it's our responsibility to protect the vulnerable,” he said.

Because of the Coronavirus, the price of oil has dropped significantly, so they wanted to cut production to keep it from falling.

So Saudi Arabia is going to open the taps, flood the market with discounted oil, and drive the price way down to punish Russia economically.

More than 40 Minnesotans remain on the ship, state Department of Health officials said Saturday. The ship is in limbo off the California coast waiting to dock as 21 current passengers have tested positive for the virus.

Kris Ehresmann, director of infectious disease for the Minnesota Department of Health, said the public is not at risk from any of the Grand Princess passengers. The one passenger who became sick with the virus “did everything right” and limited exposing others to the coronavirus.

“In terms of this patient and impact on Minnesota, we only have positive things to say,” Ehresmann said. “From an epidemiological standpoint it is about as good as you can ask for.”


The infected patient was not within six feet of anyone for more than 10 minutes, state officials said. That means there is no concern of community exposure at this time.

One health worker was exposed to the patient, but both were wearing masks.

“The facility did everything right with this patient,” Ehresmann said. “The health system handled it perfectly.”

The patient is an older person who had a mild case of the coronavirus, including fever and respiratory symptoms, Ehresmann said. They are stable and recovering at home under self-quarantine.

The other Minnesotans who disembarked from the Grand Princess on Feb. 21 in San Francisco have all tested negative for the virus. They are now past the 14-day incubation period.

The Grand Princess cruise trip apparently had two legs. The passengers who got off the boat Feb. 21 were on the first part of the trip, which visited Mexico, and about 40 other Minnesotans continued on the voyage.

“I want to be clear, those individuals are still on that ship,” Ehresmann said.

Federal officials said Saturday they hope to dock the boat at a non-commercial port somewhere in California. Passengers may be able to leave the ship but would likely be under quarantine until health officials are sure they are not infected.

The state Department of Health continued to test local patient samples for the virus Saturday but has reported just one case so far. The department gets about 90 calls per day from physicians with suspected cases from patients in their care.

Testing is currently focused on people with symptoms who were in contact with the virus, either through an infected person or by travel to an area with lots of infections. Patients hospitalized with serious respiratory infections are also considered for testing when other causes are ruled out.

Commercial testing through medical providers is expected to be available as soon as next week. Several health insurers said Friday they would cover the costs of tests deemed medically necessary.

To stop the spread of the coronavirus, health officials are reminding people to wash their hands thoroughly and often, cover coughs and sneezes and stay home if they are sick.

Should the virus begin to spread in the community, health officials will use “social distancing” to limit residents’ exposure. That could mean asking people to work from home, limiting large social gatherings and possibly closing schools.

Health officials say widespread closings will be used judiciously to limit unintended impacts on families who rely schools so they can work and on children who depend on schools meals.
COVID-19, a coronavirus first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December, continues to spread around the globe. There are now more than 105,000 cases worldwide and about 3,500 deaths.

In the U.S. 340 infected people have been identified as of Saturday morning and 16 people have died."

I don't think grades depend on luck nearly as much as you think, and this is coming from someone who's taken a ton of weedouts: bio, chem, ochem, CS, info, math, econ, you name it, that covers about everything besides physics. Yeah some of those classes had dumb grading, but I felt for all of them my grades were entirely in my hands. Bio grades seemed completely arbitrary to me, but you can still learn what they want so you can succeed in the classes.

People who get into CS also don't have to have perfect grades. I know many people who scored sub 3.5 in CSE 143 and still got into the major. Grades are important, but it's not the hyperbole that everyone always throws around where you need to be perfect. Not every single point matters and imo that's a bad mindset to have when you're trying to get into CS because it'll just stress you out and make you worse.

I don't have the stats on me so I'm not 100% sure, but someone who was just recently admitted told me about 60-70 / around 400 people just got in this last CS cycle. That's 15-17.5% if those numbers are right. Yeah not great chances and I probably wouldn't come here with those chances, but that is still something that's doable and not completely out of the question. Hell it's higher than other CoE admissions.

And lastly CSE != Software Engineering. Yeah the theory makes you more equipped to handle learning SWEing, but I met a guy the other week who studied EE and got a SWE job TC 170k. He's also not the only EE guy I know who's SWEing. I also have a friend in math doing the same.

If you want to study computer science and are dead set on it, you probably shouldn't come here. If you want to SWE, the most direct path is computer science. It's not true that you can't SWE without a CS degree though."

(The popular meme, not grammatical error) They confirmed I in fact have bronchitis but also a nodule on my lung and need to follow up with a pulmonologist to ensure it does not change (cancer concern) So you need to understand, there is a lot of fear. Asian countries are more densely populated than America. Not racist at all, just fact. We are far less likely to see the numbers the Chinese are seeing. Please calm down, wash your hands, and always check out shortness of breath because you could have cancer. Like literally it is more likely that I, a 31 year old smoker, have lung cancer than coronavirus. I guess i can thank the fear for me actually going to the hospital because i would not have otherwise since i assumed it was viral bronchitis (which is the official diagnosis) It actually might save my life since i had no symptoms of cancer.

2020-03-08,jetpatch,goodnewsforwomen,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodnewsforwomen/comments/ffagoo/women_are_generally_stronger_than_men/fjx7v6h/,"Coronavirus is killing more men than women. In its first six weeks almost equal numbers of males and females were infected with the disease, but only 1.7% of the women went on to die, compared with 2.8% of the men. Scientists think they know why: women’s immune systems are stronger than men’s. They’re built that way.

Dr Sharon Moalem, a Canadian-born physician, rare disease specialist and author, has a theory that women are genetically tougher than men. In 2016 Moalem and his wife, Anna, were driving in Toronto. A car ran through a red light and smashed into them. “We rolled,” he recalls. “The cabin, the roof, totally caved in. We were very lucky to be alive. If we hadn’t ducked down, we would probably have been decapitated.”

They were hospitalised for more than a month with very similar injuries. But here’s the strange thing: Anna was released two weeks earlier than Sharon. “What was really noticeable was the healing time,” he says. “The superficial cuts, for example — her healing time was faster. I got more infections than she did, my infections didn’t clear as fast and I just didn’t get back on my feet to the same degree.”

His delayed recovery and the resilience of his wife did not surprise him. To him it was more proof that women are genetically superior to men. After the crash, he decided to write a book about it — The Better Half: On the Genetic Superiority of Women.
The evidence is strong. Women on average live longer than men. More men are born than women — 105 to every 100 — but, by the age of 40, the numbers are equal and, by 100, 80% of the survivors are female. Women suffer fewer congenital birth abnormalities — tongue-tie, webbed toes and so on — than men. Men are about 20% more likely to get cancer and 40% more likely to die from it. Male children are twice as likely to suffer developmental disabilities such as ADHD, autism, learning problems and stammering. Women tend to have better colour vision than men and some are tetrachromatic, which means they may see up to 100 million colours, not the one million most men struggle by on.

Ah, you say, but men are physically stronger than women. Well, no, not in terms of survival. When Stalin’s policies in Soviet Ukraine starved millions, more women than men survived. Men are certainly more muscular and better than women at most sports requiring power. No female sprinter is going to beat Usain Bolt, and men still dominate at marathons. But men are not so good when it comes to extreme endurance contests such as ultramarathons.

“The further the race, the more difficult the conditions and that’s when men start dropping off,” Moalem says. The point was dramatically made last year when Jasmin Paris, a 35-year-old vet and mother, won the 268-mile Montane Spine Race along the Pennine Way up to Scotland. “She broke the course record by 12 hours. At the rest stations along the way, she was pumping breast milk for her baby while the men were flat out on the floor.”
Moalem also cites the Transcontinental cycle race, a pedal across Europe of about 2,500 miles. Last year that was also won by a woman, Fiona Kolbinger, a 24-year-old medical student from Germany. This is happening because, increasingly, women are taking part in events once thought too difficult for them.
In fact, they’re easier for women than men. Why?
“We think it is twofold,” Moalem says. “One reason is that women have a lower resting metabolic rate, so they don’t exhaust themselves as easily. The other piece of this puzzle that I looked at was famine survival, for which women have an immense advantage. I think that’s where the ultra-endurance performance comes from.”
He does not mention the rigours of pregnancy, once compared to running a marathon daily. Surely this is the ultimate proof of his theory? Moalem is too much of a scientist to go there.

“Suffice to say that a mammalian pregnancy requires a staggering biological response and adaptation. Yet until we manage to get an XY male pregnant, there’s really no way for us to make that comparison and know for certain. But I would say that far more impressive even than a genetic female’s capacity to support a pregnancy to term is their ability to make it across the supercentenarian finish line. There’s really nothing biologically harder for a human to pull off then making it to 110 years of age and beyond.”"

* 2/3rds - Ira Longini, a biostatistician and adviser to the WHO

* 60-80% - Prof Gabriel Leung, the chair of public health medicine at Hong Kong University

https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/482794-officials-say-the-cdc-is-preparing-for

At 50% of the world infected and a 2% morality rate, that's 78 million people...

And that's an average mortality rate (1.5% outside of China atm).  For 60-69 age bracket, it's 3.6%, for 70-79, it's already 8%.  And that doesn't take into account pre-existing conditions on top of that.  Cardiovascular disease, for example, adds and extra 10%+

You could have bought last year and for this to happen, it's the risk. Go back 12 months everyone people were posting the same things about Brexit. There will always be something, the world is volatile. 

- not necessarily. Half of the reason major cities are so expensive is because of foreign investment etc. and most of those elderly people probably have a family to leave their estate to, so don't expect a sudden flood of the market. That might be a first house for a grandchild now. Also spouses, it's not guaranteed both die, lots of couples still. The death rate is not significant enough to cause big ripples at this point, unless they all die within a small few miles of each other I'd imagine. 

- if people lose jobs then people can't afford to move, so you'll find some slow down also, lots of things get stuck when people can't find an onward chain

- it's generally not in a government's interest for everything to go haywire, and they are well aware a significant proportion is up to their eyeballs in debt

Overall thoughts: buying somewhere to live is not necessarily to be viewed the same way as an investment. Evaluate your life (you say 6 years but if you really had to could you do another year etc. Flexibility is important).

Unless you've got a crystal ball don't over think it. You can pay rent for another 6 years instead but on that timeframe buying usually will win out."

As of Sunday, Virginia has two test kits with the capacity to test up to 400 people — an adequate amount given the existing cases, said Dr. Denise Toney, the state’s director of lab services. More test kits are on their way, she added.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said state officials had discussed the CPAC-related infection with the CDC, the White House, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the state health agency in New Jersey, where the person was reportedly hospitalized.

Hogan (R) urged people who attended the conference in Prince George’s County to take their temperature twice a day and notify their health-care provider and local health department if that temperature exceeds 100.4 or if they develop a cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Anyone with those symptoms should remain at home until they receive instructions about next steps from their health-care provider or local health department, Hogan said in a statement.

President Trump and Vice President Pence both attended the conference. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that the White House is aware of the patient and added that “at this time there is no indication” that either Trump or Pence “met with or were in close proximity to the attendee.”

Maryland lawmakers who went to CPAC said they spent Saturday evening texting friends to check their health after learning a conference attendee had been diagnosed with coronavirus.

“None of us are sick,” said Del. Lauren R. Arikan (R-Harford). But Arikan, who is 24 weeks pregnant, said she is now second-guessing her decision to attend the event.

“I almost didn’t go because … of the virus, but I didn’t want to be one of those nutty people staying in,” she said. “I didn’t want to overreact, but now I feel like I underreacted.”

Arikan said she spent the majority of her time in the main hall. The infected person was not in that area, according to an email CPAC organizers sent to attendees.

“We were obsessively washing our hands, going to the bathroom, washing our hands,” she said, noting that attendees weren’t allowed to carry purses, so she had no hand sanitizer with her. “But now I think about it, the bathroom is where sick people are.”

Del. Matt Morgan (R-St. Mary’s) attended the conference with his wife and daughters. None are showing any symptoms, he said, and he thinks there is little chance his family was exposed.

“We were all there for a short amount of time … It wasn’t like we were shaking hands,” he said.

Del. Sid A. Saab (R-Anne Arundel) said he received the email from conference organizers on Saturday afternoon. The email said to “remain calm and to listen to health providers,” he said. “I feel fine,” Saab said, adding that he is not anxious because he has sat in on briefings with the state health department. “I’ve been washing my hands.”

Meanwhile, officials said no residents or staff members have tested positive for or exhibited symptoms of coronavirus at the Village of Rockville, a sprawling retirement community that was visited on Feb. 28 by one of the patients in Montgomery County.

How to sign up for our free coronavirus newsletter (with relaxed paywall)

Allison Combs, a spokeswoman from the Village, said the facility had been screening residents and employees for symptoms associated with coronavirus even before Hogan announced Friday night that the woman who tested positive had been there.

Staffers at the Village are working to identify the individuals who were with her at the Feb. 28 post-funeral reception for a former resident. Those individuals would then undergo more frequent screening. It is unclear how many Village residents were there.

The Maryland Department of Health has not recommended that attendees of the Feb. 28 event be quarantined, Combs said. Out of an abundance of caution, the Village — a 27-acre retirement community that houses about 300 people — has reduced visiting hours and postponed all gatherings and public events.

Hogan said attendees of the event should contact health officials and watch for symptoms.

On Friday, the grandson of the man whose funeral the patient attended called a phone number provided by the state and was told he did not need to be tested because he was not showing flu-like symptoms.

“It has made it a lot more real,” the grandson said. “Honestly, the past week or so, I grew sick of the name ‘coronavirus.’ But it has driven it a lot closer to home, knowing that the event in question was my grandfather’s shiva.”

Peggy Shelly of New York said she has not received information or been able to get in contact with her 96-year-old mother at the Village, which used to be called the National Lutheran Home and is located on Veirs Drive, about two miles west of Interstate 270.

“I’m a little bit surprised that the management at the Village haven’t reached out to us,” she said Saturday. “The only information I have is pulled from Twitter.”

Combs said they have sent out information to all family members who provided their emails to the Village."

https://diatribe.org/coronavirus-preparation-strategies-people-diabetes  

> What we know about COVID and diabetes

> Diabetes is generally known to cause an increased risk of infection. This could be due to fluctuating blood glucose levels, challenged immune systems, or a combination of the two. In the early COVID cases from China, 7.3% of the people who died also had diabetes. That’s a high percentage. Is there something that could have been done to prevent the deaths? That’s what we want to ensure for everyone learning about COVID now.

> Additional data has been released, analyzing the impact of various health conditions in a study of 1,590 patients with COVID-19 from China. After adjusting for age and smoking status, diabetes was one of the things that was associated with a greater risk of infection compared to someone without diabetes. This study is interesting because it is looking at the risk for hospitalization, need for ventilation, and death combined, whereas the other data has solely reflected the rate of death of the disease or age group (but not both combined). The study shows that on average, having one health condition increases the risk by 1.79 times, and two health conditions increases the risk by 2.59 times – all compared to individuals without pre-existing conditions. However, diabetes itself is calculated to increase risk by 1.59 times. This means that compared to someone in your age group who doesn’t have diabetes, you are 1.59 times as likely to develop a case of coronavirus that requires hospitalization or ventilation.

> How might you use this data? You can look up your age group risk and multiply that risk by 1.59 (if diabetes is your only chronic illness) to assess what your risk might be compared to others in your age group. Note again – this is the increased risk of being hospitalized or dying if you do get infected with COVID-19; it does not represent share of deaths by pre-existing condition.

A Placer County man who died last week from coronavirus almost certainly became infected before he boarded a cruise ship from San Francisco to Mexico on Feb. 11, suggesting that he was exposed to the virus in the community and it has been circulating in parts of California for longer than previously reported, according to a cruise ship doctor.
Dr. Grant Tarling, chief medical officer for Carnival Corporation, which operates the Grand Princess cruise ship on which the Placer County resident had traveled, said that the man was seen by a ship doctor on Feb. 20 for serious respiratory problems. The man told the doctor that he had been feeling unwell for six or seven days, Tarling said.

That would mean the man first had symptoms on Feb. 13 or Feb. 14 — two or three days after boarding the ship in San Francisco. People infected with the coronavirus typically show symptoms no sooner than four days after exposure, studies have found.
“That would have put his exposure period before he joined the vessel,” Tarling said. “So we believe his illness was probably community acquired somewhere in California before he joined the ship.”

* So far 30 people who were on the Grand Princess on one of two recent voyages have tested positive for coronavirus. Tarling believes that the Placer County man is the “index case” at the center of the outbreak.
* The first reported case of community infection in the United States was Feb. 26, involving a Solano County woman who tested positive while she was hospitalized in Sacramento with serious illness. If the Placer County man was infected by a community exposure, that would mean the virus has been circulating in California for two weeks longer than earlier reports.
* 		
Some infectious disease experts believe that the virus probably has been circulating to some degree in the United States since early February or even January.
The timeframe of the Placer County man’s illness is not confirmed, and it’s still possible he became infected while on the ship. It’s possible that he misreported the timing of his symptoms. Also, some studies have found that the incubation period for coronavirus can be as short as one or two days."

For this, they attach to suitable cells and inject their genetic information into these cells. Infection biologists from the German Primate Center - Leibniz Institute for Primate Research in Göttingen, together with colleagues at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, have investigated how the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 penetrates cells. They have identified a cellular enzyme that is essential for viral entry into lung cells: the protease TMPRSS2. A clinically proven drug known to be active against TMPRSS2 was found to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and might constitute a novel treatment option (Cell).

>Several coronaviruses circulate worldwide and constantly infect humans, which normally caused only mild respiratory disease. Currently, however, we are witnessing a worldwide spread of a new coronavirus with more than 90,000 confirmed cases and over 3,000 deaths. The new virus has been named SARS coronavirus-2 and has been transmitted from animals to humans. It causes a respiratory disease called COVID-19 that may take a severe course. The SARS coronavirus-2 has been spreading since December 2019 and is closely related to the SARS coronavirus that caused the SARS pandemic in 2002/2003. No vaccines or drugs are currently available to combat these viruses.

The researchers identified a cellular protein that is important for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into lung cells.

*By Andrew J. Campa, Alejandra Reyes-Velarde, Alex Wigglesworth*

Amid questions over the fate of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Riverside County declared a public health emergency after confirming its first case of the coronavirus.

Riverside County public health officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser said no decisions have been made yet about the fate of Coachella and other public events. He said officials are still trying to assess the movements of the patient and whether others were exposed to the virus.

Kaiser said he will assess the safety of public events on a case-by-case basis.

Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage reported early Sunday it was treating a patient for a presumptive case of coronavirus.

The patient was tested by the Riverside County Public Health Department, according to the hospital. No further details were provided.

The hospital said the patient was in isolation and that hospital staff was taking appropriate precautions.

Riverside joins many other counties including Los Angeles and Orange counties in declaring a health emergency.

Murrieta school officials said 71 students have been placed in self-quarantine after a school employee was tested for the coronavirus.

The employee had recently been to a country where the coronavirus was spreading, according to the Murrieta Valley Unified School District, which said Murrieta Valley High School would be closed Monday and cleaned.

There have been questions about the massive Coachella music festival, set for April 10-19, and its country cousin, Stagecoach, set for April 24-26, in Indio.

Residents and businesses expressed mixed emotions about canceling the events.

The move comes as health officials warned that the country has entered a new stage in dealing with the deadly coronavirus — one in which containment is no longer possible.

“We’re past the point of containment,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration during the first two years of President Trump’s administration, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

“We have to implement broad mitigation strategies. The next two weeks are really going to change the complexion in this country. We’ll get through this, but it’s going to be a hard period. We’re looking at two months, probably, of difficulty,” Gottlieb said."

COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease, which can spread through aeroisis, which means that it can remain suspended in the air. It can also be spread through fecal matter, urine, and other bodily fluids. In fact, it is so highly infectious, that there were reports of an entire apartment building getting infected because of a single infected through shared ventilation. The events of the Diamond Princess lend credence to this. Presently, India's measures to deal with COVID-19 have been below par. Though India has surveilled and tracked down people who returned from Wuhan to India, it has not expanded its testing beyond that, especially now, when countries are beginning to see local H2H spread. 


COVID-19 is also particularly dangerous because of its long asymptomatic period, which can last from anywhere between 7 to 24 days, some have even been asymptomatic for 30 days. During the asymptomatic stage, the virus can be transmitted to other people.


In fact, scientists have stated that the asymptomatic stage is actually more infectious than the symptomatic stage. It is possible that this virus is spreading throughout India and we are not directly seeing it's effects because either most of the people who have it are currently asymptomatic OR people are dismissing the initial symptoms such as cough and fever as normal flu symptoms. The symptoms are also accompanied with respiratory distress, which then later result into pneumonia.


The problem with COVID-19 is not really its fatality rate, which is currently speculated to be 2%, the real problem is that almost 20% of the cases develop severe pneumonia which requires ICU treatment and ventilation. It does not take great imagination to foresee a scenario where thousands of people with this virus would require hospitalization, which would completely overwhelm the health services of our country. Such a scenario could result in a Wuhan like situation. 


Currently, South Korea and Italy are engaged in zealous testing for the virus, and the more they test, the more cases they seem to find. I think India is no where close to be doing the amount of testing required which can grasp the true scale of COVID-19 in India.

Therefore, it is my request to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to make an audacious attempt to try and test all the non-bacterial pneumonia cases which have developed in India over the past 2 weeks for the COVID-19. I believe that doing so will illuminate the real extent of COVID-19 in India."

Maybe as a country we were too politically torn apart as this happened to be functional in responding to it.

America needs solid, daily, consistent messaging. Firm statements people can plan their daily life around.

Coronavirus is here.  It is fairly serious.  You must be health conscious, re-think social gathering sizes, stay informed, reach out to your representatives, and diligently monitor your health. 

But, above all this month...

**Please stop from discouraging others taking this seriously.**

Most of us just want consistent, swift, coordinated response.  Sane public policy.  Humanity being good at fighting deadly disease so that the worst case scenarios don't happen.  If they do happen, then we would then know it was because a disease was that terrible, and not because our collective will was worthless.

No one should panic, but if you have not changed *anything* about your hygiene, travel plans, and taken seriously CDC/WHO sources then you *are willingly living in a fantasy land.*  And being an irresponsible citizen.

We need media voices being clearer and on fewer points, then expanding the list of points slowly into a robust mantra.

Many people are hoarding/prepping as they have no other realistic way to engage with this overwhelming information.  Humanity is simply not used to plagues and illness hitting all those around them like in older times.  We didn't have classes that clearly trained us to survive social disruption, pandemics, a public going into stockpile mode, and mixed political messages.  Many people justifiably feel out of their element during this crisis.  Unprepared.

Confused.

I want health care officials and elected leaders, **to ask me to help, tell me realistic outlooks, and explain to me how we are all going to get through this.**

Coronavirus is not an imaginary thing.  It's not a mild bug that will just go away.  That's dishonest.  

It is a troublesome illness that we could beat with coordinated effort.  Grit.  A plan.

Instead, we all see the road we are being forced to drive: it will cost us a bunch of lives, clogged ICU's, nations bickering, even more public distrust in government, and a diminished global economy.

The death toll from a hotel collapse in southeastern China on Saturday has risen to seven, with 28 people missing, according to China’s Ministry of Emergency Management. 

The hotel was being used as a coronavirus quarantine center. At the time of the collapse, 58 people were under quarantine in the hotel and all had tested negative for the coronavirus. There were also 16 hotel staff and six car dealership employees on site.

Rescuers worked through the night to search for survivors and of the 71 trapped in the building, 43 people have so far been pulled from the rubble.

Seven people have died, including one who died in hospital. Twenty-eight people are still unaccounted for."

> No other European country has yet gone as far as hard-hit Italy. But with confirmed cases of the virus spiking to more than 1,000 in France and 900 in Germany, both countries moved to halt large public gatherings, as their leaders called emergency meetings to step up the response to the epidemic.
> 
> Italy’s decision to quarantine a quarter of its population, paralyzing its economic heartland and affecting about 15 million people, sent tremors throughout Europe’s economy. It will deprive German carmakers of critical parts, force factories in other parts of Europe to close and almost certainly tip the continent into recession, according to analysts.
> 
> It is also testing Europe’s unity, which was already frayed by Britain’s departure from the bloc six weeks ago. Officials in Brussels appealed fruitlessly to France, Germany and the Czech Republic to lift controls on the export of protective medical gear, which they imposed to head off shortages at home. In Britain, some stores began imposing peacetime rationing.

Oczywiście zakładając, że nie mamy analogicznej sytuacji u nas. 

Ten ostatni przypadek pacjenta w stanie ciężkim jest jednak niepokojący, bo od infekcji mija ok 2 tygodni zanim choroba dojdzie do stanu ciężkiego, a to oznacza, że on już od ok 10 dni mógł zarażać innych. Nie ma jeszcze żadnego przypadku eksportu przypadków z Polski, co oznacza jednak, że nie ma tych przypadków  jeszcze krytycznie dużo.

Tym niemniej nie należy czekać  na dalsze potwierdzenia i działac już. Każdy musi redukowac szanse zarażenia (mycie rak, maski, trzymanie dystansu od innych), a także maksymalnie uprawiać redukcje kontaktów z innymi. Wszystkie sytuacje, gdzie się jest (zwłaszcza w pomieszczeniu) z większa liczbą osób sa bardzo ryzykowne. Podobnie wspólne jedzenie, zwłaszcza bufety, gdzie każdy ma kontakt z żywnością. Wszystkie pdoróże, które nie sa potrzebne (np. turystyczne) powinny być odwołane. Bez działań, które ograniczają ryzyko, mamy za ok 20 dni sytuację włoską, z przepełnionymi szpitalami.

Malta will not be stopping flights from Italy’s northern region, which has been sealed off over coronavirus fears, until it is advised to do so by the World Health Organisation, the health authorities have said.

...

In a statement on Sunday, the Union of Cabin Crew said its members were worried about the situation since they were the first point of interaction with travellers onboard flights from high-risk countries.

""Although our community adopts the precautions suggested by the Health Authorities, we strongly think that it is of high risk to our members and their families continuing to operate flights to high-risk countries such as northern Italy.""

""While passengers arriving from these countries are being asked to self-quarantine, the crew return home only to return to work the next day as if they are operating a flight in a normal scenario.""

The union pleaded with the authorities to stop flights operating to high-risk countries not only for the benefit of its members but also in the national interest.

Earlier, doctors reiterated their call to stop incoming passengers, saying the situation in Italy was grievous with the epidemic spreading like wildfire.

They said that the World Health Organisation’s failure to recommend travel bans had resulted in a global pandemic."

> There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website as it becomes available.

Its not pretty but its realistic to a certain extent.

I am not talking about only a normal stockmarketcrash but an almost worldwide collapse of the economy. The coronavirus-outbreak might act as a catalyst. I have friends from former yugoslavia which survived a civil war. The stories they told me were gruesome and heartbreaking.

&#x200B;

Important: guns and ammo. Fortification is helpful too.Otherwise pluderers will come and take your food, water and gold.No, most people will not be helpful, nice and caring in an extreme situation.

Dont panick, ever. Keep calm and thoughtful. 

&#x200B;

1. Shock. Those who understand will try to get out of big cities and finish last preparation. Others will feel paralyzed.
2. Empty grocery stores (people will rush them and get everything they can) and bankruns which will be futile as either banks will stay closed or currency gets worthless.
3. End of most public services (no money means there is no longer any point in fulfilling your job). Dustbins will be everywhere on he streets. People wil leventually throw waste out of their windows.
4. Things will go to waste, criminality will explode. Cars will burn. Shops will get raided. Rape will occur. Hospitals might close or cant operate due to lack of personal.
5. Eventually blackout, if things go really bad, even watertaps wont function anymore as many areas are dependent on pumps which are dependent on electricity.
6. Desperate people will suicide. A lot of people will. Corpses on streets and their smell will drive a lot of people crazy. Children wont be spared aswell. Lots of orphans. Straying dogs will feed on them and can cause a medium threat. Rats aswell.
7. Remaining people will fight each other, houses and flats will be plundered. Pluderers will be shot by inbound national guard / army / police. Arresting is not an option.
8. Streets and bridges will be blocked by the army. Checkpoints will be blocking people from moving like normal.
9. Plunderers will at some point fatigue as its exhausting.
10. Weakened plunderers will be eliminated by army. Prepare for long fights. Anarchists and splinter groups will see their ultimate chance. Asymmetric warfare.
11. If shit hits the fan hard, a foreign country will try to use the weakened state as a simple target and an actual war starts. An event like this is an unique chance.
12. Eventually, the most powerful group will erect a new order, executed and protected by force. Desperate people will grab the straw and accept them as their new leaders.
13. New leadership will rebuild things to a certain extent. Peace will be restored.
14. After basic infrastructure will be restored, advanced infrastructure will offer jobs and opportunities. Gold, silver and bitcoin (and maybe some other crypto like ETH or XMR) will be the only valid payment as except for physical goods they will be the only things of value from the old system that survived. Real estate and cars will become ridiculously cheap as there will be far more houses than people alive.
15. Economy will boom.

Things can happen in different order aswell obviously. This is why the rich have underground bunkers and islands or houses in the nowhere. They will just have kind of longtime-vacation while the ordinary people will starve, die and suffer to death.

FIFTEEN ethical principles for admission and discharge of patients in the time of Coronavirus. Knowing that the Italian healthcare facility may not be able to accommodate them all and therefore will have to make choices.

""Forecasts for the Coronavirus epidemic (Covid-19) in some Italian regions estimate an increase in cases of such magnitude for the coming weeks, in many centers, to determine a huge imbalance between the real clinical needs of the population and the actual availability of intensive resources ”, read in the technical report of the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Siaarti Intensive Care.

“It is a scenario in which criteria for access to intensive care (and discharge) may be necessary, not only strictly of clinical appropriateness and proportionality of care, but also inspired by a criterion as shared as possible of distributive justice. A scenario of this kind can be substantially assimilated to the field of ""disaster medicine"", for which ethical reflection has over time developed many concrete indications for doctors and nurses engaged in difficult choices "".

Among the 15 extraordinary criteria, which concern all intensive patients and not only patients infected with Covid-19 infection, we read that it may be necessary to limit the age of entry for example: reserve resources that could be very scarce for those who it has first of all more probabilities of survival and secondly to whom can have more years of life saved.

Home » SUITABLE SEATING FAQ
SUITABLE SEATING FAQ
By Alex Hernaez on June 10, 2011
POSTED IN WAGE AND HOUR
This presentation was prepared by my colleagues David Faustman and Cristina K. Armstrong:

1.      Do we need to provide seats for our employees?

 

Yes. Section 14 of almost all of the Wage Orders provides the following:

·        All working employees shall be provided with suitable seats when the nature of the work reasonably permits the use of seats; and

·        When employees are not engaged in the active duties of their employment and the nature of the work requires standing, an adequate number of suitable seats shall be placed in reasonable proximity to the work area and employees shall be permitted to use such seats when it does not interfere with the performance of their duties.

Ultimately, the Wage Order obligates retail employers to provide seats to all of their employees, regardless of whether that employee requests a seat and in addition to any cashiers who require a seat as a reasonable accommodation. Neither the Courts, nor the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) have provided any substantive guidance on what constitutes “suitable seating” for employees.

Only Wage Order 17 (Miscellaneous Employees) does not have a provision for Seats. Wage Order 14 (Agricultural Occupations) and Wage Order 16 (Construction, Drilling, Logging and Mining Industries) have provisions for Seats that are more specific to their industries.

2.      What type of seat is “suitable”?

 

Suitability may depend on the circumstances of the workplace. A basic stool or chair that is capable of holding an average person is likely acceptable in most workplaces. In some workplaces, a bench or seat that folds down from a wall may be most practical.

 

3.      How many seats are necessary in each workplace?

 

The number of seats necessary at each workplace will depend on the nature of the business and the circumstances at each workplace. Ideally, an employer should provide one seat per employee per shift. As a practical matter, however, this may not be possible. Given the fluid nature of retail work, one seat for every three employees should be sufficient. This number, however, is not a threshold amount, and should be used a guidance in assessing your particular situation.

4.      Where must the seats be located?

 

The exact location of a seat is left to the employer’s discretion, but the Wage Order does require that seats be placed in reasonable proximity to the work area. It is advised that at least one seat be available at each cash stand, and that all break rooms and back offices be equipped with seats. In locations where employees are required to walk around, care should be taken to place seats in locations where employees can easily view their work area so that they are immediately ready to engage customers when necessary. 

 

5.      Do employees need to be allowed to sit down during all working hours? 

 

No. The Wage Order does not implement a blanket requirement that all employees must be able to sit at any time. It does, however, require that employees be allowed to sit down if the nature of their work reasonably permits the use of seats. For example, a cashier in most retail environments must be allowed to sit down because the nature of their work in ringing up sales reasonably permits them to sit during the performance of those job duties.

6.      What about employees that are required to move around as part of their job duties?

 

The Wage Order recognizes that some jobs require employees to stand and move around. The employees are entitled to have seating available near their work area. The employees must be allowed to sit when it does not interfere with the performance of their job duties. For example, a non-cashier retail associate whose job duties include customer service and restocking shelves on the sales floor must be allowed to sit in the event that there are no customers in the store and her other job duties have been completed.

7.      Can I fire an employee who refuses to stand up during the performance of his duties?

 

It depends on whether the employee’s work reasonably allows him to sit. Employers cannot prohibit employees from sitting down if sitting down does not interfere with the performance of their job duties. The termination of an employee who asserts his right to sit down, when the nature of his job reasonably allows, is a violation of Labor Code, and may be the basis for a wrongful discharge claim.

 

8.      What are the penalties for non-compliance?

Although the Wage Order does not contain a penalty for violation of this provision California courts have held that employees can recover penalties for a violation of this Wage Order under California’s Private Attorney General Act of 2004 (PAGA). PAGA sets a penalty of $100 per employee per pay period for the initial violation, and $200 for each subsequent violation. Assessed penalties are divided between the state and the aggrieved employees pursuant to the statute. Despite the one year statute of limitations, it is not difficult to imagine the substantial amount of potential penalties that could arise under PAGA in a class action based on the suitable seating requirements of the Wage Order.

 

9.      What other steps can an employer take to minimize its legal risk?

Employers should audit their job descriptions and policies and revise any statements which prohibit sitting down or mandate standing up during the workday. Employers should consider implementing a policy which provides for suitable seating in all of its workplaces where the nature of the work reasonably permits the use of seats.

Update – July 21, 2011:

Do employers have to offer seats to all employees or only those employees who ask?  This is an open question.  Read how one court answered the question here.

There is still a chance that as a young person, you may progress to a level of disease severity that requires escalated hospital care. Do not fall into the trap of comparing COVID-19 to the flu.  The flu is a seasonal illness that we are equipped to more or less handle on a systems level (although some years can be particularly bad). This is an entirely new virus that we have to deal with, on top of the background normal flu cases. Our healthcare system could be instantly overwhelmed overnight.  Many hospitals in Portland already operate at or near capacity in the winter months at baseline. 

There's still much to learn about the virus, but don't dismiss the data that's already available. I recommend reading some of the landmark Lancet or NEJM papers to get a better sense. This virus can be very deadly in older populations.  Read some of the personal accounts published by front-line healthcare workers in China. Many of them lost colleagues. Those colleagues were middle aged and otherwise healthy. This is not the flu.  There is no way I would want to role the dice and let my 60+ year old mother or other family members become infected.  

Do not become complacent. This could very easily turn into a public health crisis overnight.  Be very diligent with hand hygiene. Take the measures recommended by CDC to heart. 

The colossal efforts of the Chinese government saved many thousands of lives.  We have barely lifted a finger in dealing with this. 

If you can get around the paywall, this article will help put into perspective what it's like to live and work in a community heavily affected by COVID-19. It's heart wrenching.

Then the bodies own immune system tries to kill the virus by killing its own cells that contain the virus. Corona virus is known for how rapidly it spreads and develops, so it can infect a lot of cells quickly. 

Young people can mount a significant immune response very quickly and get rid of the virus before it gets out of control and into too many cells. I.e. immediately after the virus enters the nose/mouth/throat/eyes and then those cells are just shed away easily. 

Older people’s immune responses aren’t as quick because the bone marrow (where the immune cells are made) starts to shrink with age. So immune responses don’t start as rapidly, and aren’t as strong as a response. fortunately most elderly people have become immune to most common viruses over time though, through exposure so they don’t tend to get common colds etc. But the coronavirus is a new strain so we don’t have any immunity. So the immune response is slow despite the rapidly replicating virus. So it spreads quickly and into a lot of cells, and in particularly down into the lung cells. Meaning the body starts to destroy the lung tissues and the person gets a pneumonia from it. And you can’t use antibiotics for viruses so it relies on the persons ability to fight it off. Which elderly people cannot mount a good enough response. So it will continue to spread inside the body. 

Also because elderly people’s organs may not be able to withstand the stress that occurs when the body starts to fight off a big illness, so their organs can start to fail which may be irreversible. 

Same goes with people for chronic diseases - their immune system isn’t as good and their organs that are damaged may not have the reserve to cope with the added stress from the infection (especially heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease)

Hopefully that explains it. Sorry it’s a bit long winded haha."

One has a ""silent"" incubation period of max 7 days, the other 14. Capacity for spread is greatly exacerbated by how easily it gets around as well; if i cough on a public train estimates say I could infect considerably more than i would if i had the flu. Mortality rates conflict but show Covid ballparking the same if not higher mortality rate in elderly, immunocompromised and the very young. Plus we have vaccines for the flu and while its very hit or miss whether we vaccinate against the right strain year by year theres a somewhat reasonable expectation by the general public that it can be avoided with good effort. No such comfort with covid.

The whole cocktail mixed up means its a highly infectious disease, objectively moreso than the flu, with outcomes that are shoddy at best and inconsistent at worst for those who desperately need to be kept from it. Plus, theres nothing anyone can do about it but pray the people next to them on the subway don't have it. The flu is at least predictable and preventable somewhat, covid doesnt fall along those lines and I at least sympathize with mass concern (minus the hysteria)"

Basically you’re bleeding out of your blood vessels.
ANGELA RASMUSSEN, VIROLOGIST

Humans rely on our immune systems to keep their cool when facing a threat. But during a runaway coronavirus infection, when the immune system dumps cytokines into the lungs without any regulation, this culling becomes a free-for-all, Rasmussen says “Instead of shooting at a target with a gun, you’re using a missile launcher,” she says. That’s where the problem arises: Your body is not just targeting the infected cells. It is attacking healthy tissue too.

The implications extend outside the lungs. Cytokine storms create inflammation that weakens blood vessels in the lungs and causes fluid to seep through to the air sacs. “Basically you’re bleeding out of your blood vessels,” Rasmussen says. The storm spills into your circulatory system and creates systemic issues across multiple organs.

From there, things can take a sharp turn for the worse. In some of the most severe COVID-19 cases, the cytokine response—combined with a diminished capacity to pump oxygen to the rest of the body—can result in multi-organ failure. Scientists don’t know exactly why some patients experience complications outside of the lung, but it might be linked to underlying conditions like heart disease or diabetes.

“Even if the virus doesn’t get to kidneys and liver and spleen and other things, it can have clear downstream effects on all of those processes,” Frieman says. And that’s when things can get serious.
Liver: Collateral damage

“Once a virus gets into your bloodstream, they can swim to any part of your body,” Lok says. “The liver is a very vascular organ so [a coronavirus] can very easily get into your liver.”

Your liver works pretty hard to make sure your body can function properly. Its main job is to process your blood after it leaves the stomach, filtering out the toxins and creating nutrients your body can use. It also makes the bile that helps your small intestine break down fats. Your liver also contains enzymes, which speed up chemical reactions in the body.

In a normal body, Lok explains, liver cells are constantly dying off and releasing enzymes into your bloodstream. This resourceful organ then quickly regenerates new cells and carries on with its day. Because of that regeneration process, the liver can withstand a lot of injury.

When you have abnormally high levels of enzymes in your blood, though—as has been a common characteristic of patients suffering from SARS and MERS—it’s a warning sign. It might be a mild injury that the liver will quickly bounce back from or it could be something more severe—even liver failure.


Lok says scientists don’t completely understand how these respiratory viruses behave in the liver. The virus might be directly infecting the liver, replicating and killing off the cells itself. Or those cells might be collateral damage as your body’s immune response to the virus sets off a severe inflammatory reaction in the liver.

Either way, she notes that liver failure was never the sole cause of death for SARS patients. “By the time the liver fails,” she says, “oftentimes you’ll find that the patient not only has lung problems and liver problems but they may also have kidney problems. By then it becomes a systemic infection.”

Kidney: It’s all connected
Yes, your kidneys are caught up in this mess, too. Six percent of SARS patients—and a full quarter of MERS patients—suffered acute renal injury. Studies have shown the novel coronavirus can do the same. It may be a relatively uncommon feature of the disease, but it is a fatal one. Ultimately 91.7 percent of SARS patients with acute renal impairment died, according to a 2005 study in Kidney International.

Like the liver, your kidneys act as a filter your blood. Each kidney is filled with about 800,000 of microscopic distilling units called nephrons. These nephrons have two main components: a filter to clean the blood and a little tubes that return the good stuff back to your body or send the waste down to your bladder as urine.

It’s the kidney tubules that seem to be most affected by these zoonotic coronaviruses. After the SARS outbreak, the WHO reported that the virus was found in kidney tubules, which can become inflamed.

It’s not uncommon to detect a virus in the tubules if it’s in your bloodstream, says Kar Neng Lai, a professor emeritus at the University of Hong Kong and consultant nephrologist at Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital. As your kidneys are continuously filtering blood, sometimes the tubular cells can trap the virus and cause a transient, or milder, injury.

That injury could become lethal if the virus penetrates the cells and begins to replicate. But Lai—who was also a member of the first group of researchers reporting on SARS and contributed to the Kidney International study—says there was no evidence that the SARS virus was replicating in the kidney.

That finding, Lai says, suggests acute kidney injury in SARS patients might be due to a diverse set of causes, including low blood pressure, sepsis, drugs, or a metabolic disturbance. Meanwhile, the more severe cases that led to acute renal failure showed signs of—you guessed it—a cytokine storm.

Acute renal failure can also sometimes be brought on by antibiotics, multi-organ failure, or being connected to a ventilator for too long. Everything is connected.

Pregnancy and coronavirus?
It’s the great irony of the Twitter age that we know too little about the novel coronavirus as we drown in information updates about it. Medical journals have published several studies about this outbreak—some more vetted than others as researchers rush to feed the maw. Meanwhile, news outlets are reporting every development. All this information whirls around the internet where discerning fact from fiction is a notorious challenge.

“This is really unprecedented in terms of the up-to-the-minute reporting on what’s going on in these studies,” Rasmussen says. “It’s really tricky trying to sort through all of the information and figure out what’s really supported, what’s speculative, and what’s plain wrong.”

For example last week, doctors at a hospital in Wuhan reported that two infants tested positive for the novel coronavirus, one just 30 hours after birth. Naturally, this troubling headline spread across news organizations, given it raised questions of whether pregnant women can infect their unborn children in utero or whether the disease can be transmitted during birth or through breast milk.

But let’s pump the brakes. Mother-to-infant transmission wasn’t observed with SARS nor MERS despite numerous cases involving pregnant women. Plus, there are other ways a newborn could catch the coronavirus, Rasmussen says, such as by being born at hospital overrun with infected patients during a hectic emergency.

In fact, a new study published Thursday in The Lancet offers preliminary evidence that the coronavirus cannot be passed from mother to child.

In the report, researchers observed nine women in Wuhan who had COVID-19 pneumonia. Some of the women had pregnancy complications, but all cases resulted in live births without evidence of transmitting the infection. While this study doesn’t completely rule out the possibility of transmission during pregnancy, it underscores the need to exercise caution in speculating about this disease.

“There needs to be a high standard of evidence before you can say that’s happening definitively—and certainly before you start making changes to how cases are managed clinically or in terms of public policy,” Rasmussen says.

Frieman agrees. He hopes this epidemic will prompt more funding for coronavirus research like the recent pledges from the European Union and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Last Thursday, China’s National Health Commission said more than 1,700 health care workers are ill with the new virus, and the announcement came just a day after the WHO wrapped a summit on the best protocols for hospital care and the development of therapeutics, like vaccines.

Frieman wants the support and interest to last even if this outbreak eventually fizzles out, unlike what happened with SARS research.


“Right after the SARS outbreak, there was a big bunch of money and then it went away,” Frieman says. “Why don’t we have these answers? Nobody funded these things.”"

Hello_____, 

I wanted to reach out and begin the process of getting my son in independent study due to the spread of the coronavirus. I have family that is vulnerable, and want to mitigate the risk to them. I also wanted to urge the school to be proactive, rather than reactive, and close the school to help slow the spread of the virus.

I understand that kids aren't at risk of being harmed by the coronavirus. The danger is they are vectors for the spread of the virus to those who are at risk. Stepping up cleaning of the school and having kids wash their hands more only helps a small degree, as students are still gathering in close quarters and are far from good at keeping germs to themselves. Government authorities and employers are instructing adults to distance themselves by canceling events and having people work from home. What about the students who naturally gather together and are much less adept at germ control?

Moreover, the risks of the disease aren't just whether or not you'll get it. It’s about the hospitals being overburdened and our health care workers getting sick—and when you need your special meds, or if your family member has a non-coronavirus emergency. Just like getting vaccines is about protecting the vulnerable, so too is preparing and having students stay home about protecting others. We are beyond trying to contain the coronavirus. I've read many articles (see links below) urging that the next step is slowing the virus with social distancing. That is why I'm choosing to keep Victor home, and urge you to close the school.

What are the next steps for getting my son on independent study? Thank you!

Also, with certain countries, there are structural impediments preventing a comprehensive national response because their systems incentivize local governments hoarding resources against each other.

If COVID-19 spreads very widely, which seems almost certain at this point, it could be useful to leverage people's mobile devices to track the spread so as to better allocate resources.

Possible advantages:

* Counteract scarcity of direct testing by having users input their symptoms, location, and history of contacting travelers. The influx of noisy data can be statistically combined with known cases to produce individual likelihood predictions of who has the disease, and where.
* Provide an infrastructure to send people direct alerts regarding medical availability in their area. Provide a way of notifying people to start seriously quarantining themselves if things get bad in their area.
* Keep virus prevention measures salient in people's minds through the simple reminder of seeing the app on their phone.

Possible downsides that I can think of:

* Too many false positives leads to bad data and heightened panic, worsening shortages of supplies.
* Limited usefulness due to too many asymptomatic cases.
* False sense of security.

Such an app would need be be *officially* sanctioned, so as to prevent the spread of misinformation and provide a useful data-gathering infrastructure for health experts. It appears that tech companies are cracking down on independently-made apps for fear of spreading misinformation and panic: see [this article.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21167102/apple-google-coronavirus-iphone-apps-android-misinformation-reject-ban) 

It seems to me that the risk of false positives and heightened panic is a worthwhile trade for more data and faster collective action, especially if things start to actually get as bad as the forecasts. I don't think that an app would cause any more panic than the news media is already producing, and if the data is bad or nobody adopts the app, we can just ignore it and keep doing other measures.

I think this is worthwhile attempting, at the very least to see if such a measure would be at all workable and useful against future pandemics."

That being said, Mers, another related coronavirus that we do have more experience with and more epidemiological data, does in fact kill more males.”

Somehow, for millennia, science and society have managed to overlook all of this. We have preferred the strong-man myth. “As a physician and scientist, the schooling that I got was that men are stronger” — meaning not just more muscular but all-round more robust — “It took me 20 years to deconstruct that paradigm.”

Moalem knows there is going to be resistance to his theory. “I thought a lot about that while I was considering whether to write this book. It’s a dangerous idea and it’s going to upset a lot of people. It probably has already. Whenever you’re swapping paradigms, there’s a lot of resistance. But it’s such a fundamental rule of biology that ignoring it is to our detriment when it comes to the medical applications. That’s what gave me the impetus and the courage to say, you know, it’s time now for us to make a change.”

One way in which it has been to our detriment is in drug prescriptions. Bizarrely, Moalem says, scientists prefer to use male mice to test drugs. “To this day, preclinical research does not require you to use both female and male mice,” he says.
Of course, there are studies that use female mice, but scientists often veer towards using males because they are less hormonal than females, which, they say, makes for clearer data. But there’s a drawback, says Moalem: as a result, doctors find that women report more side effects from drugs than men. This is not because they are weaker, but because they are being overdosed on the basis of tests performed on male mice. Women’s bodies hold on to drugs, including alcohol, longer, so the effects and the side effects are intensified.

For Moalem, the central truth underlying his thesis is that women are better built. The reason fewer female babies are born than male is that the construction process is more tricky, so slightly more female embryos and foetuses are rejected before birth. “Building a woman is an immensely complicated process. It has to go perfectly. If it doesn’t, then everything is lost.”

Moalem believes that the reason for all this lies deep within women’s cells. Humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes — gene-bearing coils of DNA — in each of our cells. But one of these pairs — the sex chromosomes — differs in men and women. In women, it consists of two so-called X chromosomes — one from her mother and one from her father; in men, it consists of an X from the mother and a Y from the father. The Y chromosome’s primary function is to produce testes and sperm, and is relatively poor in genetic information compared with the X chromosome.

For years it was believed that one of the two X chromosomes in women was effectively silenced. This fed straight into the “men are stronger” mythology. There was even a set of novels and a TV series — The XYY Man — which suggested having two Ys made you stronger, inclined to criminality. This is nonsense.

In reality, about a quarter of the genes on the “silenced” X chromosome are still active and accessible to female cells. So she has two possible sources of genetic information to fight disease, hunger or exhaustion. Men only have one. So having two Xs is, in Moalem’s view, the source of female superiority.

“We now know why it’s so important, because so many of the genes that are used to make the brain are on the X chromosome. And so many of the genes that are involved in the immune function are on the X. It’s like having 23 volumes of instruction manuals for your house.

But the one that is the most crucial for humans is the one about the brain and immunity. Without immunity, we’re not going to be around much.”

Moalem is an energetic polymath. He was born in Montreal and now works and practises in New York, where he has become something of a media star. In 2007 his bestselling book Survival of the Sickest made the case that some diseases helped us live longer. His next bestseller, in 2009, was How Sex Works, which ran through all the latest material on sexuality and why people find each other attractive.

“I’m always driven by very simple questions or just a string of questions that eventually ends up with one question, which I then can’t get any satisfactory answer for. And if I get blank stares or laughter, I know I’m onto something interesting.”

So he goes for the big, hidden ideas and he sells them with fierce energy. He is 43 and has a taut, slightly corporate air, dressed in a bright blue suit and light brown wingtip shoes. He has an instinct for seeking out what others miss, oddities that point to a deeper, less familiar truth. The resilience of women, for example, was buried not just by mythology but also by misguided theory. He noticed this while still a student.

“Someone would say, well, why were most medical studies done using men? And they’d say, well, they’re stronger. We don’t want to take the risk of using a woman, who is the weaker sex; we may harm her. Men are made of stronger stuff and they can take it. That’s what was implanted in me and my colleagues. For me, everything I was seeing was telling me the opposite. We confused the idea of being able to throw a spear farther than a woman and being able to run faster and lift more things that are heavy with an organismal strength.”

Greater female longevity used to be explained by the fact that men behaved badly — they took more risks, went to war, smoked more, drank more, got into fights more and so on. But this did not explain male weaknesses that were clearly inborn.

“Besides the developmental errors that seem to happen more in males, the other thing I kept seeing was a survival advantage in neonatal intensive care units, with very young, very small children,” Moalem says. “When I would speak to the nurses, they were wells of wisdom because they’d been doing this same job for 30 years. They’d say, we’ve been telling physicians this for the longest time. Whenever we see a boy and a girl in similar circumstances, we’re more concerned for the boys. So if we’re seeing a survival advantage there, then it’s not behavioural.

For women, there is a downside to all this. There’s a perceived paradox about female longevity: although they live longer than men, they also tend to suffer more illnesses in their lives. This was a puzzle, but now, Moalem says, we may have solved it. “It’s not that women get more ill, it’s that men get ill and die. So the fact is, it’s not a paradox. The answer for it is simple — women are just not dying.”

There is one type of illness that women suffer from more than men. The second X chromosome gives them the benefit of a more effective immune system, but it may also mean they are more vulnerable to autoimmune diseases in which the body attacks itself. These include rheumatoid arthritis, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and more than 100 others. As with cancer, men are more likely to die from such diseases, but, unlike cancer, women are more likely to be afflicted in the first place."

The general public is buying facemasks at an alarming rate and putting health care workers at risk in doing so. You don't need to wear a facemask unless you are acutally sick or interacting with someone who is (as in health care), and wearing one incorrectly can actually increase the risk of it spreading."

It seems that everybody is doing their own thing right now (didn't Denmark release a case yesterday?), and there is even some tension after France and Germany said they would ban the export of masks (with other countries demanding some kind of mechanism to distribute masks throughout the EU).

The EU is more of a fairweather friends club, whenever there's a serious situation (financial crisis, refugees, COVID-19), everybody is pulling into different directions. And to be more precise, this time the EU doesn't even seem to play a significant role at all. That's really sad to see, because this situation could clearly benefit from some coordination at least, but I don't expect anything to come out of this during this outbreak (they should have acted already 6 weeks ago to make a difference)."

Aaaand stop.  This is not the flu.  It's not influenza.  It is much more infectious (influenza has an R0 of 1.3, COVID-19 has one from 2-3 at minimum) and much more lethal (WHO places it at 3.4%, which likely artificially high thanks to un-diagnosed cases, but even a 1% mortality rate would be 10x that of influenza).  Roughly 20% of people infected by COVID-19 require hospitalization or medical assistance of some kind (oxygen, etc).
