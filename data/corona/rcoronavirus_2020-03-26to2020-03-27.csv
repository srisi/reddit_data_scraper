The state shutdowns is purely to prevent the hospitals from being overwhelmed.  It is *not* meant to stop the spread.  Stopping the spread simply is not possible.

The shutdowns will be lifted as soon as the curve drops to the point where we can resume society and hospitals can handle the influx of cases.  This will occur while the pandemic is still occurring.  It is a necessary evil.  The economy will quite literally be destroyed for several years if we don't do this. 

We are very likely to see a 2nd wave that may or may not result in another shutdown.  We won't know that outcome for a while.  But we will have to at least partially reopen society and accept that a 2nd wave will happen.  It's going to happen either way."

\-New York State today [has 37,258 cases, as per NYTimes.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html)

&#x200B;

\-According to the Governor, [cases are doubling every 3 days, and we are 14-21 days away from apex, as per NPR 2 days ago.](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/24/820891370/coronavirus-n-y-infection-rate-is-doubling-about-every-3-days-cuomo-says)

&#x200B;

\-So now for a little bit of math, just a back of the envelope calculation. Based on [this curve of number of cases vs time](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html), the rate of increase keeps going up until the apex, so assuming Cuomo's definition of apex means the peak of this curve, we will ""double"" the number of cases 4 or 6 times (4 intervals or 6 intervals of 3 days based on the 12-19 days until apex from today), and this is assuming no further decrease in days required to double the cases until apex. So, we will therefore have somewhere between 37,258\*2\^4 and 37,258\*2\^6 cases until we hit our peak rate of cases, so anywhere between 596128 and 2384512 cases in NY State alone until we hit the peak.

&#x200B;

\-That's not all. This is only until we hit the peak. The curve is symmetric, so the total number of cases before the peak=total number of cases after the peak, so one more 2X multiplication. So NY State alone, based on my crude math and the numbers we see in the news, will see anywhere between 1.2 million and 4.8 million cases, which is anywhere between 6% to 25% of its total population, with significant social distancing and other measures.

&#x200B;

\-Surely (I hope) something is wrong somewhere either with Cuomo's statements or these numbers, but us being 2-3 weeks from the halfway point seems absurd."

> >I think it would be helpful if I cleared up some confusion that has emerged in recent days. Some have interpreted my evidence to a UK parliamentary committee as indicating we have substantially revised our assessments of the potential mortality impact of COVID-19. **This is not the case. Indeed, if anything, our latest estimates suggest that the virus is more transmissible than previously thought. Our lethality estimates remain unchanged**. My evidence to Parliament referred to the numbers of deaths we assess might occur in the UK in the presence of the very intensive social distancing and other public health interventions now in place. Without those interventions, our assessment remains that the UK would see the scale of deaths reported in our study (namely, up to approximately 500 thousand).

> On March 26 2020, the Daily Wire’s Amanda Prestigiacomo published a piece headlined, “Epidemiologist Behind Highly-Cited Coronavirus Model Drastically Revises Model,” which claimed that the primary researcher on Imperial College London’s influential COVID-19 paper was “wrong” and that he had “offered a massive revision” to the globally referenced research.

Except there's a reason those were scaled back. Even Ferguson's original model outright said ""[*If nothing is done*, we'll see hundreds of thousands of deaths](https://twitter.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1243260629307310081)."" Bafflingly, that first phrase is omitted and people are instead saying, ""See? He was full of bullshit after all."" It's at such a point that I'm wondering if there's an agenda behind it. 

The 20,000 number even factored into that original report as the low end of what could happen to the UK [if they went ahead with Boris Johnson's plan](https://twitter.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1243260980999708672?), which alarmed him so much that they actually took precautions. And now that number has been revised accordingly.

Yet here in the USA, we're just going full juche to say that there was no threat in the first place and are actively trying to make the higher, scarier ends of it come true. That's not negativity."

The main reason as I see it, is that Coronavirus was something the average person could do some online research on and prepare ourselves before the majority of Americans ever heard the word.  You cannot bullshit the educated, and you cannot hide from piles of dead bodies and a collapsed economy.  Sooner or later, nobody will be able to spin everything into a positive light and his approval will go down, ironically,  exponentially."

>  
>Also, **many people wear** [**surgical masks**](https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/why-do-japanese-people-wear-surgical-masks-its-not-always-for-health-reasons). Usually this is done by those with colds or flu, to prevent others from getting sick. A mask can block someone from exhaling infectious droplets. But perhaps more importantly, it can signal other people to keep their distance.  
>  
>**Wearing a mask could serve as a relatively costly signal that someone is serious about social distancing. It’s costly because it looks unattractive and causes other people to treat you with suspicion**. Thus, it could be a forceful, effective message to others to stay away when otherwise they might not respect your boundaries.  
>  
>The U.S. could benefit from this approach, especially now. **In the U.S., where wearing masks isn't common or widely accepted,** the signal could be even more powerful. Americans are unused to the idea of social distancing and many aren’t yet taking it [seriously](https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1239716041397121024). Furthermore, because many Americans don’t understand how epidemics can explode in a very short period of time, they may be inclined to disobey shutdowns and [party on](https://twitter.com/bustedcoverage/status/1239207942823522304) as if nothing’s wrong.  
>  
>**But if even a few more Americans wear masks, it could send a credible signal** to all those who might otherwise disdain authoritarian government directives or breathless media reports. The **mask-wearers would get funny looks or even taunts initially, but their presence would help convince their** **skeptical neighbors** that this is an unusual and serious situation requiring an unusual and serious response.

Luckily, I have access to a great team of doctors. If anyone wants to be checked up on, or have been experiencing similar symptoms, or has had senses returned please DM.

I would suggest (some more obvious than others) drinking at least a gallon of water a day, try to achieve clinical doses of vitamin C and D, take andrographis, curcumin, hydroxytyrosol if you can get your hands on it, and rest.

1. It takes some time to die for patients. It might take a week or longer before deaths rapidly go higher and higher

3. People that died in the US aren’t counted for deaths of corona yet because they haven’t been tested.

>During an online question-and-answer session with Warriors guard Stephen Curry on Thursday morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci made one thing clear: The coronavirus crisis should not be taken lightly.
Asked whether people were overreacting about the spread of the respiratory disease, Fauci — the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — didn’t mince words, saying, “This is serious business.”

Speaking on an Instagram live feed, Fauci explained what someone should do if he or she believes they have the coronavirus, how to best practice social distancing and why this pandemic might not completely go away any time soon. As Fauci put it, “You need to see the trajectory of the curve start to come down. … Europe, particularly Italy, is in a terrible situation.
“They’re still going way up. The United States is a big country. We have so many different regions. It’s particularly bad in New York City right now, yet there are places in the country that are doing really quite well. You could probably identify people who have it, get them out of circulation, whereas in New York City, it’s doing what’s called ‘mitigation,’ trying to prevent as best you can the spread.”

Not surprisingly, Curry’s Q&A with Dr. Fauci attracted a massive viewership. Among the celebrities who commented on it were former President Barack Obama, Justin Bieber, Common and Heat forward Andre Iguodala."

>The US government hasn't provided any substantive assistance to us, but it was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travelers. **What it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a very bad example.** Even American media and experts doubted the government's decision, saying that the US government's restrictions on China are precisely what the WHO rejects, that the US is turning from overconfidence to **fear and overreaction**, and that banning the entry of visitors who traveled to China in the past 14 days is suspected to be **violating civil rights** instead of reducing risks of virus spreading. In fact, according to a recent CDC report, the US flu from 2019 to 2020 has caused 19 million infection cases and at least 10,000 deaths. By contrast, by February 2, 17,205 cases of nCoV pneumonia were confirmed, 361 died and 475 cured and discharged, while there are only 11 confirmed cases in the US. The contrast is thought-provoking. I also noted that the Canadian Minister of Health said Canada won't follow the US and impose travel restrictions on Chinese or foreign nationals who have been to China. Canada believes the ban of entry has no basis, which is a sharp contrast to the US behaviors.

There’s probably no way to separate the snowbirds but I imagine they are not even counted in the FL census (where my FL % is from) since it’s not their primary residence. I don’t know, though. If they’re not represented in the Census, then the population over 65 is probably MUCH higher than in Italy.

Do you really think most FL snowbirds are Canadian? I’m sure there are plenty (I’ve seen pleeeeenty of Canadian plates on 81), but there are also hordes of snowbirds from PA and NY state. I’d like to see the statistics if they exist."

As a country we should not be in the business of legislating morality and health so long as it doesn’t affect other people. Yes, this could affect others. So could the cigerette panic buying and the black market that will emerge. 

Maybe ban smoking in public, ban smoking around kids (even in your own home) but otherwise leave it be. This is just something that needs to be accounted for when deciding how severe our quarantines will need to be."
