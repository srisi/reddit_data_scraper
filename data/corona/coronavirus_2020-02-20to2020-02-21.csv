Yesterday during the session [I suggested getting puts to hedge for today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f69d94/daily_discussion_thread_february_19_2020/fi3xodp/) I didn't expect as large a drop as we had, which broke the [first support given in yesterday's post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6hd6q/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_20_2020/fi4ueqz/) As [I posted last week when we were wondering if there would be a Friday sell-off,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3guwk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_14/fhisg20/) breaking of the first support at 335.3 led to selling to 334.7 and a reversal there.

Throughout the day I posted that another small put hedge is a good idea for tomorrow because of the first bit of economic news of the week finally coming up, and G20 this weekend which may cause more risk averse traders to sell off some. We don't have a true bear flag, but if it ""completes,"" the drop is expect to be to 333.2ish, though a small gap to about 332.8 still needs to be filled so it could reach something as low as that. Those ranges represent the next support. If the economic news is good and you're a bull, it is most ideal to exceed the price point of a drop-- around 338.5. To see if we're in another mini-correction we would need to see another ""lower high"" being set, so exceeding 337.8ish would be the beginnings of a positive sign.

Futures are right on the cusp of breaking our current bullish price channel back into the lower one we had during the coronavirus announcement, so if you're a bull you hope that the pajama traders start buying.

Good luck to all tomorrow and get those tendies."

Implying not one of those 15 infected anyone else.

Implying nobody else who was infected, or asymptomatic arrived on our shores in the mean time

Ok.

Lying about the #'s will produce an even worse panic than if the public was fed accurate #s all along, causing a gradually increasing level of concern and preparation.

Instead we're LIKELY to have a SHTF day with the stock market collapsing, runs on grocery stores and pharmacies, stations out of gas, everything at once.

Everyone has the flu here.  A and B equally.  If you have a slight fever,  stay home.  If you need to go to your doctor for something that can wait, stay home because you’ll get the flu by sitting in the waiting room.  Clinically there will be no way to tell if someone has corona because the symptoms are the same.  I haven’t seen an uptick in pneumonia and due to mycoplasma and flu that’s going to be difficult to distinguish except statistically across a large number of patients.  Flu tests are nearly pointless currently as they aren’t accurate during an epidemic due to statistics I don’t feel like ‘splaining.  Same with Mycoplasma which has been epidemic for 2 years.

I have zero doubt Coronavirus will be epidemic in the United States.  If it can be pushed out of flu season that will help diagnosis and mortality.
If you want to accomplish that, international travel to Asia and the Middle East and North Africa needs to temporarily stop.

It is a foregone conclusion,  but delaying it two months will help dramatically.

I don’t want to dox myself but I’ll just say I graduated from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.  DeBakey is our god.

In response to many requests to break out the cruise ship data, but still wanting to show the overall world growth, this animated graph shows the growth of the cases divided by continent, with International Conveyance (i.e. ships between continents) in their own category. I'm hoping this new format will give everyone a better view of the data.

I am still working on a new extrapolation method, this time based on rate of growth and infection rate, as suggested by another redditor. I'll try to add that in within the next couple of days.

After the initial Wuhan outbreak, when cases were popping up all over the world, someone brought the virus to Iran. Since Iran is dealing with so much else at the moment -  political tension and instability, protests, inflation - testing for Coronavirus was not a top priority. 

So for the past few weeks, people with symptoms were ignored, or mistaken as flu victims. Since then the situation has escalated, and people have died. Iran knows they can't ignore the issue any longer and must disclose this to the world. But they still haven't been testing, so they don't have accurate numbers.

just a couple of possibilities that are not so impossible imo.  


I live in Lithuania and this is anecdotal but in my local press there was this article about a man who flew back home from China and him and his family got pretty ill and had fever. Fearing that it might possibly be the new virus they tried to contact authorities for guidance but the first real response they got was 'there is no coronavirus in Lithuania' and the healthcare worker over the phone concluded that it is influenza they are most likely sick with and that was that. The man was later admitted to the hospital because his fever got worse and the article ended with a statement that he was tested negative for the new coronavirus.

Just shows that denial and willful blindness is a real element in all of this and many are going about their business thinking that it is a problem far far away in China so it  doesn't concern them. I really think that it is quite possible that people choose to believe the data from China and base their actions on that partly because they don't want to be the first one to take real action because that would mean more work on top of what they've got already just for the chance that the virus would come to where they are so better just go on and maybe somebody else will know what to do if comes to that."

First coronavirus patient in Santa Clara County released from isolation

 And, the couple from Northern California we’re discharged”in good health.” - see below as well:


The man was one of two people in Santa Clara County who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus. Two days later, county health officials confirmed a second, unrelated novel coronavirus infection in someone they described only as “an adult female” who had recently traveled to Wuhan and arrived Jan. 23 to visit family in the county.

Santa Clara County health officials have said she has stayed home since she arrived except for two occasions when she sought outpatient medical care. She was never sick enough to be hospitalized and also has been regularly monitored. She was still under isolation Thursday, Moles said.

Two other Northern California cases were confirmed Feb. 2 in San Benito County, a husband and wife both age 57. San Benito County health officials said the husband recently traveled from Wuhan, but his wife did not and was believed to have been infected through him. They were later transferred to the University of California San Francisco hospital for a higher level of care.

The San Francisco Department of Public Health said Friday the couple were discharged from UCSF “in good health,” but would not say whether they had fully recovered and been cleared to resume their normal lives. Shawn Merillat, a spokesman for San Benito County’s health department, said Thursday the agency had nothing to report on the couple’s condition

Five San Jose hospital workers were sent home as a precaution after they were exposed last month to the county’s first coronavirus case at Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose. They were cleared to work Feb. 12 after showing no symptoms over 14 days, health officials said.

Health officials are also monitoring 300 county residents who are healthy but face increased risk of acquiring the new coronavirus illness because they traveled in mainland China within the last two weeks, Dr. Sara Cody, county health director, said Wednesday. They have been told to “self-quarantine,” stay home, limit contact with others and report their health status to county authorities.

Moles said the department continues to work closely with healthcare providers, hospitals and others to monitor the novel coronavirus. Currently, she said, there is no evidence that the virus is circulating in Santa Clara County, and risk to the public remains low."

Also, just because a virus may have escaped from a lab, does not in any way indicate said virus was artificial. This fact even seems to escape the author of this article. The researchers there study natural viruses in bats - which the author acknowledges - and then in another breath she talks about how the scientific community has debunked the novel coronavirus as artificial. 

It now seems to be generally accepted that the virus came from bats (even if via an intermediary host animal). These bats are only found in their native Yunnan - 1000km away - or in the virus lab - 250m away from the wildlife market. Add Chinas’s shocking record with safety protocols (think the Tianjin explosion a few years ago) and it really isn’t hard to imagine a deadly virus escaping the lab at some point. Being a state-owned lab, it is exceedingly obvious that the CCP would rather die than admit its own lab was the cause, and much prefer to blame Chinese people for the outbreak. Hence their speed to rapidly identify the wildlife market as the cause, even though there was clearly insufficient evidence of this."

Additionally, unmanaged respiratory illnesses usually are a three month cycle in a location and they seldom start that cycle past mid spring. Note that very aggressive management of CV is happening. 

What this means is that within a month to a month and a half we will be out of the danger zone until November.  If there’s a substantial outbreak outside China in the next month that is a concern. But China may have bought the world the time it needed. 

We can see cv hit the Southern Hemisphere during our summer and come back later, but if it’s that bad, we will have solid countermeasures by then or early vaccine.

It will not be. Nobody else has canceled, and we're a week out from the conference. For most places that aren't Sony, the cost of booth space and materials is too big to simply cancel last minute.

What you *might* see more of is cases like this, where developers from China/Japan will not be coming, even if the company maintains its presence in general with its American staff. (Like with the Square Enix booth) This is because the coronavirus is becoming a thing in Japan, and the Japanese public have been warned against large gatherings and things like travel where you're on a plane of potentially infected people for fourteen hours. And many large Japanese corporations have simply instituted company-wide travel bans. But that won't affect a vast majority of companies that have a presence in PAX East, because very few developers fly here from Japan anyway.

OMAHA, Neb. - The CDC has verified the test results completed Monday by the Nebraska Public Health Lab on 13 individuals being held for coronavirus monitoring and care. Eleven of these individuals have tested positive for COVID-19, while two tested negative.

University of Nebraska Medical Center currently has ten people in the National Quarantine Unit while three are in the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit. Most people aren’t showing symptoms of the disease, however several others are exhibiting minor symptoms.

These 13 people are all former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were evacuated to the United States via two 747s February 17."

Or that Wuhanese wealthy enough to travel to Europe during CNY also have higher levels of hygiene and sanitation, and had less interaction at street level in the epicenter.  That would rationalize the exception to the rule with the English traveler who got sick at a French Alps ski resort. Sorta rationalizes why a low cost destination like Qom Iran did get hit too.

Alternatively, the coronavirus hit lower and middle income Wuhanese neighborhoods , people who would rarely if ever travel to Europe."

You're right to worry about crash, because they will happen. But your chances of beating the market is against you compare to if you just sat and ride through the crash. With the amount of money you claim you had, you should be buying more shares as the market crash, so when the market recover you'd be making insane return."

On top of that, if you look at the Nielsen data on Netflix, which has been verified to be pretty damn close to the internal metrics, 90% of Netflix's most watched shows are syndicated properties, many of which are Paramount/CBS Studios properties. It sounded like ViacomCBS was planning on not going exclusive for content, but they'll need to to get these OTT services off the ground. People are also overestimating streaming as being for young people only. If you look at the changing macros across the TV population, old people are surging in OTT growth and they watch CBS content like its candy. 

I bought about 5k for a long term play today at 29.49, the upside is there and its insulated from coronavirus, especially when you compare it to the other streamer players who have parks and much larger theatrical units that are heavily exposed.

They make up, without evidence, the fact that we are PROBABLY missing cases. Because it is IMPOSSIBLE that we are doing a better job than richer countries at controlling this disease.
> 
> Well, there is more to disease control than resources. Epidemiology is probably the number one thing, particularly how many sick people there are and how they transmit. And historically, it has happened that we had FEWER cases of disease than rich countries. For instance:

> MERS: South Korea - 186 Philippines - 2

Please stop disparaging your countrymen because of your own feelings of inferiority. If you don't like it here, maybe they'll appreciate you somewhere else.

Personally? I think we likely have a lot of missed cases already given how some carriers are asymptomatic. And it's not just us. Studies are estimating we're only able to confirm 30% of cases worldwide.

To add, SARS and MERS also happened before the large influx of Chinese happened in our country in the past few years so the opinion above may no lnger hold true. 

Do we have more cases tha SG, JP, HK, and TW? We don't know. And if ever there's a coverup happening, don't you think the medical professionals will say something about it? Healthcare isn't exactly a place where Duterte is well loved. 

It's not necessarily malice. We just might not really know. Not everybody sick goes to the hospital. 

Medyo naoff lang ako dun sa idea na rekta ke Duterte agad yung sisi. It's highly possible that he just doesn't know any better than you and me at this point. And not wanting him to say ""don't panic"" and ""Everything is under control"" doesn't make sense. You do not want people to panic. It helps nobody. 

And then you end your post something speculative and fear mongering

4 people have been transferred to Sacred Heart in Spokane, confirmed as having Coronavirus. The lady can't confirm if they're part of the CDC's official numbers, which is currently 15. So I did some looking into it...

15th person - went to press Feb 13th ""The patient arrived in Texas Feb. 7 from China and was quarantined at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. The patient has the first reported infection in the state, and is currently in isolation at a local hospital.""  
14th person - went to press Feb 12 ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the patient is one of the passengers who arrived on a State Department-chartered flight from Wuhan, China, to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego on Friday.""  
13th Person - went to press Feb 10 ""The adult patient is the 13th in the U.S., and was placed under quarantine at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego""  
12th person - went to press Feb 6th - in Wisconsin, so unlikely to be moved to Travis AFB.  
11th person - went to press Feb 3rd - Couple in San Benito.  

So... who are these 4 people? It doesn't add up that it's the last four CA people diagnosed, and surely cases prior to those are 'recovered' or whatever happens after 17 days. Am I missing something here? I feel like Sacred Heart just confirmed 4 more cases in the US."

>A religious group in South Korea has been identified as a coronavirus hotbed, officials say, amid a sharp rise in confirmed cases in the country.

>The infections among members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony (Shincheonji) are linked to one woman.

>The sect in the city of Daegu accounts for 30 of 53 new cases, with officials warning of an unprecedented crisis.

>South Korea also confirmed its first death from the virus, named Covid-19.

>The coronavirus, which originated in China's Hubei province, causes pneumonia-like symptoms.

>China has now seen 2,118 deaths and recorded nearly 75,000 infections.

>On Thursday, Japan said two of its passengers who contracted the coronavirus on board quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess had died. The man and the woman were in their 80s.

>South Korean health officials believe that the infections are linked to a 61-year-old woman who tested positive for the virus earlier this week.

>The Korean Centre for Disease Control says the woman - who has not been identified - had contact with 166 people, who were asked to self-quarantine.

>At least 30 of the new Covid-19 infections were on Thursday recorded among sect members in Daegu, a city of about 2.5 million people in the south-east.

>The Shincheonji, which has been accused of being a cult, said it had now shut down its Daegu branch and that services in other regions would be held online or individually at home.

>The mayor of the city has described the event as an ""unprecedented crisis"" and urged people in the city to stay indoors. Commanders on a nearby US military base also imposed access restrictions, news agency AFP reported."

The supervising was only supposed to go until 1am but it went until 2-something instead and the dogs were upset that the bedtime routine wasn’t normal. 

Maybe it’s the tiredness talking, but today I feel like maybe we really shouldn’t have kids. Like, I had previously always wanted them eventually, but maybe I wouldn’t be happy having kids; society is so critical of women/mothers, and it feels like I would have to do more of the emotional labour even though my job pays more. So maybe it’s good I’m not pregnant, and maybe it’s good that we’re probably out this cycle due to the kinds of bullshit circumstances we’ve been having this week (because there’s no way I’m going to wanna bang tonight either).

After the initial Wuhan outbreak, when cases were popping up all over the world, someone brought the virus to Iran. Since Iran is dealing with so much else at the moment -  political tension and instability, protests, inflation - testing for Coronavirus was not a top priority. 

So for the past few weeks, people with symptoms were ignored, or mistaken as flu victims. Since then the situation has escalated, and people have died. Iran knows they can't ignore the issue any longer and must disclose this to the world. But they still haven't been testing, so they don't have accurate numbers. All they know is a bunch of people are now sick and some are dying.

* Given the spherical morphology of the virion, can it bind ACE2 in almost any orientation?
* Does the relative abundance of these spike proteins present a challenge for antibody-mediated neutralization, antiviral activity, or vaccine development?
* Can the spike proteins be downregulated in response to host defense? Also, it would be interesting to see whether ACE2 is downregulated in host cells as a defense mechanism."

Disclaimer (sort of): This is an evil thought, and we already have an agreement that I’ll be the next candidate for a room in her condo. I just feel it’s unfair for her, but not sure if it’s my place to say those things. 

My friend owns a condo near my uni and it’s in a very nice neighborhood - close to everything especially school. The rent is more than reasonable too. We met at school and became close two years ago. During our hangout together she had complained to me before about her current tenant - they have some kind of a friendship but she doesn’t like a lot of things the tenant does, like leaving around dirty dishes for days, overflowing garbage and messy kitchen. She brought these issues up multiple times with this tenant but eventually stopped trying after seeing no change in her behavior whatsoever.  My friend’s boyfriend comes over and does the dishes for this tenant, and it’s almost like she realized this pattern and left dishes for him on purpose to clean. 

I’m in the middle of looking for a room to rent near campus right now. Although she expressed to me that I’d be the next person to move in if her place ever becomes available, I have a feeling that might happen sooner if I really try to convince her to evict the current tenant. I want to do this partly because I think she’s being taken advantage of, and partly because I really like her place. 

WIBTA if I do it? It’s a very shady move in my opinion. But what the tenant had done to me makes me not want to have mercy on her lol.

1,812 recent views

Welcome to this Science Matters on the Novel Coronavirus (COVID19) - a free course to learn about the science underpinning the outbreak response. On January 30th, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared an outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus, now officially referred to as COVID19. As the epidemic seems to spread to more and more countries, people around the world are wondering about the trajectory of the epidemic and whether they should be concerned. Media reports of the epidemic often focus on the more eye-catching events: governments evacuating their citizens from Hubei province, passengers on cruise ships being stopped from disembarking following a detection of a case, or images of supermarket supplies running out in areas perceived to be at high risk. On social media, other reports about the epidemic range from unsupported rumours to deliberate disinformation are increasing a sense of panic many individuals are experiencing. Robust, reliable analysis is vital at this stage not only as a way to give concerned members of the public a sense of perspective, but also to support governments and other stakeholders in planning their responses. Researchers at the MRC Centre of Global Infectious Diseases Analysis (GIDA) and the Jameel Institute for Disease Emergency Analytics (J-IDEA) have been working hard on coming up with reliable estimates of the spread of the epidemic and its prospects, and are doing this in close collaboration with a number of global stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation (WHO). You will hear directly from the experts conducting the analyses. You will be able learn about the current state of the epidemic, while also learn about the epidemiological and public-health principles and challenges that underpin these analyses. This will include understanding how the spread of the epidemic is modelled, how transmissibility of infections is estimated, what the challenges are in estimating the case fatality ratio, and also learning about the importance of community involvement in responding to the epidemic. If you want to learn more about infectious disease modelling, epidemiology, participatory approaches in public health, or health economics, a number of free MOOCs are available from Imperial College London. We also offer a fully online Global Master of Public Health for those of you who want to delve even deeper, as well as free online open courses.

Certainly not enough to warrant the panic you're trying to promote. 

The flu kills hundreds of thousands every year. Coronavirus killed about 800. It's a 2.3% mortality rate, a number which is contested because milder cases aren't being counted. 

Meanwhile, in America alone, more than 180,000 were hospitalised by, and 10,000 died from complications from the flu during the concurrent flu season.

One kills hundreds. One kills tens of thousands. Yet you're putting your money on the amateur. Bearimg in mind, we can actually treat the flu, yet it still killed multitudes more in the same period - using numbers from just one country.

Come at me with your hysteria, but you'll get smacked down like a little bitch by the facts."

You're having egregious load times despite having an SSD and being on PC, chances are either your internet is behaving strangely, or your hardware is.   


> That would be like if I said, I don't have the Coronavirus, so anyone that does have it, it's a you problem. Ignoring the fact that it's a widespread disease. 

...yeahhhh not really. It becomes a world problem but the thing is your situation is peculiar. If you were on console then that speaks to the bigger issue of load times that those players are always hit with, but everything about your setup shouldn't result in the issues you are facing *therefore making it a you problem.* Not everything can just be ""wow Bungo it's all your fault."" I'm not just basing it off my own experience but the relative experience of PC players to console players when it comes to load times and then with your *hyper-specific issue of character load times* as opposed to the main issue of tower load times. Come on dude.

It's absolutely entirely possible that out of these billions of people on this earth there are multiple people facing the same issue, but when that ratio of people who have SSDs and PC's and are complaining about *character load times* are so clearly in the one percent - is it really as bad an issue as the rest of the things plaguing the game worth my imminent concern for you? lol I try to be fair as much as I can but this is absurd."

Very young children and old people generally have either immature or compromised immune systems, respectively, and thus are at heightened risk from illnesses like influenza.  That old people are dying in droves and young people aren't means either we have bad data, or there is a pathological difference in the way the disease is causing damage in elderly patients but isn't in younger patients.

One theory I've read is antibody dependent enhancement.  Sort of like exposure to one type of dengue fever in an earlier event can make subsequent exposure to a second type of dengue fever a fatal event, whereas first time exposure to dengue is almost never fatal.  This happens because of antibody dependent enhancement.  The antibodies you developed earlier end up being a transport mechanism for the virus to infect more cells.  

Coronavirus causes a lot of colds.  Could be that the older you are, the higher probability that you have exactly the wrong antibodies which exacerbate your body's responses."

> By John Geddie and Aradhana Aravindan

> SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A day after Jeanhee Kim learned of a coronavirus case in her Singapore apartment block, she was visited by a distinguished-looking man she later learned was a senior government minister.

> Kim, a 51-year old American who had just relocated to the island as the outbreak began, said the man had asked her how her family were feeling, gave her some surgical masks and reassured her that Singapore was on top of the situation.

> Her experience exemplifies the fastidious approach taken to combat the outbreak in the city-state - which has included using police investigators and security cameras to help track and quarantine more than 2,500 people, and won international praise.

> ""Singapore is leaving no stone unturned,"" World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week.

> But experts say Singapore's virus-fighting playbook cannot be easily copied in other countries that lack its geographic attributes, financial clout and wide-ranging state controls.

> ""If Singapore can't contain it, I don't see any country that can,"" said Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota.

> 

> INTRUSIVE

> The densely packed island of 5.7 million has 84 coronavirus cases, the highest number outside mainland China, if the hundreds of infections on a cruise ship docked near Tokyo are excluded from Japan's count.

> But experts say Singapore's high tally says more about its ability to detect the disease.

> A recent study by Harvard University's Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics estimates Singapore is picking up three times more cases than other countries due to its disease surveillance and contact-tracing capacity.

> Size also matters - Singapore has less than a tenth the land area of the Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus first surfaced late last year and around half its population, making containment easier.

> As a sovereign state that has been ruled by the same party since independence in 1965, it also maintains tight control over the movement of people into and out of the city and has strict laws to keep potential virus-spreaders in line.

> When the first cases of infected Chinese visitors to Singapore surfaced in late January, a 140-strong team of government contact tracers set to work interviewing patients and identifying and quarantining those close to them.

> A close contact is defined as anyone who has been within two metres and spent 30 minutes with an infected patient.

> Finding these contacts has involved asking airlines to hand over flight manifests, tracking patients' movements on security cameras and roping in police investigators for the search, health ministry officials said.

> To date, Singapore has quarantined nearly 2,593 people.

> ""There is an acceptance of that intrusiveness in Singapore,"" said Chong Ja Ian, political science professor at the National University of Singapore. ""The public response to these sort of demands tends to be quite ready, so that helps with the ability to trace.""

> It is an offence for individuals to withhold or provide inaccurate information to a contact tracing officer. Moreover, people who breach quarantine orders can be fined up to S$10,000 ($7,137.76), jailed for up to six months, or both.

> Authorities have also enforced 14-day confinement of workers who have recently travelled to China, with more than 1,000 calls and visits made a day to ensure compliance. Breaches have seen work passes revoked and employers lose their rights to hire foreigners.

> In other measures, nearly 400,000 people have signed up to a government WhatsApp service that sends daily virus-related alerts on case numbers, disease prevention and warnings about internet rumours.

> 

> DEEP POCKETS

> Singapore's decisive response draws to some extent from its experience with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003-2004, which led to over 30 fatalities on the island, one of the highest counts outside mainland China.

> The country was one of the first to ban Chinese travellers earlier this month, a move that came at significant economic cost to the global transit hub, which counts China as its largest trade partner and biggest source of tourists.

> The prime minister has already warned the outbreak could tip its fragile economy into recession.

1. The post itself (which has a lot of merit and certainly provokes worthwhile discussion)
2. The applying of a rule in r/coronavirus against “speculation.”

1. Regarding the post, it’s fascinating and certainly worthwhile to compare the ‘17-‘18 flu season with this outbreak. In the spirit of deriving knowledge through discussion, I’ll put forth a critique. Your accounting of the first five weeks of COVID-19 appear the be the past five weeks, not the first five weeks following the virus’ emergence. Many of the latest estimates claim that the virus first emerged as early as October or possibly even September. Of course, we don’t have data going back that early. I’m curious to know how the earliest flu cases of the season are recorded, and when. Perhaps your first five weeks comparisons are more equivalent than I am giving them credit, but without more information we don’t know for sure. Would be worth looking into as no doubt we can find out answers to those questions and potentially get a more accurate comparison. 

Regardless, the peak five weeks comparison is particularly interesting. There have been numerous academic papers as well as experts in virology and epidemics that suggest the spread of this virus is far from peaking on a global scale, and it is widely understood now that the official numbers reflect a fraction of the true numbers. How does this ratio compare to that of recorded flu cases and the true number of flu infections? Again, worth looking further into.

Overall, a very interesting post that deserves my upvote.

2. Regarding the rule against speculation, I take issue with the rule’s application here as well as the rule itself. Considering the evidence currently available, the speculative aspect of the post was a reasonably deduced conclusion assuming the methodology utilized to derive the original numbers was sound (see my above comments regarding the “first five weeks”). Regardless, the post has strong merits and serves as a starting point for numerous worthwhile discussions. I have demonstrated this with my above comments. 

The rule against speculation itself is flawed and should be thrown out. The many reports from credible organizations, universities and researchers, reports which have been widely shared without issue (as they should be) in r/coronavirus present conclusions that are undeniably speculative in nature. The virus infecting 60% of the world, the possibility of it becoming endemic, the potential global economic consequences - all these things are similarly speculative, yet they are topics worthy of sharing and discussing. They are worth discussing and sharing because people, all people, must make decisions based on their anticipations of future events. This rule against speculation is vague and impossible to apply in a fair, objective, or even useful sense. The last thing rules in r/coronavirus should do is inhibit worthwhile and inevitable discussions."

*By Karen Weise and Michael Corkery
Feb. 20, 2020, 5:00 a.m. ET*

SEATTLE — What if the Everything Store couldn’t sell everything because of disruptions from the coronavirus?

That’s the situation that Amazon — which typically stocks more than 100 million items, from toilet paper to yoga pants — is working to avoid as the deadly outbreak continues to shut down and slow factories in China that produce the world’s goods.

Over the past few weeks, Amazon has responded to the crisis by making larger and more frequent orders of Chinese-made products that had already been shipped to the United States, according to company emails and consultants who work with major brands. Some of its suppliers have cut back on advertising and promotions on the site so they don’t run out of products too quickly.

Amazon also sent an urgent email to brands on Wednesday about Prime Day, its midsummer mega sale, indicating that it has begun worrying about inventory for the event. And the company has contacted some of its third-party merchants, whose dog leashes, crayons and other products account for about 60 percent of its sales, to figure out how their flow of goods might be impeded.

“Hello!” read one recent email from Amazon to a seller, which The New York Times reviewed. “We have identified that part of your supply chain process might be China dependent and in light of the coronavirus outbreak effecting manufacturing and logistics in China, we are reaching out to you to understand its impact on your business operations.”

With its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, Amazon is turning into a case study of how a giant retailer grapples with the fallout from the coronavirus and what may lie ahead for other stores. Already dozens of companies have indicated that the virus will take a toll on them, with Apple cutting its sales expectations this week and airlines canceling flights to China.

Retailers have so far said less about how the coronavirus will affect them. On Tuesday, Walmart said sales at its 430 stores in China had not faltered and added that the impact on its supply chain was unclear but might be more muted than at other companies.

Last year’s trade war with China may inadvertently be helping some big retailers now. At the time, companies imported more goods than usual from China to get ahead of expected tariffs. Some moved manufacturing to Vietnam and other Asian countries. When the new tariffs never took effect, retailers were left with more supply and more sourcing from other countries already in place.

Still, if China Inc. continues to be fitful beyond the next few weeks, major stores could run out of everyday products like sponges, print cartridges and construction paper by mid-April, according to a report from Wells Fargo last week. China is the largest source of imported consumer goods.

“We believe the time to start worrying about the supply chain risk” of the virus “is here,” the report said.

Amazon is likely to feel potential shortages of goods earlier than its American peers because it usually keeps fewer items on hand than they do. In good times, that lets the internet company run more efficiently because it does not tie up money to buy and store products that are waiting to be sold.

But that approach, called “lean inventory,” exposes Amazon more to shocks.

“This is a cost to pay for the efficiency that a just-in-time supply chain gets you,” said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee and the founder of CommerceIQ, a start-up whose automation tools are used by major brands including Kimberly-Clark and Logitech.
Some supply problems may be hidden. Even products made in America can rely on Chinese suppliers, which may cause problems down the line. Ketchup made in a plant in Sacramento, for example, may depend on tomato paste or bottles and caps from China.

Amazon faces an additional wrinkle in keeping its virtual shelves stocked: While traditional retailers generally control their inventory directly, most of the products on Amazon are bought and sold by third-party merchants. Amazon simply facilitates those sales, giving it less visibility into supply.

“Out of an abundance of caution, we are working with suppliers to secure additional inventory to ensure we maintain our selection for customers,” an Amazon spokeswoman said. The company later added, “We are monitoring developments related to the coronavirus and taking appropriate steps as needed.”

Amazon’s algorithms have now asked for six to eight weeks of supply on products made in China instead of just two or three weeks, said Mr. Hariharan, who discussed the changes with large brands that supply the retailer.
Amazon has also made larger and more frequent buys, deviating from its regular cadence of automated purchases, according to company emails and consultants.

“Amazon issued off-cycle orders to you last night in order to prepare for possible supply chain disruptions due to recent global events originating in China,” one recent email to a vendor read. Similar emails were earlier reported by Business Insider.

Fahim Naim, who managed inventory at Amazon and now advises brands selling there, said it had placed extra orders from his clients who have more than $10 million in annual sales on the site and had marked “China” as the source of their products. Amazon’s emails to his clients show that it is giving brands extra time to get their products to its warehouses without a penalty.

On Feb. 7, the main Amazon website that sellers use to run their business posted a message that included tips for making sure Amazon’s algorithms didn’t ding their accounts if they couldn’t fulfill orders.

Jerry Kavesh, who offers Western wear like $85 cowboy boots on Amazon, is emblematic of the supply issues that its sellers face.
Mr. Kavesh, 57, who is based in a Seattle suburb, said that the factory in China that produced his cowboy hats was closed and that he did not know when it would reopen. Even after the factory’s workers return, the facility needs wool from its Chinese suppliers to make the hats.

“The key component — they don’t know when they are going to get that,” he said.
It takes about four months for his orders to be made and to arrive in the United States, Mr. Kavesh added. That means he typically would have products already in process for Prime Day, Amazon’s two-day shopping deal extravaganza, which usually falls in early July.
Amazon appears to share the concern. On Wednesday, it sent an email to a beauty supplies brand asking whether it expected to have enough of its top five products this summer.

“Amazon is trying to establish an inventory risk for your business moving forward and specifically for Prime Day,” said the email, which The Times reviewed. “We appreciate your feedback by TODAY.”

Mr. Naim said some brands he worked with had pulled back on their ads on Amazon by 25 percent to 50 percent, and had stopped promotions they had planned, to preserve money and inventory. Other sellers said they were contemplating whether to raise prices to prevent — or at least delay — running out of stock.

Eddie Levine, who has been selling on Amazon since 2012, shipped more than 130 containers of toys, housewares and other goods from China last year, largely to offer on the site. He has cautioned the brands he works with against raising prices, saying that if a $20 product suddenly costs $40, “the last thing you want is a bad review saying it’s not worth $40.”

But if the virus disruptions persist into late spring or early summer, “people will have to raise prices without even having the option because there is just no stock,” Mr. Levine said. “That’s pure supply and demand.”"

China is trying to paint a rosier picture, but I'm not sure I believe them.

WHO also said that - with a mortality rate of around two percent, COVID-19 was ""less deadly"" than other Coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
WHO officials rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted to avoid risking a new nest of infection like the one on the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess off Japan.

You already answered it. **Time.** Time is the single currency everyone has the same amount of and once spent is never able to be gotten back.  Also when you say ""they"" who are you talking about? If your story about being a new interest study is true, in your innocence you will be referring to the people in your local congregation when you say ""they"". I suggest you start thinking about ""they"" as the organization instead and not the people at the local level. The locals are duped by the indoctrination already. They already ""believe"".

*""They spare their own time and effort for helping others. ""*

As above. Duped believers. Also, do they really ""help others""? Or do they only help others that are also JWs? I sat at the International Convention last year and listened to a talk about helping others. The \_entire talk\_ was about helping others **\[who are Jehovah's Witnesses\]**. I sat there and really wanted to hear the speaker say to help just anyone in need but it never came out. So they help others? Yes, but no. Like I said. Observe, listen, learn. Don't look through rose coloured glasses.

*""if you don’t agree with something they encourage you to do research and look for more information""*

**Take note of where they encourage you to ""research"" from.** Their own publications. This is a classic cult move, and yes, it's the lovely local JWs telling you to do this. Duped indoctrinated believers. They're lovely and nice, but also duped and indoctrinated. I should know - I'm technically still one.

*""If they don’t know the answers to the topic they’ll say, ‘I don’t know.’ But they’ll try their best to find the answer. If they know the answer, then they let you know. Seems honest to me.""*

The problem is not that they admit they don't know an answer for something. It's what they do (because they are indoctrinated and have been trained to do it) when they find reliable information that is counter to things that they already believe. **They employ ignorance.** It's ok to say ""i don't know"" as an answer. You can always intake \_more information\_ to gain \_better understanding\_ on a topic. But what happens if you unwittingly shut out information from reliable sources because you have been trained to do so? They are being ignorant. We live in the information age. Information is literally at our fingertips. **There's no excuse for shutting out information.** When the lovely local (duped indoctrinated) JWs get to this point, they say things like ""we just have to wait on Jehovah"" or ""an answer wasn't included in the Bible so we can't judge"". They may as well say ""let's just ignore that"".

*""Some prophecies that I see relating to our time: Ruining Of the earth(Global Warming, could also mean nuclear war although it has not occurred but maybe possible) Diseases(Coronavirus) The whole world will have a chance to learn about the bible(JWs is a large organization by now and has translated the Bible in thousands of languages)""*

Ruining of the earth - See this prophecy is so vague that even you yourself are sitting here saying, ""maybe its this, or it could be that, perhaps its this other thing"". **If a prophecy is vague then it isn't a prophecy.** It's a vague prediction that will fit umpteen number of things so to a lovely local (duped indoctrinated) it will always look like it fits. Most prophetic texts are written in this style deliberately. To make the reader think that it applies to their time but guess what? It applies in everyone's time!

Diseases - it's common knowledge that regular influenza kills more people than corona virus has at this point. **Don't be sucked in by media hype and/or the lovely local (do you get what I mean when I say that?) JWs internal fear mechanisms triggering knee-jerk responses about the world coming to an end when they see news stories that fit their confirmation bias.** The lovely locals have been doing this since before 1975.

The whole world getting a chance to learn about the bible. Despite the fact that it's impossible for literally everyone in the world to get a chance to learn about the bible before Jehovah decides to pull the plug on a few billion humans, I'll choose to focus on another point I dislike about this prophecy. **WT org decided to make this their number 1 rung on the ladder for being a Christian and God's chosen people on earth in the 20th century** (and now 21st, oops sorry guys it was meant to come before then! Look! An overlapping generation and a carrot on a stick!) WT swing this idea about preaching to the whole earth around to the lovely local JWs as its trump card. WT are the ones that are fulfilling the prophecy so they must be the chosen religion. Do you see any other religion swinging that scripture around as a credential for being a Christian religion? No where near as much as WT. Why? Because those other religions haven't made that single thing their number one rung on the Christian ladder (nor do they use it to claim they are God's chosen religion) The lovely local JWs will harp on about this point, and it's fair to say that what WT has achieved because of the drive to ""fulfill"" this scripture is amazing such as their translation works. However what never really is consider is the innumerable unpaid hours that lovely local JWs sacrifice for this to happen. Literal lifetimes of people's time. If preaching is the number 1 thing about Jehovah's organization on earth, why does the JW religion not grow in size compared to other Christian religions? SDAs have WAY more adherants (25 million) than JWs (8 million) despite beginning at practically the same time (1863 vs 1870). All that preaching for not much in return. Does that sound like Jehovah's spirit is blessing the preaching work?

**TLDR:**

So here's what I'd like you to consider:

Do you want to spend a lot of time on something where you are asked to believe things first, and be limited on where you can learn about things from? 

Do you want to have to employ ignorance to maintain your worldview? 

Do you want to live in fear on a moth-to-month basis as you watch the daily news all while spending your time for an organization that claims to be achieving great things through God's blessing but never acknowledges the hard work and endless time that the lovely local JWs sacrifice to it?

If yes, keep ""studying"" and block out the rest of the world around you. That's exactly what the duped indoctrinated JWs will tell you."

You can see them consciously addressing issues based upon crisis risk communications principles...at the CDC level... But, have you heard anything since? It is unusually quiet. The only person out there I've seen is Fauci with the NIH. And he spoke on CNBC and never mentioned CDC in 15 minutes.  He was answering questions CDC should have been asking.  He is good and would not intentionally be dissonant, but they usually have a coordinated approach with common messaging points, always pointing back to CDC and their websites.  There seems to be some discombobulation...  They should be doing more updates, in person, keeping and eye on things and when they see the patterns and questions that are rising to the top addressing them almost daily...  

Wait...
While writing this, I just decided to see what CDC is doing and found this article https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-americans/2020/02/20/b6f54cae-5279-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.htm 

Now, I know what is going on. CDC is fighting the administration and losing...  They did not want the people to come home from the ship. They were afraid of just exactly what happened with 14 people being found to be infected during the flight.  That explains it.  They refused to have their name on the press releases.  I had noticed that.  This is NOT good from an integrated coordinated messaging approach. Well, perhaps since CDC was right, the Administration and other departments will back off. I've seen that happen before. During H1N1, I was in Kansas and when we had our first case that was one of the first 10 cases in the country, the General in charge of the National Guard took over EVEN THOUGH the state plan said public health would be the lead. They ignored public health and the state plan and started doing messaging with public health telling them they were fucking up and why and what was going to happen and sure enough, (I was on the communications team) they put out a press release that caused the public the go nuts along and followed up with one that made it worse...because they do not get it...  They TOLD people what they were going to do and did not try to anticipate the reactions and carefully address concerns. Somebody got to the Governor and showed what had happened including the predicted outcome and voila, he put public health back in charge and things calmed down...

The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22–25°C and relative humidity of 40–50%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (>3 log10) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38°C, and relative humidity of >95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments.""

I think coronavirus virus absolutely fits into this category. If you flew to China once a month from Jan to Dec 2019, then couldn't at all in 2020... It's very obvious that coronavirus is the reason.

Abstract

COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province since December 2019, and caused a rapid outbreak throughout China and globally. Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS. We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene. Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. 

*Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 exists and should be acknowledged. Repeated sampling, change of specimen type or metagenomics sequencing could further facilitate during critical clinical cases.*

Iranian officials said Thursday that three people had been newly-infected with the coronavirus, just a day after they had announced that two others had died in the Iranian city of Qom. According to Iranian media, nine deaths in total have occurred there. 

“Cargo ships coming to Iraqi ports in Basra governorate are dealt with in accordance to international health regulations set by World Health Organization (WHO) in 2006 to prevent the spread of epidemic on an international level,” a Health Ministry statement explained.

Thursday's statement about Iraqi border crossings continued by explaining that the ministry “has also been informed of the necessity of providing additional health checkpoints to support the border-crossing health stations.”
Governors of both Basra and Maysan provinces have blocked Iranians from entering through official border-crossings and Wasit's governor called upon Baghdad to halt any and all movement through its border with Iran, furthermore.

A statement from Iraq’s Ministry of Health also recommended the complete closure of all border crossings and movement with Iran, with the exception of diplomatic delegations provided they go through a medical inspection due to fears of the coronavirus.  "

They’d be mightily offended if someone suggested they go the straightforward route and *hire* a rent boy, but will spends tens of thousands on airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals and driving 20 hours straight through to East Gnat’s Ass in diapers through 9 tolls to meet an effective stranger and get jiggy-jiggy. (Nelt-sun couldn’t bring himself to feign passion on camera - before the inevitable closing door, but Dinyell was all ready to salivate, fog up her Coke bottle glasses and strip down to her almost-predictably mismatched and threadbare rayon underwear, but wanted it preserved for posterity, filmed by TLC?  Nelt-sun had big cash stars in his eyes for what is readily available on the Nat’l Geo channel for free? Really?)

I imagine the, umm, finer of the upper echelons of the Rent-a-Hot-Toy-Boys would be out of Dinyell’s budget (and they do, after all, have some say in the matter of which clients they accept).  Dinyell **demands** the fantasy that she is, truly, bringing a lot to the table, and the real kicker is that it is all “real”.  Though she has given every appearance (including her own words) that she couldn’t catch the coronavirus in her own “pond”, she somehow believes that foreign DNA especially makes personal standards plummet and allows for a lot of latitude regarding expectations of... well, to be kind, lots of things, but certainly including basic sanity.  She is willing to go through all the delusions that she is somehow so special, so rare a total package, that instead of it being the usual case of “water seeking its own level”, that she’ll be the middle-aged (diplomatically said) starling that entrances the in-his-prime peacock.

When the expected happens (and happens again and again) she see-saws between rage and piteous weeping.  Sure, everyone wants to be loved.  However, she’s like the types who believe they’re getting special messages from their favourite rock star (or even newscaster or dentist) because of the shirt he’s wearing.  (One can almost hear her say, eyes too-shiny and enervatingly glittering, that she knew Mahmit was THE One when she saw he was wearing an orange shirt in his online pictures; it was a message, just for her, that he was passionate about Eau de Poisson de la Veille et Chou. 😳) 

TLC may be totally guilty of scripting (or, just as likely, “arranging”) all sorts of situations, but Dinyell was quite the picture, all on her own, from the get-go, clinging to Mahmint’s bicep like kudzu. In the beginning, as she clung and smiled, he looked shell-shocked, like “how did I get here, and with *her*?”  (Don’t get me wrong; no sympathy here.  You indulge in fraud for ulterior gain, and use someone else, no tears for you when it ends up costing you far more, on many levels, than simply going the straightforward, legal route.)

Until the bottom predictably fell out (for *her*; for all his attempts to steel himself and gut it out, Mahmint’s eyes-on-the-prize zeal plummeted at the airport) he was unable to maintain even affability until the situation demanded he ooze molasses-sticky insincere sweetness and assurances to quell Dinyell’s hysteria and threats to end his own fantasy agenda.

“Hiring a fantasy”, even that such arrangements routinely involve their own fantasies, would negate her most-prized fantasy: that her “romantic” relationships are real.  She wouldn’t have that invaluable “citizenship card” to play if she’d restricted her choices to other Americans (but she might be able to swing some crossover-TLC show action by dating a convicted felon and appearing on “Love And/After Lock-Up.  Some possible Reality TV gold might be mined, there! 🤩)

It’s incredibly expense to “purchase” someone’s 24/7/365 time and attention.  Dinyell believed a green card and American citizenship could do that.  She got far less than what she might have negotiated if she’d chosen the “business” route."

Due to the novel  coronavirus outbreak, the Ministry of Health (MoH) has suspended flights  to the provinces of Hubei, Zhejiang and Jiangsu in the People’s  Republic of China, in addition to reducing the number of flights to Hong  Kong and Taipei.

With local authorities  issuing travel bans and suspensions of flights, especially from mainland  China, the Brunei travel sector is bracing itself for the impact of the  global pandemic.

China is the largest source  of overseas travel to the Sultanate, followed by other Far East markets  in South Korea and Japan. According to Brunei’s Tourism Development  Department, China is the top source market for tourist arrivals to  Brunei, with a record number of 43,000 arrivals from January to July in  2019.

Their absence is keenly felt by the local hoteliers and tour operators that thrived under their patronage.

A hotel in Jerudong is now facing an 80 per  cent drop in occupancy rates, due to cancellations of bookings from  Chinese tour groups since the travel advisories were announced.

“Most cancellations are  from the (Chinese) tour groups and also a few cancellations from our  online booking platform (agoda, booking.com),” said the hotel manager.

 

In view of this, the hotel  has dropped room rates for online bookings by 20 per cent, until further  notice. They are now trying to attract local clients by providing  special discounts.

Tour operator Lesly said he  is lucky to not have focussed exclusively on tourists from China. “But  some of my friends did, and they are really suffering due to the onset  of the coronavirus and the cancellation of tourist arrivals from China,”  he said.

Lesly added that he can  still survive, as the majority of his clients are from English-speaking  countries (United Kingdom and Australia) and other Asian cities.

“However, during Chinese New Year, all my guests (from mainland China) automatically cancelled their bookings,” he said.

A representative from an established travel agency located in Bandar Seri Begawan also told the *Bulletin* that business has been “very much affected” since the coronavirus outbreak.

“We were supposed to have a  group (from Brunei) leaving for mainland China, but all flights were  cancelled,” she said. “We are now working with the airline authorities  to either change flight dates or provide full refunds to our customers.”

Some cruise ships from Singapore to Brunei were also cancelled as a precaution.

Tour bus operators which often brought Chinese tourists on sightseeing rounds are also impacted by the current situation.

As of Wednesday, China’s  Health Commission reported 74,185 infections. It also mentioned that the  global death toll from the virus is at 2,009 so far, but at least 4,200  people have made recoveries.

Governments around the world have issued travel advisories and started to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, Hubei Province.

The Chinese authorities have also shut down  travel into and out of Wuhan, and enacted similar strict transport  restrictions in a number of other cities."

Earlier article said state of the art Box containment units were installed on one of the  evac airplanes: 

“The press release did not offer any details about this ""specialized containment area,"" but pictures from the evacuation show a Containerized Bio-Containment System (CBCS) installed on one of the aircraft.”

[source](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/32248/747s-carrying-americans-exposed-to-coronavirus-used-new-quarantine-box-for-infected-flyers) 

But this article has the following statement (and suggests much less modern protection than CBCS quarantine box and if they had used CBCS surely it would have been discussed in Washington post article): 

“”Officials had already prepared the plane to handle passengers who might develop symptoms on the long flight, he argued. The two Boeing 747s had 18 seats cordoned off with 10-foot-high plastic on all four sides. “

Seats with plastic.  Not an installed bill gates built state of the art containment unit."

Now there are concerns about the accuracy of the laboratory tests used to confirm diagnoses.

Reports suggest some people test negative up to six times even though they are infected with the virus, according to the BBC and Chinese media. Such was the case with Dr. Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist who first identified the outbreak and was reprimanded by Chinese authorities when he tried to warn others.

Dr. Wenliang developed a cough and fever after unknowingly treating an infected patient. He was hospitalized, testing negative for coronavirus several times before eventually receiving a positive result. On Jan. 30 the doctor posted: ""Today nucleic acid testing came back with a positive result, the dust has settled, finally diagnosed,"" according to the BBC. Dr. Wenliang passed away on February 7 in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.

False-negative test results, where patients are told they do not have a condition when they actually do, cause several problems. Patients may be turned away from hospitals and medical facilities when they require care. They may infect others at home, work, school, or in the community. Patients' conditions may also worsen without treatment.

Q: Am I at risk for COVID-19 from a package or products shipping from China?

A: There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website as it becomes available."

The modern warm period is no different than the Minoan, Roman and Medieval warm period -- and the modern warm period began before there was any significant increase in CO2.   


I get that you have been trained to think Carbon Dioxide is some kind of death gas - but its actual impact on the climate is logarithmic and miniscule.  The upper bound for the Charney sensitivity is about 1C per doubling -- which means we could burn every bit of recoverable fossil fuel and STILL not be able to reach the temperatures of the Holocene Thermal Maximum ( When civilization began ).    


The reality is that this modern warming is part of a larger scale oscillation between warming and cooling that has been happening roughly every thousand years since the height of the thermal maximum.  CO2 likely has no real impact.    


It's certainly not something directly measurable.  Even the absorption spectrum is overlapped by water vapor in nearly all frequency ranges. If there is any water in the atmosphere that makes it virtually opaque compared to CO2.    


I get that you have faith but the same people that are lying to you about things like the Coronavirus - pushing preposterous propaganda to shape narrative --- are the people that are pushing the Gretas of the world to sell climate change hoax.  It's a game.  And you can tell which one they really fear --- the one they are trying to downplay."

2020-02-20,Creative_Dream,investing,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f6z0dr/norwegian_cruise_lines/fi99xzm/,"I am long Carnival. At this time, I don't think NCLH is a bargain; this is just a small discount. I do think Carnival is cheap, but there is a lot of uncertainties and I do think it can go a bit lower. I'd wait, unless you believe in NCLH long-term.

Obviously the virus has been tough on all three: Carnival, Royal and Norwegian.

Between the three, NCLH supposedly has the least exposure to China and RCL the most. But this affects all travel in general, not just the Chinese tourists (and Chinese tourists often will fly to foreign countries then cruise from there), so NCLH isn't immune. And NCLH has expensive cruises, and rich Chinese tourists aren't going to be cruising this year. So they will be hit; not sure what the market was thinking believe Norwegian would be better off than the other two.

As for valuation, before coronavirus, obviously CCL was the cheapest of three by a significant amount, but its growth was and expected to be slower and margin has been lower than RCL or NCLH. RCL I believe was the most expensive, then NCLH closely behind - probably still the case. At the time, I didn't think NCLH was a bargain; just fairly valued. I thought CCL was cheap and bought in prior to their decent quarterly result, quickly yielding +15% return. Then, the virus hit and wiped out my gains. At this point, there is a lot of uncertainties, but the discounts have been fairly mild (just eyeballing, I'd say only about 15% since November). Obviously, Carnival had the most headline and I'd say is down over 20% in the time frame from the absolute failure of a quarantine from the Japanese government turning the Diamond Princess into a death trap.

I think the virus will have a very large impact on cruising this year. We will have to wait and see what happens, but it can likely affect bookings for the next year as well. And it will likely take a slight ding on the balance sheet for all three, and while I'm not sure, this may even affect new ship delivery - growth has been a bigger component of valuation for RCL and NCLH, so I'd give that a thought too. I wouldn't be surprised if margins and occupancy are hit fairly substantially, and ships are moved around or suffer more downtime.

Generally, RCL is more driven by the Caribbean cruises (now with their private island Cococay) = tropical weather risk. The industry is overall very capital intensive and certainly doesn't have crazy growth or cheap growth, and I get a bit skeptical when the management only sees strong margin and new ship deliveries; on the other hand, RCL has really executed well. I think Carnival's brands are fairly strong and carry a lot of weight, moreso than the valuations imply. And the strong balance sheet and good value proposition to customers are important in this industry, particularly if the economy softens."

These guys find it to be closest to a cov found in pangolins 

>  Genomic analyses of nCoV-2019 determined a 96% resemblance with a coronavirus isolated from a bat in 2013 (RaTG13); however, the receptor
binding motif (RBM) of these two genomes share low sequence similarity. This divergence suggests a possible alternative source for the RBM coding sequence in nCoV-2019. We identified high sequence similarity in the RBM between nCoV-2019 and a coronavirus genome reconstructed from a viral
metagenomic dataset from pangolins possibly indicating a more complex origin for nCoV-2019.  https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.939207v1.full.pdf


So either a frankenvirus, or some yet unknown recombination history with pangolins. 

I can see how pangolins might get exposed to a bat cov, but not really the other way around. 

Whether a bat cov like sars2 or ratg13 could reproduce in a pangolin (which then exposes a human due to savage wet markets) would kind of surprise me. 

i think the frankenvirus theory is much more likely; still time to watch and see where the chips fall as researchers do their thing."

2. We're still only able to really have very rough estimates of the CFR. The report itself lists very large ranges for all of its findings due to this. The CI for this figure is 0.5-4%. That range is very large. Could it be lower than 1%? Yes, and let's hope to high hell it is. Maybe all the serious cases go to hospital, and maybe that's why the CFR looks so high right now (that said, I doubt that highly, esp. in Hubei where many cannot be seen at hospital due to the system being completely overwhelmed). Could it be much *higher* than 1%. Yes, and this remains to be seen. Recall that [SARS' CFR was revised way, way upwards when all was said and done](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward). See also: many very ill people cannot be seen at hospital, and instead are dying at home. Even [famous people like this film director and his whole family](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/18/coronavirus-kills-chinese-film-director-family-wuhan-covid-19) are dying at home. FWIW an event like that is *extremely* unlikely to have happened with a CFR of 2%, and still somewhat unlikely with a CFR of 18%. 

3. This report found that the CFR within Hubei is 18% with a gigantic CI of 11%-81%. One reason for this may be that the more severe cases are most likely to be recorded in a clinical setting. However, another reason for this may be that the CFR rises sharply after medical systems are overwhelmed. China didn't build two new hospitals in a week for funsies. They did this because the caseload collapsed the medical infrastructure. 

One can expect the CFR to change over time and between various places, based on variable conditions. If it comes to the west in large enough numbers to crash our medical systems, the CFR will go up. Barely any western country has the capacity to deal with this if the worst case projections of 60-80% of the population getting infected with 20% of those needing intensive care.

Spokane, Wash. - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has asked Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center to monitor and care for five individuals who have tested positive for the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Providence will work closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) and Spokane Regional Health District (SRHD) to care for these patients while they are under isolation. The exact timeline for the patient transfer is not yet known, but it is expected to occur within the next 1-2 days.  

Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center was selected because of its secured airborne infection isolation rooms, a specialized unit within the hospital. Providence is one of 10 hospitals in the country with this specialized treatment center. Regular hospital operations will not be impacted.  

Dr. Bob Lutz, Spokane County Health Officer with SRHD, explained the process of transporting patients with infectious diseases has been well practiced between local partner agencies.  

“We are coordinating with local partners to safely transport these patients to Sacred Heart,” Lutz said. “This is all being done following our jointly developed infectious disease protocols that we train and prepare for. The risk to the public from this novel coronavirus remains low.” "

A myriad of factors, potential growth (big if tariffs start applying to EU made cars), relative economy of scale from consolidating operations, access to human capital, government incentives, etc...

> Not to mention the disruption in the supply chain in terms of customs and tariffs.

Business will readjust. You seem to act like nobody can manufacture cars without being in the single market, a huge amount of goods flow across the Canada-US border where there is a customs barrier. Auto-manufacturing in the US, Japan and (yes) Europe, have supply chains that stretch back to China, its not a major impediment to production.

> As for 20% of the UK market - not a chance with the shite cars Nissan makes.

Depends on what sort of competitive edge they can get. Ambitious, sure. 

People often fail to appreciate just what a sorry state the German auto sector is in. They produce less cars now than at any other point in the past 22 years. Even at the bottom of the financial crisis, Germany was producing more cars than they do today. Their industry has been in a recession for the past 18 months, and there is absolutely no sign of any recover. The hit to Chinese activity from the coronavirus is going to continue to bleed German manufacturers. The future is bleak:

- If talks break down with the UK and we revert to WTO schedules, that's a 10% tariff on German made cars. The UK buys nearly as many German cars as the US, that's not good for the German auto industry.
- Trump will almost certainly win a second term in Nov, and when he does he's coming after the EU, and German cars in particular. Again, a major headwind for this sector.

Given both of these, it's not that unbelievable that German producers will actually expand their operations within the UK (both to protect their access to the UK's domestic market, but also to potentially circumvent forthcoming US sanctions)."

🦠❗️Ukraine refused to return home from China

Kharkiv student Monika Rustamova, who studies Chinese in Wuhan, has refused to fly home because she thinks it is safer for her to remain in isolation there. Monica complains that the evacuation was constantly postponed, the quarantine is kept secret, as are the conditions of transportation. “Nobody is curious about the situation in which we are, what we eat or have at least water. I understand that no one is to blame for us, but when everyone writes everywhere that Ukrainians are provided with material goods here, they deliver provisions and they generally cherish and love, this leads to despair. Everything is very turbid, secret. ”

Another Ukrainian refused to evacuate through a dog, which she was not allowed to take on board.

While I did make a mistake not mentioning that the air is filtered and therefore I apologize and own my mistake (instead of just pointing the finger and raging) 👉 here we go:

""Cabin air is changed every two to three minutes, that is 20 to 30 times every hour, according to Zhu Tao, deputy director of the flight standard department under China’s Civil Aviation Administration. At a news conference last month, he also noted that cabin ventilation systems are designed for vertical, not horizontal, air flow, which effectively reduces the risk of a virus spreading on a plane.


This is because human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus is believed to occur mainly through droplets, which generally are not affected by air flowing through a space, so they fall fairly close to where they originate – usually within a metre.

 
That is why the World Health Organisation defines “contact” with an infected passenger on a plane as having been seated within two to three rows of that person. The infection risk for those sitting outside that zone is much lower.""

And also

""The droplets will fall within a metre from [where] one coughs,” Weiss says. “There’s a reasonable chance that [a sick person] will infect the passengers seated within a metre. The transmission [chance] to anyone else is relatively small.” - Professor Howie Weiss 

So unless you do have a crystal ball to predict who will seat by your side and share the row with you..that wouldn't be a very smart choice if you can postpone"

It's like we fear their economic rise, and we're trying to isolate them and prevent them from becoming a superpower.

We have been pushing them for the past 3 years.  Anyone who has been on reddit has had a front-row seat to the sudden and voluminous anti-China propaganda that has washed over the site.  It's as if the US was psychologically preparing the American public for war with China.  

Every day, there's something new.  Like today, it's the US government designating some Chinese media outlets as propaganda.

We're not going to war with China, are we?  Why?  And why are our leaders being so quiet about it?  Are they trying to start a war in secret?  Shouldn't the American public be brought into the decision making, since we're the ones who are going to be fighting it?

No one is denying the individual cases with younger people dying, however, you also cannot deny the many accounts by people, actually living in Wuhan, saying they could not find a hospital bed, including the movie director you mentioned who couldn't find one for his dad, while nursing his own illness at home.

By all those accounts by people actually going through this, the evidence is that the city is overwhelmed in its medical resources and cannot provide care to everyone. Many are home nursing and do not have the proper resources.  

By all accounts of illnesses outside of China, many people recover, and so are many people inside China too but no media actually reports on this on a daily basis.  Like the 8/9 people in the UK who recovered, the 18 who recovered in Japan, 16707 recovered in China. Why don't the media say this? because it doesn't invite clicks."

When Mr Wang, a tourist from China, was admitted to hospital on Jan 24, he only had a slight cough but felt well otherwise.

Over the next few weeks, the cough persisted, but the 37-year-old Chinese national did not have any other symptoms such as a runny nose or fever.

Tests had shown, however, that he was infected with coronavirus despite the mild symptoms.

It was quite similar to having a cold, and for my case, it felt less severe than a cold,"" the Wuhan native said in an interview in Mandarin with the media on Thursday (Feb 20).

""When I have a cold, I sometimes get a more serious cough or runny nose, but I didn't have these symptoms this time. Maybe I am lucky in this aspect.""

Mr Wang, who did not want to reveal his full name, still had to be hospitalised at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for four weeks as tests throughout that time still found he was still infected.

He was finally discharged on Thursday, after two consecutive tests found him to be clear of the virus.

Coronavirus is particularly deadly for the typical at-risk groups; both of your children qualify, testing is difficult, and there's no treatment at the moment - only symptom management.

Don't let them come back to your home. Leave their stuff outside for them, don't even directly interact. The chances of having contracted coronavirus might be miniscule, but the consequences if you're that unlucky couldn't be any more grave. Your kids would likely die, even if the virus itself doesn't claim them it's going to cripple you enough to stop you caring for them once it takes hold. 

Worst of all, that shit has a long incubation period, and can survive a long time in the environment; no symptoms doesn't mean they're virus-free, you *can't* be sure.

Institute your own quarantine. It's really not worth risking it, and frankly your better off losing them for disrespecting you, than possibly losing your kids for being a doormat."

And this assumes the virus is completely airborne, which we don’t think it is (but we aren’t sure, which is fair to point out, though I admit if it were easily airborne I think we would have already seen much larger outbreaks outside of Hubei than we have). 

As of right now, what do you think the probability is you sit next to someone infected with the virus when entering or leaving Korea? It’s incredibly low. Long story short, the probability some random person visiting Korea gets sick because of the airplane is close enough to zero to ignore it.

This is why I was getting so pissed off in the other thread. People are fear mongering with inaccurate information, or misleading people in a way that leads to fear. As of right now, avoid that cult in Daegu and probabilities suggest you are going to be fine. 

By the way, did you know the original study that suggested the virus could spread when asymptomatic [was flawed](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/05/health/wuhan-coronavirus-flawed-report/index.html)? We think it may be possible to spread when asymptomatic, but we don’t think that’s a [main avenue of new infection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html)."

This is the critical flaw in your reasoning. The cases before Feb 12 were all lab-tested. They changed the criteria after that to be broader (not narrower) which caused an increase in cases on the following day.

From the article:

>Initially, authorities were using nucleic acid tests to identify the presence of the virus, but such tests require days of processing, and there were also shortages of nucleic acid.   
>  
>So last week, Hubei introduced a new, quicker diagnostic method through computerized tomography (CT) scans, which use X-rays, to reveal lung infections, and to confirm the presence of the virus.

So they reported inflated numbers for one week and now reverted back to the system used before last week.

The spike in numbers due to the broader system can be seen on Feb 12 on the total cases graph: [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/)

As for the mortality of the virus, this is the data from the most comprehensive study so far: [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/)

As can be seen, mortality is far below 1% for non-elderly people. Elders are at risk, though."

Or, more accurately, like if the bubonic plague had a child with AIDS, and that child had a child of its own with a hybrid between ebola and the coronavirus, became radioactive, and is constantly on fire.

Remember I /we have existing customers going back many years. Every time I go pick up a pound or so of isolate from lab and text out my customer base it sells. I live 150 mi each way from farm. 

People are buying the CBG and CBD Isolate in bulk as to prepare for end of world - no shit that is what people are telling me. People are so freaked out about Coronavirus they want both of these products in bulk just in case. I guess word is out CBG helps with inflammation and beats back flu symptoms especially lung and headache issues.

The media is blowing it hugely out of proportion. They're fearmongering for clicks.

I went way down the coronavirus conspiracy rabbit hole last week. I'm still pretty convinced of the core points. I will answer your question as a representative of this viewpoint

> To my eyes, the biggest piece of evidence that the virus is controllable is that it isn’t spreading exponentially in the US or Europe. For those on the more alarmist side, how do you account for this fact?

First, I agree. Given how contagious this appears to be, the original trigger point I set for myself, three weeks ago, was ""in two weeks there will be >1000 cases in California"". My logic went something like this: There are currently six cases in california. They have not been effectively quarantined. We believe presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission is possible, so there's an _**extremely low chance**_ that they have not infected other people. The time from infection to showing symptoms seems to be 5-10 days for most cases. So we should see a ton of new cases pop up in 2-3 weeks.""

This has, clearly, not happened. There were 12 confirmed cases nationwide when I made this rule. There are 15 confirmed cases now. No new cases in California as far as I know. This is very unusual. 

But secondly, the answer to your question: ""The biggest piece of evidence... is that it isn't spreading exponentially in the US"". The alarmist side answer to this is ""yes it is"". 

I will say upfront: I am not saying anything below is true. I am saying it _might_ be true and I have not been convinced that it is _not_ true. I want to stress that I am extremely uncertain about this. But this is where my thinking goes. 

In SEA countries like Singapore and Japan, it is clearly spreading. This corroborates both the contagiousness claims out of china and, at least a little bit, their severe response. 

Then look at the UK. It's started spreading there. It hasn't started spreading badly yet (that I know of), but it's started spreading in exactly the way that it should be spreading in the US. 

But then you look at the US. The CDC numbers have not been updated in two weeks, save an update two(?) days ago that cleared 14 suspected cases. This is extremely odd.

Meanwhile, the CDC and various organizations are putting their pandemic preparedness plans into actions. The tone from the US organizations seems to be ""this isn't a problem _**yet**_"". So where is the problem? 

In my mind, the way to square what's happening in the US with what's happening in other countries, that requires the least number of assumptions /  crazy beliefs, is that the US is hiding cases. Presumably to prevent a general panic which, arguably, is the socially optimal thing to do. Because there is absolutely no possible way that both ""This is so dangerous and contagious that 760M people in China are under lockdown"" and also ""somehow the US has had a dozen cases for three weeks, just told them to go home and not leave their houses, and _**zero**_ more people have become infected"" are true. 

Now, the single biggest counter to this position, aside from the obvious ""this is somewhat unfalsifiable"", is the plausibility of suppressing this. I find it plausible that the US could effectively suppress the news of like, a dozen more cases across the country. I don't find it plausible that they could suppress the news of a thousand. This suggests that, _**even if my crazypants conspiracy theory is true**_, things can't be all that bad. But if things aren't that bad, why suppress anything? I have no explanation for this. 

At the end of the day, the only thing I'm comfortable saying with confidence is that **the apparent progression of nCoV/COVID-19 in the US is dramatically discordant with the reports, beliefs, actions, and events occurring in other countries with confirmed cases**.

----

To jam the tinfoil up to 11: a rather close friend of mine, last week Saturday, came down with quote ""a weird laryngitis or something"". Her voice is shot, she's coughing a ton, has flu-like brain endumbening, is sleeping twelve hours every night, and reports feeling like shit. Given the above (that, if widespread infections are being suppressed, there still can't be all that many of them), it is highly unlikely that she caught this, esp given no obvious exposure to anyone from the epicenter. But, well, if she did catch it I imagine she'll be going to the hospital this weekend. 

Also, if she did catch it, she coughed all over my car on Monday. I have a calendar event set for next week monday to remind myself to check for fever/etc, but at the moment I feel fine.

The closest confirmed case of nCoV is about 100 miles from me, in quarantine at one of those army bases for the Wuhan evac flights. Unless this is dramatically more widespread than thought, the prior on this being nCoV is very, very low"
2020-02-20,suuupreddit,investing,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f5qqwm/if_there_is_a_recession_and_i_have_super_credit/fi7vrry/,"TL;DR:  
1. Consumption/Savings rate is too simple to explain buying the dip.  If higher returns are expected (temporary dip), people would reduce Variable Consumption (a subset of Consumption) and increase Investments (a subset of Savings).  
2. I would agree that most individual investors won't identify misvalued stocks, but that it's very possible for an individual who puts a lot of time and effort into their valuations to be accurate enough to generate outsized returns.  
3. Well-run companies generally navigate market crashes with relatively little damage in the long run, whereas investor fear tends to drive these crashes.  This, by definition, means that the stock price will experience a greater temporary movement than the fundamental value of the company.  
____

I'm definitely not speaking in terms of most households.  Most households should set aside some percent of their paycheck to put in 90% SPY and 10% whatever they think will outperform it.

The Econ 101 argument is on the right logical track, but a little oversimplified as far as buying the dip goes.  In practice, consumption can be divided into fixed (rent/mortgage, groceries, stuff that helps you not die) and variable (entertainment, excess food over the not-dying amount, quality-of-life things like the gym and hobbies).  Saving could similarly be divided into simple saving and investing.

So just to write it simply:
>C/S = (FixedConsumption + VariableConsumption)/(Saving + Investment)

Remember that individuals have a (weakly defined, but still existent) required rate of return that dictates their variable consumption, and whether they invest vs save.  Does this $20 concert provide you more joy/utility than the investment returns of $20 in 20 years?  The same math applies for going out to eat, gym memberships, whatever else people do.  This will dictate individuals' variable consumption, and therefore their optimal C/S rate.

Assume that you're at your current optimal C/S rate, and have some variable consumption.  If I come to you with a legal document contractually obligating me to double whatever money you give me in a month (and you know that I can, legally), how does that change the equation?  You would most likely cut all variable expenses save for once-in-a-lifetime experiences, transfer all but one month's worth of savings (including other investments), and probably accept some late fees on fixed expenses since the fees would be lower than your return from me.  Obviously reality is more complicated, but that illustrates my point.  Higher expected returns (from what you believe to be a temporary dip) become preferable to some variable consumption, and you temporarily change your spending accordingly.

Bullet points work better here, so as to the pure fundamentals of it, let's say:  
- Your DCF of AAPL gives you a price of $300/share  
- You leave yourself a 5% margin of error  
- Your personal buy price is $285, so you don't buy at their current price of $320.  
- Then you read their next earnings report, and believe the Coronavirus impacts to only equate to about 1% over the next 10 years.  
- Your fair value is now $297 with a buy price of $282  
- The market reacts strongly, and their price dips to $275  
- You should now buy AAPL stock

As to how to fund it, you'd reallocated from lower expected return variable consumption, investments, and possibly (temporarily) savings as I mentioned above."

There is no good way to kill the flu either.  Flu treatments are only useful in the first 48 hours (before most people go to the doctor) and even then it just slightly reduces flu severity and gets you over it a bit quicker.

> Mr Wang, who did not want to reveal his full name, still had to be hospitalised at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for four weeks as tests throughout that time found he was still infected.

> He was finally discharged yesterday, after two consecutive tests found him to be clear of the virus.

> His 66-year-old father, the first coronavirus patient in Singapore, was discharged a day earlier, having also stayed in hospital for a period of 28 days.

> The pair, along with Mr Wang’s children and a few other family members, had flown to Singapore for a 10-day holiday on Jan 20. The holiday was disrupted after Mr Wang’s father developed a fever on the family’s second day here.

> The father’s fever fell and rose again, and he felt cold and warm intermittently. Mr Wang took him to SGH, which confirmed the infection. Mr Wang was also found to be infected on Jan 24, making him the third coronavirus patient here.

> “I wasn’t very worried as I saw from the news that the disease was more severe for those who are elderly and who have underlying symptoms, but I was worried about my dad, who is older,” said Mr Wang.

> “He had pneumonia, so he had to use a respirator for the first few days to get more oxygen into his blood. He felt a bit unwell, but the doctor told us that his condition was stable, so we felt more assured.”

> Mr Wang’s father told The Straits Times that he felt unwell for about three days. “It wasn’t too unbearable, and I was less worried after my condition stabilised,” he said.

> He passed his time by making phone calls to his son and family members. “I also started practising a bit of martial arts in the isolation room. I have practised for more than 10 days,” he said with a laugh.

> “I made sure to complete all my meals too, as I wanted to stay optimistic and defeat the virus.”

> The younger Mr Wang passed his time by reading books, watching TV shows and calling his family members.

> While both father and son had to spend quite some time in hospital, they said they were well taken care of. The nurses helped to get them dumplings on Chinese New Year’s Eve to help them fulfil a Chinese tradition signifying the changing of years, and also gave them treats such as home-made soup.

> Now that they have recovered, they will spend a few days recuperating here before heading back to Wuhan.

> Mr Wang said: “I had bak kut teh before, and I liked it. I want to take my dad to try the dish; it will be a nice ending to our time here.”

You have commented on literally nothing but coronavirus subreddits for weeks.

An airborne disease is any disease that is caused by pathogens that can be transmitted through the air. Such diseases include many of considerable importance both in human and veterinary medicine. The relevant pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, toilet flushing or any activities which generates aerosol particles or droplets. Human airborne diseases do not include conditions caused by air pollution such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), gases and any airborne particles.
