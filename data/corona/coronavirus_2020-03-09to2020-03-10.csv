Best

1. Hawaii: Only state without a white majority or plurality. Good food, good music, gnarly waves, only problem is that they elect weird Modi stans

2. Vermont: Beautiful landscape perfect for a protracted people's war. Pretty good maple syrup, cheese, and ice cream too

3. California: Despite having millions of people living on the street, massive tech/entertainment feudal kingdoms, and fires that threaten to burn the entire state on a biannual basis, it is still better than nearly every other state in the union by a long shot. Impressive

4. Washington: Epicenter of coronavirus in America, which has the potential to finally end the boomer scourge

5. New Mexico: One of the few states with anything even resembling a culture. Probably the best flag in the country too


Worst

1. Alabama: lol

2. Florida: Hell combination of snow birds, gusanos, and deep south neo-nazis. Will eventually, and probably deserves to be, drowned into the Atlantic by climate change.

3. Lousiana: Effectively a slave state that spends its entire state budget on LSU stadiums. Any kind of french, creole, or haitian culture has been completely lost to the morass of 21st century southern homogeneity

4. Virginia: The perfect synthesis of divorced dads in cars in the southern half and intersectional CIA handlers in NOVA. Probably the only state where the ""lose 1 working class voter and pick up 2 suburban republicans"" strategy has worked

5. Arizona: The dry heat and lack of gusanos make it slightly better than Florida, but it physically should not exist. Entire river basins have been drained to support its golf courses"

I REPEAT NONE OF THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ARE GETTING ACCESS TO TESTS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TESTS.

They are only testing if you meet a VERY VERY stringent symptom display and then you have to be hospitalized for them to test as well. 

It‚Äôs absofuckinglutelt moronic and you can 100% blame this on the trump administration for being worried about god damn optics instead of the well being of the citizens of this country.

Republicans, honestly you people have to wake the hell up and start contacting your local congresspersons. We need people capable of running the CDC put back in place after the administration gutted funding by 90%. Your congresspersons with enough pressure will get the message and force trump to act like a big boy. They‚Äôve done it a few times when it‚Äôs been beneficial for them. This is one of those times when it‚Äôs beneficial for them.

Thinking I had symptoms, I got a disturbing glimpse of the city‚Äôs chaotic and self-contradictory approach to containing the virus.

Two weeks ago, I flew from La Guardia Airport to Toronto for a 24-hour trip.
In the immigration intake area, at least 100 passengers streamed off a flight from Shanghai, where the coronavirus had been found a month earlier. We all pressed our fingers on touch screens to answer immigration questions and waited for about 15 minutes for masked, gloved agents to examine each passport.

The next day, I flew back.

That fleeting contact with people arriving from a country at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak ‚Äî and the knowledge that people were probably arriving at the airport from every other outbreak spot as well ‚Äî rattled me enough that when I developed respiratory symptoms several days after I got home, I was more insistent in seeking health care than I might have been otherwise.

Maybe I was overcautious, but the experience gave me a disturbing glimpse of New York City‚Äôs chaotic and self-contradictory approach to containing the virus.

I first developed a cough. Soon, I also noticed that I was losing my breath just walking a few blocks. I didn‚Äôt want to overreact ‚Äî the most logical explanation was a simple chest cold.

Just in case, I went to my primary care practice ‚Äî I have an immune disorder that could make me more susceptible to illness, and with two young children in school, I wanted to make sure my family didn‚Äôt spread something pernicious.
When I said I wondered if I had the coronavirus, the nurse told me I should have gone straight to the hospital. But she didn‚Äôt seem overly concerned, and didn‚Äôt put on a mask or gloves. I felt relieved when she listened through her stethoscope and said she heard no sign of lung infection.

A few days later, I developed a fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and tremors in my hands. On Google I learned that two people who were later diagnosed with coronavirus had landed at the Toronto airport on the same days as I passed through, Feb. 20 and 21. One person arrived from China and the other from Iran.
Meanwhile, Covid-19 was being diagnosed in the United States in people who had not traveled abroad recently or been in contact with anyone who had.
There must have been many people in New York City like me with symptoms consistent with the coronavirus, wondering: Should I take precautions, to protect other people? Should I avoid panic and just proceed. 

Last Tuesday, after a night fever of 100.8, I called the new New York State coronavirus hotline. I was told to go to the hospital for a test. I called ahead to the emergency room of Mount Sinai Hospital on Madison Avenue in Manhattan.

At the emergency room, I was dispatched to a private room. Two staff people entered wearing masks and gloves.

But the attending doctor came in without a mask and offered his bare hand for a shake. He assured me that I was low-risk because I hadn‚Äôt been to an epidemic country like Italy, South Korea, or China. The hospital would not test me, since I did not meet the hospital‚Äôs criterion for testing, travel to one of those countries, he said. He advised me to go home and continue life as normal. If I felt sick, stay home, and if I felt well, go out. I should only come to the hospital if I felt sick enough to need hospitalization. And my children and husband should continue to go to school and work as usual.

That did not seem like a good way to contain an epidemic.

Still, I felt some relief ‚Äî a doctor had told me I did not have the virus and therefore could stop fretting about transmission and start nursing my illness.

That relief dissipated that evening when my 6-year-old son began sobbing at bedtime. He looked flushed. He had a fever of 99.6. And because I had been sick that day, my 76-year-old mother, who has respiratory problems, had taken my son to an appointment.

I felt scared, guilty, and enormously frustrated that I didn‚Äôt know what it was I was potentially transmitting."

quote:

### ""Italy is also testing post-mortem on Corona 

 In Italy, it is certain, that the largest number of people have been  tested for the corona virus in Europe - and since the first Covid 19  disease appeared on February 20, post-mortem tests have also been  carried out.  An analysis of the first 104 deaths showed that more than [two thirds of the deceased examined had](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/italien-kaempft-gegen-coronavirus-so-leben-die-menschen-in-der-roten-zone/25621354.html&usg=ALkJrhjzAphRxFmslCxhISUWHrwtxjn2tQ) at least two more or less life-threatening previous illnesses. 

 Many of them would not have lived long without being infected by the  virus - or they would probably have survived the virus infection if it  had not been seriously ill and their immune system had been weakened.  These deaths are also counted in the Italian case statistics.  In other countries, they would not have been tested for the corona virus at all. """

Whoa - This has to be replied to because what you just said is dangerously incorrect.

You're confusing symptoms with effects.  The symptoms are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.  That's how you can tell someone might have it.

The effects range from mild, to hospitilization (with many being hospitalized for up to a month) and in many cases permanent lung damage, to a 2%-5% chance of death.  If you dodge the virus completely, ""[It is likely that people you know will die from COVID-19](https://www.julianagrant.com/blog/2020/2/29/coronavirus).""

Being worried or concerned or alert about the coronavirus is not ""losing their minds"" - it's a good response to legitimate danger."

Impact of the epidemic in the US

Now that new COVID-19 cases are being detected in the U.S. every day, it is too late to stop the initial wave of infections. The epidemic is likely to spread across the U.S. The virus¬†appears to be¬†about as contagious¬†as influenza. But this comparison is difficult to make since we have no immunity to the new coronavirus.

On balance, it is reasonable to guess that COVID-19 will infect as many Americans over the next year¬†as influenza does in a typical winter¬†‚Äì somewhere between 25 million and 115 million. Maybe a bit more if the virus turns out to be more contagious than we thought. Maybe a bit less if we put restrictions in place that minimize our travel and our social and professional contacts.

The bad news is, of course, that these infection numbers translate to 350,000 to 660,000 people dying in the U.S., with an uncertainty range that goes from 50,000 deaths to 5 million deaths. The good news is that this is not a weather forecast. The size of the epidemic, i.e., the total number of infections, is something we can reduce if we decrease our contact patterns and improve our hygiene. If the total number of infections decreases, the total number of deaths will also decrease."

Or is about to be. It‚Äôs not clear. Apparently, the order hasn‚Äôt been signed yet. Social media shows people rushing to the station, mainly for the last trains south. This is Milan, economic dynamo of Italy, the only city in the country that has grown stronger and richer through the long years of stagnation since the financial crisis of 2008. An enormous number of people who work here are from the south. If the city is shutting down for the coronavirus, they want to be home.
On Sunday morning, my partner and I¬†eat breakfast listening to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte addressing the nation. A recording made in the small hours. It was utterly irresponsible, he tells us, for someone to leak a rough draft of the order before it had been finalized. It caused immense confusion. Still, the fact remains that 14 million people in northern Italy are now in lockdown ‚Äî and we‚Äôre among them. But thousands of people have already left, very likely taking the virus with them. The governors of the southern regions of Calabria, Campania and Puglia are furious and announce that these arrivals will face restrictions.
That‚Äôs the kind of world we‚Äôre in now. In just two weeks, all the usual certainties have gone. It‚Äôs been a spiritual exercise in letting go. You paid for season ticket on the subway, now you realize subway travel is the surest way of getting the disease. You have a subscription to the gym, the gym is closed. So is the cinema. Your tickets for concerts and football games are useless. Your children can‚Äôt go to school. Or university. Even mass is canceled.

What‚Äôs the mood? Initially, indignation. Two weeks ago, when the first restrictions came in ‚Äî banning all kinds of gatherings and closing pubs, though not actually restricting our movement ‚Äî we were sure they‚Äôd overdone it. A cafe owner in downtown Milan¬†told me angrily that one of the best weeks of the year had been blown: carnival, Fashion Week. Hoteliers complained of 90 percent cancellations. Then we saw the number of infections shoot up: a hundred a day. Two hundred, three hundred. On Sunday, 769 in Lombardy alone. On Saturday, Antonio Pesenti, the head of Lombardy‚Äôs intensive crisis care unit, predicted that ‚Äúby March 26 we will have 18,000 sick people, 3,000 of whom will be needing assistance to breathe.‚Äù The places in intensive care in particular are under pressure. The hospitals in Milan are already planning to move non-coronavirus patients in intensive care to hospitals in other regions

This is sobering. Day by day there has been a greater awareness of the need to keep your distance from people, the importance of not shaking hands. Suddenly the elevator stinks of disinfectant. A man opening a door for you stands way back. You realize the girl on the cash desk in the supermarket is wearing rubber gloves. She apologizes when she sneezes and assures you it‚Äôs only a sinus condition. A manager complains to a boy at the deli counter that he should have said at once that his next-door neighbor has tested positive.

Everybody is being asked to think not just for themselves, but also for the community. Milan is a highly fragmented city. There are all kinds of ethnic groups ‚Äî Chinese, Arabs, Hispanics, Filipinos, Indians, any number of Romanians and Slavs, Italians from every region. Even the locals are quite sharply divided between working and middle classes. And of course many of us communicate more online than on the street, speaking to people like ourselves in other countries and continents. But inevitably the virus is bringing a new awareness that we all share the same physical space, Milan, Italy. We really live here, and we sink or swim together. Perhaps we will even have to get to know each other, albeit without shaking hands. I sense a new spirit of unity.


The fallout for the economy will be huge. But paradoxically the government is very likely to be strengthened. The governing coalition is an association of two main parties (the center-left Democratic Party and the maverick Five Star Movement) who disagree on so much that their only reason for staying in office together has been to avoid an election that would favor the right-wing League party, led by the authoritarian and xenophobic¬†Matteo Salvini. But now they have a major issue that‚Äôs easy to agree on and that will give them a chance to be united and decisive on behalf of the nation. Support for Mr. Salvini has begun to dwindle.
The government can also spend money. The Stability and Growth Pact, an agreement shared by all members of the European Union, requires Italy to keep its deficit within strict parameters. Even when every economic indicator would suggest the need to invest and spend, as in the present prolonged period of near-zero growth, the government is obliged to beg Brussels for the right to introduce this or that incentive. These requests are frequently denied, and the politicians appear powerless.



But in an emergency as dramatic as this, the government is in a position to seize control. The importance of the nation-state is suddenly obvious: Italians must decide for Italians. Measures to spend 7.5 billion euros, around $8.4 billion, have been announced. More, probably much more, is to follow. Businesses are to be compensated, parents with children of school age are to be given babysitting vouchers, a huge investment is being made to purchase medical equipment and increase hospital capacity. One suspects that when, God willing, the emergency is over, there will be those who will not want to relinquish this newfound power and the sense of identity and responsibility it brings.

For the moment, though, it‚Äôs us ‚Äî ordinary citizens ‚Äî who feel powerless. Again and again the word ‚Äúfight‚Äù is being used. The metaphor of battle is deployed: We must combat the virus. Yet it turns out the best way to do so is to stay home, which hardly feels like fighting. All the same, when you do run into people, heading for the shops or the pharmacy, the awareness that you must avoid each other is creating a new complicity, like a dance where you can‚Äôt touch. One can only hope something of this shared understanding will remain."

Later that night, I heard that Vice President Mike Pence had announced that testing for Covid-19 would be possible for anyone. ‚ÄúAny American can be tested,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre removing that barrier.‚Äù Other officials promised that a million people could be tested by the end of the week.
I wanted to be one of them. On Wednesday, I called the hotline again. I explained that Mount Sinai had refused to test me and asked where I could get tested ‚Äî in a doctor‚Äôs office? At a special clinic? The operator told me to go back to the hospital.

Then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took up Mr. Pence‚Äôs edict, announcing that anyone could be tested if a doctor agrees. I called the Mount Sinai emergency room, and asked if testing criteria had changed at the hospital. I was told to come back in, and I arrived that evening.

This time, the E.R. doctor put on a mask, gloves and a gown before entering my room. She explained that the criteria were still not actually that broad: People would be tested if they had either traveled to an epicenter or had knowingly come into direct contact with a diagnosed coronavirus patient. I, of course, had done neither.

I told her I was worried about my son and my mother and my children‚Äôs classmates. The only way to stop this from spreading is to know who is sick, I said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to the powers-that-be,‚Äù she said.
She came back and said she would take two swabs ‚Äî one would be tested for flu and another virus. If tests for the flu came back negative, the other swab would be tested for Covid-19, she said. It was supposed to take about 45 minutes to get the results of the first test.

Three hours later, when I still hadn‚Äôt received the results, I stepped out of my room wearing my mask to ask for information. ‚ÄúGet back in your room, Ms. Shulman,‚Äù called one of the staff at the desk. I paused. ‚ÄúMs. Shulman, get back in your room now!‚Äù she said. I surmised that the flu panel was negative and they were assuming I had the virus.


When the doctor gave me those results, she hovered by the door in her mask, gloves and gown without even entering the room.
‚ÄúYou are officially under quarantine,‚Äù she said. The other swab would go to the C.D.C. for testing.
She left and returned, after another phone call. This time, she walked into my room and sat on a chair opposite me without even putting on her protective gown. My quarantine had been lifted.
Other officials had decided, based on my history, that I was low risk for Covid-19. It seemed to me that the shortage of tests might be influencing their diagnosis.
Nonetheless, she said, I should self-isolate ‚Äî I shouldn‚Äôt go to children‚Äôs birthday parties, but I could wear a mask and go to the grocery store. When I felt better, I could resume activities. My children and husband should stay home if they were sick, but otherwise continue at school and work.
Instead of sending my swab for Covid-19 testing, she told me, they would send it out for a second panel of less-common illnesses. If I was negative for all of that, the New York City Department of Health would consider sending my sample to the C.D.C. for Covid-19 testing, she said. I should call the next day for results.

On Thursday, I phoned for results. ‚ÄúAll I know is your test came up negative and you have to do a full quarantine for 14 days,‚Äù said the physician‚Äôs assistant in the E.R. I said that was starkly different from my most recent instructions. ‚ÄúBased on your negative test results, that‚Äôs the information I have,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou need to call the Department of Health.‚Äù

The number she gave me for the Health Department was wrong, so I called her back. ‚ÄúHonestly, I would just call anyone I can find,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just looking on Google, just like you.‚Äù


The operator at the state coronavirus hotline gave me another wrong number. Finally, I called 311, the city information line. After one more erroneous connection, I reached a call center for the city Health Department, where someone told me she had no idea where my swab was or what my quarantine instructions should be ‚Äî only Mount Sinai Hospital could answer that. She, too, said the city was only testing people who had been to an outbreak country or in contact with someone known to have the virus.
In the meantime, two more seriously ill people were diagnosed with Covid-19 in New York City ‚Äî neither had any foreign travel or known contact with a diagnosed coronavirus patient. Local person-to-person transmission had already begun.
At that point, I called my primary doctor. He said he had just gotten off a call with the C.D.C. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all going to get it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt a certain point, they‚Äôre just going to stop testing and assume people with symptoms have it.‚Äù Meanwhile, he thought that testing should be happening broadly, in every doctor‚Äôs office ‚Äî but of course there were nowhere near enough tests for that. He advised me to stay home except for grocery and pharmacy runs, and wear a mask.
Just because I wanted to see this through, I made one more call to Mount Sinai and asked where my coronavirus swab was. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt sent,‚Äù said the same physician‚Äôs assistant I had talked with before. ‚ÄúActually, I really don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said.
On Friday morning, my 4-year-old daughter, as well as my son, had a fever. Following medical advice, I had sent her to school throughout the week and potentially exposed other children. I was furious. I should not have had to make that decision on my own, without clear medical directives. But the emergency room doctors giving me instructions were trained to save individual lives, not strategize to head off a pandemic.
When I called the press offices of Mount Sinai Hospital and the governor‚Äôs office on Friday to request clarifications for this article, officials at the hospital offered me a Covid-19 test that evening.
On Sunday night I found out it was negative.

>I've also quickly translated other key extracts of the interview, not a perfect translation but I fixed the most glaring mistakes:

>So it's true?
¬´""Indeed it is. In those beds we are admitting only women and men with Covid-19 pneumonia and suffering from respiratory failure. The rest of them at are at home.' ¬ª

>Then what happens?
¬´We put them in non-invasive ventilation, which is called NIV. That's the first step. ¬ª

>What are the following steps?
¬´I come to the most important one. In the early morning, the person in charge of resuscitation passes by with the emergency room personnel. His opinion is very important."" ¬ª

>Why does it count so much?
¬´""In addition to age and the general state, the third element is the patient's ability to recover from an intensive care operation."" ¬ª

>What are we talking about?
¬´""This Covid-19 induces interstitial pneumonia, a very aggressive form of pneumonia that impacts much on the oxygenation of the blood. The most affected patients become hypoxic, that is, they no longer have sufficient amounts of oxygen in the body."" ¬ª

>When comes the time to choose?
¬´Soon after. We need to do it in a couple of days, at most. Non-invasive ventilation is only a passing phase. Since unfortunately there is disproportion between hospital resources, intensive care beds, and critically ill people, not all are intubated.""

>What happens then?
¬´It becomes necessary to ventilate them mechanically. Those you choose to continue are all intubated and put prone, or put on their stomach because this maneuver can promote ventilation of the lower areas of the lung ¬ª.

>Is there a written rule?
¬´ At the moment, no. As a rule, even if I realize that it is a bad thing to say, patients with serious cardio respiratory pathologies, and people with severe coronary artery problems, are carefully evaluated, because they tolerate acute hypoxia poorly and have little chance of surviving the critical phase"". ¬ª

>Anything else?
¬´ ""If a person between 80 and 95 has severe respiratory failure, you probably won't proceed. If you have a multi-organic failure of more than three vital organs, it means that you have a one hundred percent mortality rate. And he's gone. ¬ª

>Do you let him go?
¬´ ""This is also a terrible sentence. But unfortunately it is true. We are not in a position to attempt what are called miracles. It is the reality of the situation ¬ª.

>Isn't that always the case?
¬´""No. Of course, even in normal times it is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, in the wards we try to understand if the patient can recover from any intervention. Now we are applying this discretion on a large scale ¬ª.

>Are these patients dying from Covid-19 or of previous pathologies?
¬´‚ÄúThis is that they don't die of coronavirus is a bitter lie. It is not even respectful of those who leave us. They die of Covid-19, because in its critical form, interstitial pneumonia affects previous respiratory problems, and the patient can no longer bear this situation. The death is caused by the virus, not by anything else ¬ª.

>And you doctors, can you endure this situation?
¬´Some come out crushed. It happens to the department heads, and to the newly arrived boy who finds himself in the early morning having to decide the fate of a human being.¬ª.

>Doesn't it bother you to be the arbiter of the life and death of a human being?
¬´For now I sleep at night. Because I know that the choice is based on the assumption that someone, almost always younger, is more likely to survive than the other. At least, it's a consolation ¬ª.

>What do you think of the latest government measures?
¬´ ""Maybe they're a bit generic. The concept of closing the virus in certain areas is correct, but it arrives at least a week late. What really matters is another thing. ""

>Which is?
""Stay home. Stay home. I don't get tired of repeating it. I see too many people on the street. The best answer to this virus is not to go around. You don't imagine what's going on in here. Stay home. ""

>Is there a shortage of staff?
¬´We are all doing everything. We anesthetists perform support shifts in our operating room, which manages Bergamo, Brescia and Sondrio. Other ambulance doctors end up in the ward, today it's up to me ¬ª.

>In the big room?
""Exact. Many of my colleagues are accusing this situation. It is not only the workload, but the emotional one, which is devastating. I saw crying nurses with thirty years of experience behind them, people who have nervous breakdown and suddenly tremble. You don't know what's going on in hospitals, that's why I decided to talk to her. ""

>Does the right to general care still exist?
""Right now it is threatened by the fact that the system is unable to take on the ordinary and the extraordinary at the same time. So standard treatments can have serious delays ¬ª.

>Can you give me an example?
‚ÄúNormally the call for a heart attack is processed in minutes. Now it can happen that you wait even for an hour or more. """

Consequently, these workers fly to site unwell, and make other people sick. Remember: we're flying in a plane, eating in a mess, commuting to site in cars or buses with others, and sharing workplaces with others. 

Add coronavirus into the mix. I know there's workers where I'm based who will not admit that they've travelled in a high risk country.

>Most countries only attempt social distancing and hygiene interventions when widespread transmission is apparent. This gives the virus many weeks to spread with a higher basic reproduction number (R0) than if they were in place before transmission was detected or widespread. Pre-emptive, low cost, hygiene enhancement and social distancing in the context of imminent community transmission of novel coronavirus COVID-19 should be considered. Early interventions to reduce the average frequency and intensity of exposure to the virus might reduce infection risk, reduce the average viral infectious dose of those exposed, and result in less severe cases who are less infectious. A pre-emptive phase would also assist government, workplaces, schools, and businesses to prepare for a more stringent phase. Countries, and subregions of countries, without recognised COVID-19 transmission should assume it is present and consider implementation of low cost enhanced hygiene and social distancing measures."

The US is in the midst of a recession at least as bad as the 2008 crisis.

The coronavirus has remained a crisis for months, flaring up again as the fall hits. The Trump administration has been utterly incompetent in its response, and the American people are furious. Trump's approval rating ranges from the high 20s to low 30s depending on the poll.

Joe Biden easily won the Democratic nomination, destroying Bernie Sanders so badly in states like Michigan, Missouri, and Florida that Sanders reluctantly conceded far earlier than he had in 2016 -- in mid-March. This was in part because Biden proved a strong ability to attract the kinds of voters who Sanders appealed to last time less because of his own ideas and more because they simply did not like Hillary Clinton. Biden easily won working class whites in the primaries, and amassed huge turnout among black voters. He also has built up huge strength in the suburbs that were already trending heavily Democratic in 2018.

Trump has attempted to attack Biden by going after his son Hunter and the Ukraine scandal he was impeached for, but not only are the American people rather sick of this contrived scandal, every time Trump says anything it is met with a blistering response from Mike Bloomberg, who is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into ads in every state in America blasting Trump's own corruption along with his children.

I'm back from my mods-sponsored vacations I've been sent to, presumably  for trolling bulls at $9k. Having time to rethink my ways in isolation I've come to realisation how wrong I was. To compensate I've put together some quality analysis based on recent developments, full of hopium that is guaranteed to make your bags^(\*) feel immediately lighter.

**Bitcoin is a safe haven**

These trying times have quite clearly shown that bitcoin is going to be a go to asset during the impending recession. As you can see on the [charts](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ESolfqgXgAI2Px9?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) the market hasn't quite caught up to it yet, which is excellent as we can all load up for the one last time before the generational wealth transfer takes place.

**This halving is just like the previous two**

I remember watching all the YouTube videos in 2016 predicting $20k bitcoin on a daily basis and thinking to myself ""no way this is going to happen"". I was in disbelief and missed out on all the gains, which made me then look for the ""next bitcoin"" and go all-in on Vechain in January 2018. Not going to be fooled again though! 

As you can see on this [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BLX/JIGlHgyf-BTC-pre-halving/) during both previous pre-halving periods the price would establish a moderate, but solid uptrend as confirmed by *higher highs* and consistently staying above 21w ema. The fact it's not behaving this way right now is clearly to shake out the weak hands and cool off the RSI.

**S2F as valid as ever**

S2F creator PlanB predicted the price [will not go under $8200 in 2020](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1226918629213499392) and recently reiterated it should be an absolute floor for the dip. The fact that we're lower than that proves the market is wrong. The model is intact as we can deviate from it by an arbitrary amount without invalidating it.

**CME gaps above**

In trading it's important to be able to tell apart the memes (like coronavirus) from real fundamentals which actually affect the market. 

One of the strongest fundamental drivers of bitcoin price is filling of CME gaps. Even if there was no halving and coronavirus were about to wipe out half of the population you can rest assured those gaps are guaranteed to get filled, and we now have two above us at 8.9k and 11.7k. The entire and only reason we dropped here was to fill the gap at 7.7k and none of that meme flu panic.

**Bearish exuberance**

The fact that some bears out there come up with unthinkable targets such as $6k or even $5k is a sure sign of exuberance and we all know how it ends. Everyone should be able to see that a modest and perfectly rational target of $100k is a foregone conclusion at this point and current prices are most likely a once-in-a-lifetime bargain.

**Bitmex traders provide reassurance**

While it's pretty clear that the market is wrong about current valuation of bitcoin, it is reassuring that Bitmex traders, known for their excellent track record, appear to have no doubts about where this is heading. The funding rate has not once gone into negative territory since the ~~top~~ higher high at $10.5k and future premiums are consistently positive which should fill you all with confidence that the bottom is in and a better buying opportunity may never present itself.

And finally, remember, in a risk off environment, when people seek safety in cash and volatility is high, it's best to stick to high leverage bets on new asset classes in illiquid markets.

China launches a bioweapon, on purpose or because the people there in the lab take the experimental animals home as pets or something else, and now governments of the West are going to borrow billions more dollars from China so they can assist Chinese-owned businesses or those who rely on a Chinese ""supply chain"".

There is something that should be sent to China, a bill for all the damage they have caused.

Abby Goodnough
By Abby Goodnough
March 9, 2020
Updated 4:29 p.m. ET

As hospitals around the country prepare for an influx of highly infectious coronavirus cases, their supplies of a crucial type of respirator mask are dwindling fast.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not willing to run out of N95 masks,‚Äù Dr. Susan Ray, an infectious disease specialist at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, said in a phone interview, referring to the masks by their technical name. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not O.K. at my hospital.‚Äù

At some point she may have no choice. Grady executives said on Monday that the hospital had a little more than a month‚Äôs supply of N95 masks; they did not immediately explain whether that estimate was based on normal levels of use or accounted for a possible spike in need. With global supplies already depleted from the outbreak in China and manufacturers facing an explosion of new orders as the virus spreads, some hospitals in the United States have been unable to get new shipments of N95 masks or even an estimate of when they might become available.

‚ÄúI can tell you my other colleagues across our multiple hospitals are really rationing,‚Äù said Dr. Ray.
N95 masks are tighter fitting and thicker than surgical masks. While surgical masks can block only large-particle droplets, N95 masks filter out 95 percent of all airborne particles when used correctly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that they be used only by people with infectious respiratory illness and health care workers who treat or otherwise come in contact with them.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about the patients identified as having the virus,‚Äù said Dr. Wendy Armstrong, another infectious disease specialist at Grady, who is more accustomed to using N95 masks to evaluate patients who might have tuberculosis. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the people you are evaluating to rule out the virus, and the testing is not instant.‚Äù

Protecting health care workers from the virus is essential to managing the epidemic, to ensure hospitals, urgent care centers and other facilities can handle inevitable surges in sick patients. A number of doctors and nurses around the country have already been quarantined for two weeks after patients they interacted with tested positive for the virus; health care workers in China have gotten sick and even died amid extreme shortages of masks and other protective gear.

Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.
The federal government‚Äôs Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies includes 12 million medical-grade N95 masks and 30 million surgical masks ‚Äî only about one percent of the 3.5 billion that the Department of Health and Human Services estimates would be needed over the course of a year if the outbreak reaches pandemic levels. The department announced last week that the federal government had put in a guaranteed order for 500 million N95 masks over the next 18 months, a move it said would encourage manufacturers ‚Äúto immediately increase production of N95s for use by health care professionals.‚Äù

A spokeswoman for the health and human services department said the first step for hospitals experiencing shortages was to ask their local or state public health department, many of which have their own emergency supplies.
‚ÄúIf the state is unable to provide supplies, state health officials ‚Äî through the governor or his or her representative ‚Äî may request federal assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services,‚Äù the spokeswoman said. ‚ÄúWe are working with industry partners and soliciting information about their capacity to produce masks and other protective equipment so we can rapidly arrange contracts to buy supplies to protect the American people.‚Äù

The Washington State Department of Health told health care providers last week it would start following World Health Organization guidelines, which say that surgical masks, which protect against droplets but do not form a seal around the face, should be used except when performing ‚Äùaerosol-generating procedures‚Äù like intubation.

The hospital shortages stem not only from global supplies being depleted after the prolonged outbreak in China but also because of widespread panic-buying of masks by anxious citizens here and abroad. Most hospitals don‚Äôt keep a large supply on hand, because they are not in the practice of buying far more than they need at any given time.

Tony Morain, vice president of communications at Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization in Santa Barbara, Calif., said the group had become so frustrated by shortages even before the virus outbreak that it had contracted with a company in China to start manufacturing its own supply.

Direct Relief had two million N95 masks on hand in early January, Mr. Morain said, anticipating another busy wildfire season in the western states this summer. Then the Australian wildfires happened, and the group sent a few hundred thousand masks there. When the Chinese outbreak escalated, Direct Relief sent most of its remaining stock there.

‚ÄúNow we are receiving quite a few requests from health centers around the country and our supply stands at about 500,000 N95 masks,‚Äù Mr. Morain said, adding, ‚ÄúIn the coming days, we will start apportioning them out to areas where health workers are at extreme risk of exposure.‚Äù

At Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif., emergency room physicians said they had been dipping into reserves and hoping that the state of emergency that Gov. Gavin Newsom declared last week would allow them to access whatever supply the state had on hand.
Lindsay Caulfield, a senior vice president at Grady Health, said Monday morning that the system had ‚Äúover a 35 day supply‚Äù of N95 masks, adding, ‚ÄúWe buy the maximum amount allowed to us each week‚Äù from the manufacturer Grady contracts with.

Spokespeople for several other large hospital systems contacted last week ‚Äî including IU Health in Indianapolis, Jackson Health in Miami, the University of Vermont Medical Center and the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation ‚Äî said in carefully worded statements that they had a sufficient supply of N95 masks for now.

‚ÄúIn anticipation of possible supply chain disruptions in the coming months, we are implementing steps to preserve personal protective equipment while maintaining all clinical guidelines and protocols,‚Äù said Alyscia Grant, a spokeswoman for Care New England, a nonprofit system with several hospitals in Rhode Island.

The Food and Drug Administration last week granted a request from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to allow health care workers to use similar respirator masks approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ‚Äî not currently regulated by the F.D.A., and typically used in construction and manufacturing ‚Äî during the coronavirus outbreak.

The C.D.C. has also said that if shortages worsen during an outbreak, N95 masks can be used for ‚Äúrepeated close contact encounters with several patients‚Äù instead of being thrown away after one encounter, as well as beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life.

If no respirators are left, the newly updated C.D.C. guidance says, health care providers who are older, have chronic medical conditions or are pregnant should avoid treating patients with Covid-19. Providers who have already had the disease, ‚Äúwho may have some protective immunity,‚Äù should be the first to treat them if no masks are available.
Dr. Ray of Grady Hospital said doctors there and at a number of other hospitals she had been in contact with were also concerned about running low on regular medical masks, to the point where Grady, one of the nation‚Äôs largest and busiest public hospitals, had made them harder to access.

‚ÄúHealth care workers, visitors ‚Äî if someone sees masks, they are grabbing and taking them,‚Äù she said. Under the new rules, she said, ‚ÄúIf people need them, they‚Äôll have to ask.‚Äù

Doctors who see a lot of sick patients in their offices, rather than a hospital, are increasingly anxious, too. One physician at an outpatient center that is part of the N.Y.U. Langone Health System, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely, said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have N95 masks, and are being asked to see patients with surgical masks instead. We are considering refusing to see potential Covid patients unless we have proper protection.‚Äù (‚ÄúCovid‚Äù refers to the name of the disease caused by the virus, Covid-19.)

Dr. Marc Habert, a pediatrician in Fishkill, N.Y., said the group he works for, with eight offices in three counties, had virtually no N95 masks or other protective equipment on hand.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt get any. Everything‚Äôs back-ordered,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was on a phone call earlier with the local department of health and they basically said the state has supplies, but we need to show we tried to order from three separate places first.‚Äù

Georgia had six confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Monday afternoon, including a teacher in the Atlanta area, which led to a decision to close public schools in Fulton County on Tuesday for deep cleaning. Nobody with the virus has been treated at Grady so far, but Dr. Ray said the hospital recently saw one suspected case that proved negative for the virus after several days during which workers went through a lot of personal protective equipment.

‚ÄúRight now we are just anticipating that we are going to have a lot of patients,‚Äù Dr. Ray said, ‚Äúand we aren‚Äôt going to have enough supplies if we don‚Äôt figure out how to use less.‚Äù"

This is the first semester that I'm really enjoying my classes and professors (ironically my last full semester, I plan on graduating in August) and I enjoy going 90% of the time (most of that 10% has to do with parking troubles). 

As much as I would like to keep going to classes, I hate going to school right now with everything going on. Sure I keep washing my hands and using my elbow to open doors, but what about my laptop that sits on the desk? Or my jacket on the chair? Or my professor checking my student ID for my midterm? I had to move seats twice today because of very obviously sick people attending school. Was it coronavirus? Doubt it. But that just proves that if school is in session, kids are going to go no matter what and spread whatever it is that they have. 

The coronavirus is spreading quick and while I'm sure I'll be fine, I don't want to be a vehicle for disease to spread to others. And maybe it's selfish, but I don't want my professors to get sick and be out of commission to teach my classes. I want to learn. I know going online is a disruption, but an even bigger disruption is waiting too long to act and having to deal with a incapacitated student body and faculty."

> PROVIDENCE -- Governor Gina M. Raimondo on Monday declared a state of emergency in Rhode Island as the state tries to contain an outbreak of the coronavirus. Declaring a state of emergency gives us more tools in our toolbox, Raimondo said. Specifically, it will enable us to better tap into resources of the National Guard, if necessary, and it will make sure that we are first in line for any federal resources.A declaration that an emergency exists allows the state government to ease certain regulations so it can respond more quickly, such as buying supplies or hiring more workers to help local health officials. Last week, state health officials said they had decided against declaring a state of emergency because the state had not seen widespread community transmission of the virus. It is true, thankfully, we don't yet have and hopefully won't have broad community transition, Raimondo said Monday. 

> But, she said, declaring an emergency would allow the state to quickly take steps such as activating the National Guard. She said the National Guard has not been activated yet, but they the Guard is already assisting and might be called upon to do more. Also, the state Department of Health director, Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, noted that, We have states around us who have community transmission. When asked it was a mixed message to declare an emergency while urging calm, Raimondo said, What I'm saying to the people of Rhode Island is: We need to take action. This is real. This is here. We expect more cases. But at the same time, she said, Statistically and factually, the risk to the average Rhode Islander at this point is low. So on an individual basis, Rhode Islanders need to take steps such as washing their hands and staying home if they're sick, Raimondo said. And as governor, she said, It's my job to make sure that we are protected for today, tomorrow, a week, and two weeks. So I'm putting everything in place to make sure we have as robust a response as possible so we are never caught flatfooted.

> The state has set up two coronavirus testing sites in non-healthcare settings, using large tents, Department of Health spokesman Joseph Wendelken said. The goal is to do the testing away from doctors' offices and hospitals so that more people don't get infected, he said.

> Governor Raimondo said people would, in some cases, be able to drive through the testing sites. We are piloting them, Wendelken siad. They can have people drive through. But it can be challenging with the wind. At those locations, people will have their noses swabbed, and the samples will be sent to the State Health Laboratories for analysis, Wendelken said. State officials did not say where the testing sites are located and emphasized that they are not public facing. Members of the public should call their doctors first. Health care providers will then contact the Department of Health, and if people meet the criteria for testing, they will be directed to the test sites, officials said. There already is a team of five specialists from the federal Centers for Disease Control in the state, where four people have been infected and 290 people are now quarantined. There already is a team of five specialists from the federal Centers for Disease Control in the state, where four people have been infected and 290 people are now quarantined.Three students at Brown University are being tested for the virus, which causes a respiratory illness known as Covid-19, and are isolated pending the results of that test. Lifespan, the health agency that runs five hospitals in Rhode Island, stopped visits to patients last week.And state health officials continue to instruct nursing home operators to protect their elderly residents, who are at high risk for dying from the infection, by banning visitors who are younger than 18; traveled internationally in the previous 14 days; currently feel sick; or are having symptoms such as cough, fever, chills, runny nose, stuffy nose, sore throat, or shortness of breath.They also have told the homes to screen everybody -- including employees, visitors, and vendors -- who enters their facilities for signs of illness or risk for Covid-19. The outbreak grew out of a trip to Europe, including Italy, by a group of students, staff, and teachers from Saint Raphael Academy, in Pawtucket, during February school vacation. Three people on that trip -- a male in his 40s, a teenage girl, and a woman who lives in Norfolk County in Massachusetts but works at Saint Rays -- fell ill and tested positive. The fourth person was not connected to the trip: She works at the Smithfield Avenue Nursery School in Pawtucket and apparently contracted the illness after she had direct contact in late February with a person in New York with a confirmed case, Rhode Island health officials said Friday night. The man who contracted the states first case of coronavirus remains hospitalized in stable condition, and he is continuing to improve, Alexander-Scott said. The other who tested positive remain at home with mild symptoms, health officials said."

Ryan added that recovery is often measured by the patient no longer exhibiting symptoms and having two consecutive negative tests for the virus at least one day apart, but some countries may measure ""recovery"" differently.

To date, there is no specific medicine to treat coronavirus illness, but those infected can recover with appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms ‚Äî and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care, according to WHO."

But, given the trends, I'm severely disappointed with Canada's and McGill's response to COVID-19. There is, at the very least, a strong precedent that containment efforts in Canada will also fail, leading to community spread. That's a scary thought, even if the average incubation period is a conservative number of days. In fact, it would definitely not be a dubious assumption to take that possibility as a given at this point. Since any uncontrolled growth of a population (including viruses) is exponential in nature, promoting slightly stricter safety measures only when a sudden surge of cases cluster around us may not be sufficient to slow down the spread significantly. For all we know, nothing less than the harsh containment efforts in the East can possibly slow down the spread enough to allow more recoveries than infections, and I highly doubt most of those measures are possible to implement here in North America. 

Given the trends, Canada and McGill University SHOULD promote remote work, much like Princeton University is doing now. 
https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/03/09/updated-policies-and-guidance-covid-19

Our community needs to go above and beyond what's being recommended right now if they want prevention or even alleviate the almost certain damage control that needs to be done in the coming weeks. Promote social distancing. Discourage penalizing students for not attending lectures in person. Consider alternate marking schemes that emphasize remote work. 

All McGill University is doing right now is encouraging ill-informed complacency and are not actually preparing students for a possible outbreak. ""Don't worry, wash your hands, consider staying home if you have the sniffles"", is the overall message given in the McGill coronavirus email updates for the past weeks. In my honest opinion, that just shows that our University prefers minimizing the disruption of people's lives rather than maximizing the safety of the members of its community. We should all do better."

Hey, everyone. It's me, the guy that kept updating from Spain. Forgive me for my delays, but I had some stuff to do at home, including college work. Also, sorry for the clickbait title, too. I put it this way because i do bring some news about the current situation in Spain.

First things first, the cases have skyrocketed, although we should've seen that coming. Just between Sunday and today, the cases have reached 1200, and the government of Madrid has taken one measure that caught me a bit surprised: all schools and colleges in the capital have been closed off from 11th of March to 26th of March. It did not help that we had the 8th of March protests happening, and since they took place, I have to assume that it will become a hotspot soon.

Does it mean that we should panic? Fuck no! What people don't understand is that these are medical protocols that need to be activated in these kind of scenarios. Portraying them as a world ending or economical collapse scenario is downright irresponsible by both Old and Social Media. In Torrejon, the situation is still stable, as far as we know. All we can do right now is to just sit tight, take control of what we can do, and thats it. 

About all of this, it means that I will get to spend some more time with dad. That being said, being unable to go to college for 2 weeks will get eventually boring. I suppose i'll have to find a way to kill time, overall. I hope that you guys are all doing good so far, at least.

Please don't mistake my words for panic or anything. We knew this was going to happen, we knew that the virus would hit hard. I only wished that the 8th of March protests had been suspended, but they went ahead with them anyways. At this point, social distancing probably is for the best. For a while, at least.

I'll keep you guys updated on this as the situation unfolds. But do not despair for us here. We'll be fine. Just keep being awesome, and i'm looking forward to speaking with all of you again. For clarity of mind, go watch Doctor Mike's video regarding the media coverage of the Coronavirus. But we'll make it through this, i'm sure of it. Keep calm, and carry on!"

2020-03-09,nogaras,CoronavirusUS,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fg67sk/gut_wrenching_account_of_relatives_of_kirkland/fk2qki2/,"KIRKLAND, Wash. ‚Äî The hardest day of Debbie de los Angeles‚Äôs life had been the day she put her mother into a nursing home. That was before coronavirus.

As fatal infections spread through the Life Care Center in suburban Seattle, where her 85-year-old mother lived, Ms. de los Angeles had tried not to worry. Nurses were monitoring her mother‚Äôs temperature. They reassured Ms. de los Angeles that her mother had no fever, cough or other signs of infection.

But at 4:15 a.m. on Tuesday, a nurse called with troubling news. Her mother, Twilla Morin, had developed a 104-degree fever. They were giving her Tylenol. Then the nurse confirmed her do-not-resuscitate orders.

‚ÄúWe anticipate that she, too, has the coronavirus,‚Äù a voicemail message from a nurse said. ‚ÄúWe do not anticipate her fighting this.‚ÄùMoving into a nursing home can be a wrenching choice for aging parents and their adult children. But families said they never imagined facing a public health crisis in the quiet hallways where they once believed their loved ones would be safe.

In the week since the Kirkland nursing facility became the focal point of an unfolding coronavirus outbreak in the Pacific Northwest, daily life has stalled into a sleepless, slow-motion agony. With visits restricted, families now call and call for updates from the overworked nursing staff. The families wonder whether they should demand a visit, risking their own health and wider contamination. Some want their parents moved to the hospital or to a different facility but have no idea who else would care for fragile patients potentially exposed to a deadly disease.


‚ÄúI just feel ill that my mom could be dying alone,‚Äù said Vanessa Phelps, whose 90-year-old mother has chronic breathing problems and has lived at the facility for four years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pure panic and I can do nothing. I have no control.‚ÄùSome families now call twice a day to ask how their octogenarian parents are feeling and reassure them about the alarming television news transmitted into their rooms, much of it featuring the crisis right there inside the center. Some video chat on tablet computers designed for older users. One woman stood outside her mother‚Äôs window to catch a glimpse between the slats.
It has been like seeing a ship sink without lifeboats. ‚ÄúWe are watching from the shore and not being able to do anything,‚Äù said Alex Stewart, whose 95-year-old grandmother lives in the nursing center and has been crocheting a small blanket in anticipation of Ms. Stewart‚Äôs baby ‚Äî her first great-grandchild. ‚ÄúIt is a very helpless feeling.‚ÄùNobody knows for sure how the coronavirus first entered the facility, which has become a grim warning of how the virus can spread particularly quickly inside nursing homes. At least eight of the 14 coronavirus deaths in the United States have been Life Care residents, and at least a half dozen other people connected to the facility have been sickened by the virus. Even amid intense scrutiny of the nursing center and its record of handling infections, families said they were struggling to get basic information from Life Care‚Äôs leaders and public health officials. They said they had spent untold hours on the phone, being shunted between county and state government offices and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One man said he called a federal hotline and introduced himself as the son of an octogenarian Life Care resident. The response, he said, was concerning: He was asked whether there had been any coronavirus cases in his area.

Many residents inside the 190-bed facility went days without being tested for coronavirus, families said, even as they and their roommates started coughing and feeling feverish. Families worry that the true number of infections may be higher than official totals.

Experts in infectious diseases say older people, many of whom have underlying health problems and respiratory problems, are particularly vulnerable to the virus and have a higher risk of death.

‚ÄúPeople keep saying, ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt you just go and bust them out?‚Äô‚Äù said Kevin Connolly, whose 81-year-old father-in-law, Jerry Wall, has been at the home for about a year recovering from heart failure.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his home,‚Äù Mr. Connolly said. ‚ÄúHe likes the food, he likes the care, he has friends there.‚Äù

At a news conference on Wednesday, Dr. Jeff Duchin, the officer for public health in Seattle and King County, said teams were now working to test every Life Care resident for the virus, and apologized for a breakdown in communication. A federal disaster medical assistance team was expected to arrive at the center on Thursday. Ellie Basham, the executive director of Life Care, said in a statement that it was assigning every resident a representative who could answer questions from family members.

Families welcomed the promised help, and praised the nurses and caregivers who showed up to work even as the virus spread and as several employees tested positive. It appeared that the virus tests were underway on Thursday; one relative reported that her father had been swabbed.

On Wednesday night, Ms. Stewart said her grandmother had begun to feel chills and short of breath.

‚ÄúShe rang for the nurse, but they hadn‚Äôt come yet,‚Äù Ms. Stewart said. By Thursday, her grandmother was feeling better. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping it was just a blip and not the virus,‚Äù Ms. Stewart said. ‚ÄúBut we don‚Äôt know yet until she‚Äôs tested.‚Äù
Day by day, desperation has grown for families of sicker, weaker residents.

Bridget Parkhill‚Äôs 77-year-old mother had been ill for nearly a week inside the home. On Wednesday, she was taken to the hospital after her coughing worsened and she felt a heaviness in her chest. ‚ÄúWe are devastated that it‚Äôs come to this,‚Äù Ms. Parkhill said. Her mother returned to the home on Thursday.

Ms. de los Angeles, 65, said that her mother, Ms. Morin, had never wanted to move into a nursing home.

Ms. Morin had been a numbers whiz, once halting an embezzlement scheme while working as a bookkeeper. She had also learned to day trade stocks and would get up early for the market open on Wall Street, three time zones ahead of her home in Kennewick, in southeastern Washington State.
Ms. Morin moved into her first nursing home about four years ago after she could no longer stand or walk by herself. As her dementia deepened, Ms. Morin sometimes confused Ms. de los Angeles, her only child, for her sister.

Her world at the Life Care Center, where she had lived for two years, had narrowed to her shared room, the wheelchair she rolled to the dining room and the table where she often ate by herself. She loved a cup of hot chocolate at night and cared for a doll as if it were a real child. In lucid moments, she knew she was proud of her grandsons, Ms. de los Angeles said.

Ms. de los Angeles wanted to race to the nursing facility this week when she heard that her mother‚Äôs condition was deteriorating. But she knew the risks of infecting her husband, who has lung problems, were too great.
She got regular updates from the nurses caring for her mother, and was comforted that mother‚Äôs favorite nurse was on duty, and that her mother appeared to be mostly sleeping. And yet.

‚ÄúWe wanted to be there,‚Äù Ms. de los Angeles said. ‚ÄúShe was alone.‚Äù

Early on Wednesday morning, Ms. de los Angeles woke to a new voicemail message from Life Care. Her mother had died at 2:10 a.m., the message said. Because of the ‚Äúunique situation‚Äù at the home, her mother‚Äôs remains had to be picked up by the coroner, a nurse said. By late morning, Ms. de los Angeles and her husband, Bob, were sitting on living-room couches at their home in Monroe, Wash., surrounded by their four grown sons, looking at old photos and sharing memories of Ms. Morin.

They had to arrange her cremation and decide whether it was safe to pick up her ring, stuffed teddy bear and other belongings. They were waiting for test results to determine whether Ms. Morin had contracted the coronavirus. It had been a month since the family‚Äôs last visit, so they were not worried about being infected themselves. Ms. de los Angeles said she simply needed to know.

‚ÄúI still question what‚Äôs going on in that nursing home,‚Äù Ms. de los Angeles said. ‚ÄúThey gown up. They wear masks. But the virus is still making its way around.‚Äù"

> Well, the term pandemic isn't simply that a disease is spreading around the world. The WHO also thinks about how severe it is and what impact it has. As the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained yesterday, the disease needs to have a significant impact on at least two continents for him to consider it a pandemic. And he is mindful of the power of a label...  ...And he says it is entirely possible, of course, that this will become a pandemic, but by his definition, we are not there yet. In the past, the term pandemic has been used to describe major influenza outbreaks, including two in the previous century and one around 2009, which was the swine flu thing which swept the globe and killed something like half a million people."

Just because one guy only lines up with you politically 75% doesn't make him as bad as the they who lines up with you 0%.  

The irony is this line of thinking is what's hurting Bernie.  When potential allies are told that if they're not 100% with him, they're just as bad as Trump, they don't exactly feel welcome.  It's also dangerous to think any politician is beyond criticism."

‚òÖIt also spreads faster than the flu.‚òÖ

The flu has a transmission rate of 1.3, Covid-19 is estimated at 2 - 2.5. 


There are also no vaccines for this thing. The last Coronavirus that hit us badly was SARS in 2003. No vaccine for that either. 


_________________________________


If all this is too complicated, let me put some real numbers to this thing. 


As of Feb. 22,¬†in the current season¬†there were at least 32 million cases of flu in the United States, 310,000 hospitalizations and 18,000 flu deaths, according to the C.D.C.


You have a 0.05% chance dying of the flu this season. Covid-19 has a 3.5% chance of dying. At minimum, we should be 70 times more afraid of dying from this thing. 


Hospitalization rates look like 0.1% for the flu. Covid-19 patients have ~14% chance of needing ICU artificial ventilators. Serious cases seem to apply more or less equally to all age groups. I'm at least 140 times more worried about NOT being able to get a hospital bed for 2 weeks. 


If the same amount of people caught this as the flu, about 4.4 million people would need ICU beds, with a ventilator. The USA has around 1 million normal beds, and maybe 100k-200k ventilator units. 


Covid-19 looks to be 50-90% MORE contagious than the flu, so numbers will be higher. 

And that's on top of existing flu deaths.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been very crazy,‚Äù said one of the thousands of New Yorkers under quarantine about the official guidance she has gotten.

For two women who had learned just the day before that they had tested positive for the coronavirus, the call on Saturday from the New York City Health Department offered some implausibly good news, they recalled.

One of the women had to stay under quarantine. But the other, who had been without symptoms for a few days, was free to go about her life.
As strange as that sounded, the reversal that followed showed how haphazard the official handling of the quarantine process has sometimes been in clusters of virus cases across the New York region and elsewhere in the United States.

At 11:30 p.m. that evening, a Health Department worker came to the apartment where the women had been staying since they returned sick from a cruise. He told them not to open the door and slid a sheet of paper under it. The women said they were told to sign the document and slide it back out.


It was an isolation agreement: Both women were confined to the apartment indefinitely, until the Health Department declared them safe.
As the number of coronavirus cases in New York State rose to 142 on Monday, government officials scrambled to limit the spread. Dozens of colleges and schools were closed, events were canceled and many thousands of people across the nation were under quarantine ‚Äî one of the most powerful tools at the government‚Äôs disposal.

But a week after the virus first appeared in New York, the state residents under quarantine have largely been left to fend for themselves.
Local health departments in New York State are supposed to check in daily even with people under precautionary quarantine, the lowest category of risk for contracting the virus. But in many cases, they have not started doing so yet.
And when the authorities do issue guidance or directives, they can seem contradictory or illogical.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been told everything from it was OK to go out, to we had to sign a release that we‚Äôre housebound now,‚Äù said one of the women who received an isolation order and who spoke on the condition that her name not be published. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been told we don‚Äôt need to be tested, to we have to be tested. We‚Äôve been told that someone‚Äôs coming to our house to test us, to ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got to find someplace.‚Äô


We‚Äôve been told to call ahead for testing so that they‚Äôre prepared, and we get there, and nobody is prepared, we‚Äôre just in the emergency room with everyone else who‚Äôs waiting. It‚Äôs been very crazy.‚Äù

The presence of the coronavirus in New York had been anticipated for weeks; in January, New York City‚Äôs health commissioner declared that it was ‚Äúinevitable.‚Äù

Yet city and state health officials said that because the outbreak had accelerated so quickly, it required a constantly evolving public health response.

‚ÄúThis thing is moving like a freight train,‚Äù Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday. ‚ÄúA lot is changing quickly.‚Äù

State officials defended their handling of those under quarantine.

‚ÄúWe are in constant communication with local health departments and maintain a strong presence in the community that is currently most impacted,‚Äù a spokeswoman for the department, Jill Montag, said in a statement.

The New York City Health Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the frustration New Yorkers have expressed about navigating the quarantine process.

People under quarantine across the city said they were finding more questions than answers about how to handle everything from the mundane chores of daily life to the most primal tasks of parenting."

---

For the professionals who try to manage homeland-security threats, reassuring the public after a natural disaster or terrorist attack‚Äîor amid a coronavirus outbreak like the one the world now faces‚Äîis just part of the job. I am a former federal and state homeland-security official. I study safety and resiliency issues in an academic setting, advise companies on their emergency-response plans, and trade ideas with people in public health, law enforcement, and many other disciplines. Since the beginning of the disease now known as COVID-19, I‚Äôve also been receiving more and more text messages from nervous relatives and friends. The rash decisions that panic breeds have never made any emergency better. So like many others in my field, I‚Äôve been urging people, in as calm a tone as I can muster, to listen to experts and advising them about concrete steps they can take to keep their families, communities, and businesses safe. Wash your hands. Don‚Äôt touch your face. Avoid large gatherings. Don‚Äôt panic, and prepare as best you can.

Advice like mine is meant to be empowering, but now I fear it may also be misleading. If Americans conclude that life will continue mostly as normal, they may be wrong. The United States is far less prepared than other democratic nations experiencing outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. Low case counts so far may reflect not an absence of the pathogen but a woeful lack of testing.

Disruptions are almost certain to multiply in the weeks to come. Airlines are scaling back flights. Conferences, including Austin‚Äôs signature event, South by Southwest, are being canceled. The drop in imports is hurting global supply chains. Corporations are prohibiting their employees from traveling and attending mass gatherings. Stanford University just canceled its in-person classes for the rest of the winter quarter, and other institutions are likely to take similar steps. Government agencies and private companies alike will activate continuity-of-operations protocols, as they are called in my field. Get used to it.

Aggressive steps are essential to protecting the public from a deadly virus. Last week, the World Health Organization assessed the fatality rate at a shocking 3.4 percent, much higher than previously believed. Early on, many American medical experts withheld judgment about the limited data coming out of China, but information from around the world has now confirmed how severe COVID-19 is and how rapidly it is spreading. As Dr. Margaret Bordeaux, my colleague at the Security and Global Health Project at Harvard‚Äôs Kennedy School, told me, ‚ÄúNone of us want to be Chicken Little, but there is too much consistent data to not begin to rattle the cage pretty loudly.‚Äù

Even if the United States were far more ready for COVID-19, the consequences could still be grievous. In my field, adequate preparation means having the plans, money, equipment, and expertise in place to avert all but a tiny percentage of the harms that might otherwise occur. Yet because of the nature of pandemics, even a level of preparation that looks robust to homeland-security experts could still fail to prevent thousands of deaths.

I live in Massachusetts. During the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, three people died at the finish line, as two homemade bombs ripped through the crowd of spectators. It was a tragedy for their families and the people of Boston. Nearly 300 other people were injured. Fortunately, the city has a large number of hospitals with excellent trauma centers and was therefore unusually well prepared for such an emergency. Some people were treated on the scene; 127 others‚Äîmany of whom lost limbs‚Äîwere transported to local hospitals. Not a single patient who survived the initial blast died. Was this good news? Unequivocally yes. The efforts of so many first responders and health professionals, and the public, saved those who might have otherwise died. But success is relative. That even careful preparations could still leave some people dead and others badly harmed is both a fact of life and appalling to accept.

A threat as dire as the new coronavirus exposes the weaknesses in our society and our politics. If Americans could seek testing and care without worrying about co-pays or surprise bills, and if everyone who showed symptoms had paid sick leave, the United States could more easily slow the spread of COVID-19. But a crisis finds a nation as it is, not as its citizens wish it to be.

The coronavirus‚Äîand the measures enacted to stop it‚Äîcould quickly change the rhythms of Americans‚Äô daily lives. The United States is seeing its first deaths, first emergency declarations, first school closings, first mandatory work-at-home policies. If the number of COVID-19 cases spikes quickly, hospitals could soon be deluged with patients seeking care. This is a predictable consequence of any epidemic, but few Americans‚Äô personal experience gives them any reason to understand how disruptive these changes could be if the epidemic continues to worsen.

Ironically, the officials now urging citizens to keep calm understand far more acutely than the general public how much else can go wrong. A municipal police chief in the Boston area recently urged me to imagine that a school district closed for even three weeks. Take just one child, raised by a single parent who is a police officer. The child is home, so the parent must stay home. Other officers in the same patrol will be affected even if they don‚Äôt have kids in school. Shifts will change, nonessential functions will be put off, and the department will have less flexibility to respond to problems unrelated to the epidemic‚Äîeven as, with more teens unsupervised, rates of car accidents and certain crimes could well increase.

Emergency-response officials are hesitant to play out these dangers in public. This police chief asked me not to identify him because, like so many others in positions of responsibility, he worries that misgivings like his will become self-fulfilling prophecies‚Äîthat citizens will panic if their local authorities give voice to their own doubts.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump and his administration have vacillated between ignoring the threat and making wildly unrealistic promises about it. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence promised 1.5 million coronavirus tests, but The Atlantic reported Friday that, according to all available evidence, fewer than 2,000 had been conducted in the United States. Trump himself is simply lying about basic facts about the COVID-19 response; despite the testing kit shortfall, he has publicly stated that everyone who wants to get tested can get tested.

China‚Äôs aggressive containment of the new virus in the early weeks of this year gave other nations time to ready themselves for what was inevitably going to come: a shortage of test kits and personal protective equipment for a virus that spreads as quickly and causes as many deaths and hospitalizations as COVID-19 does.

The United States wasted that opportunity. Trump‚Äôs initial impulse to downplay the risk, at least until the stock market took note, wasn‚Äôt just fanciful; it was dangerous. He has consistently minimized the number of sick, blamed Barack Obama‚Äôs administration for a shortage of test kits, and publicly mused about the potential of a vaccine being found quickly. The American response to the new disease should be based on something more than hunches and magical thinking.

The whole time, people like me have been dutifully advising friends, family, and everyone else to take prudent precautions and avoid panicking. That‚Äôs still good advice, because any measures that slow the spread of the disease and lower the death rate could save thousands of lives. But Americans should also understand that even the best preparation humanly possibly wouldn‚Äôt be perfect‚Äîand that what the United States has done so far falls far short of that. Especially at this point, even a more vigorous response will not preclude a lot of people from getting sick. Preventing all infections is no longer a possibility, and the measure of success is how much public-health authorities can reduce the number of people who die or fall seriously ill.

That's reasonable given that the coronavirus outbreak in the US may end up requiring an Italy-like response when we do actually get widespread testing done and figure out the true extent of the spread.  Markets are starting to expect things like Disney World closures and the like.

One key thing to pay attention to is that we are likely to overshoot the downside and recapture a bit of the overshoot quickly.  So there will be a mini-V that forms in stocks at some point in the next 2-4 weeks.

If we go south of S&P 2715 (the key technical level right now, 20% pullback from ATHs signalling a bear market), I think we quickly sell to 2550-2650.  That's an area where things start to really look like good long-term buys assuming that there's no second wave of infections from China or Italy/South Korea/etc..

We'll probably bounce hard for a week or two and then settle in and see where things go.  I think fair value on the markets for a 4-5 month recession is probably around S&P 2800.  So we could see a 200 point bounce off a recessionary bottom that would get us back to where we are now.

This is likely to all be completely wrong, but it's how I think markets are likely to take the next couple of weeks, and a huge assumption is that the coronavirus situation peaks over the next 4-6 weeks in most countries due to relatively effective quarantines."

&#x200B;

>Where are the international students going to go? If they can't go home because their home country has the coronavirus, where does Rutgers expect them to go?

Surely they will make arrangements for this, such as allowing these students stay in university housing or provide financial support to those living off campus. 

>\- Rutgers might also be making the decision based on profit. Think of it like this, if Rutgers doesn't have to serve food at the dining halls or keep the buildings clean and running and pay for electricity, they can make a huge amount of profit.

That's not how making a profit works. Rutgers still has to pay all those employees and keep the lights on. Closing down the university does not mean they are making more profit. 

>\- Having students stay at home is putting their own family members at risk. Most likely when students are home they will be interacting with older people, such as grandparents, or even younger children. Our age group is mostly unaffected by the coronavirus in the sense that with our immune system it is rarely ever deadly.

I would argue that having commuter students going back and forth each day will put other family members at risk compared to having them stay home completely. I could be wrong about this. 

>\- How are older professors who don't know how to use technology going to teach their classes online? I can't imagine the mess that will be.

They'll figure it out. Eventually. 

>\- Having students stay home is only going to spread the virus somewhere else, it's not preventing anything technically speaking. Yes, students will be interacting with less people overall, but the range of locations they will be traveling to might make things worse in the long run.

Having students stay home would decrease exposure of students in large gatherings. Yes, students could be travelling to other places on their own time, but then it's not the university's responsibility anymore. These students will have made that decision on their own. 

>\- I believe the closing of the school is a decision based on fear and not logic. The coronavirus is a sensational topic on the news that breeds fear, but factually speaking there are far worse things we should actually be worried about.

A month ago, I would have agreed with this statement. However, I believe the circumstances have changed. The situation has become more and more concerning. Schools in New York have switched to online and even Princeton did."

While unchecked spread from Wuhan travel would have led to 9,484 cases of coronavirus in the U.S. by March 1, the researchers found, even a 25% reduction in transmissibility would have dropped that number to 1,043.*"

When I got there, they did a flu test, which requires sticking a swab in your nose and angling for your brain. This nurse was effective, and when she was done, my nose started bleeding profusely. Nevertheless, the doctor came back and said my test was positive. I let my work know and told them I'd be back the next week (today).

Little did I know my boss is terrified of all illnesses because of Coronavirus and told me that I must quarantine for the sooner of: (1) two weeks or; (2) until I could bring him a letter from a doctor showing that I was negative for Coronavirus. My career is the type where my work doesn't get done by someone else if I'm not there, it just stacks up until I come back. Desperately, I write to the doctor begging for a note to return and continue working from home.

I'm on the weekly work conference call when the doctor beeps in. Frantically, I put the conference call on hold and pick up the doctor's call. She asks if the flu test was a presumptive positive or actually positive and I'm in the middle of telling her I don't know - the doctor said it was positive but my nose started bleeding so badly I have no idea if the test would even come out right - and my coworkers start screaming, ""Whoa! Are you talking to us?!"" and ""This sounds personal!!""

I then noticed my phone had only one line on - my work line - and mortified, I try to explain. The doctor beeps back in and said she is sorry the call dropped; she was on her cell in a dead zone. She can't test me for coronavirus; she has no tests. Therefore, she can't write a letter saying I'm negative.

Maybe the quarantine is good; I certainly can't face my coworkers right now anyway.

How are y'alls days going?

TL;dr: Answered a call from doctor while on work call. Doctor's phone dropped the call and I was dumped mid- conference call mid-sentence describing my bloody nose to my coworkers who are already panicked about coronavirus."

We have made zero real efforts towards containment while other states are doing everything they can to ensure testing and tracing of patients gets done.

Sorry for the long winded rant, but I have been closely following the situation as I have elderly parents with pre existing conditions.

The number of coronavirus cases in Massachusetts has risen to 41, state health officials announced Monday.

The number was up from 28 on Sunday. No one has died from the disease in the state.

The new numbers included 32 cases that were linked to¬†a company meeting of biotech giant Biogen in Boston late last month, the Department of Public Health said in an online posting. Another four cases were travel-related, while five cases were under investigation.

In 4 of the 41 cases, the infected person was hospitalized, the DPH said.

The new numbers were announced as word arrived Monday of cancellations of gathering of all kinds in Massachusetts, including lucrative Boston conventions with thousands of attendees whose spending would have bolstered the economy.



The annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) will be held virtually instead, through Wednesday. The conference draws about 4,000 attendees each year, said Mark Aurigemma, a convention spokesman.

The annual Directions conference, hosted by the International Data Corporation for about 1,000 analysts and scheduled to begin Tuesday, has also been canceled. The conference said it will be live-streaming the keynote addresses.

The Cognitive Neuroscience 2020 conference, slated to run from Saturday to next Tuesday, will be held virtually. Organizers were expecting approximately 1,500 attendees, said Lisa M.P. Munoz, a spokeswoman for the society.

Other cancellations included: Boston University‚Äôs ‚ÄúPower of Narrative‚Äù conference for journalists (which is co-sponsored by the Globe) scheduled for March 20-22, which was postponed until next year, and Harvard‚Äôs ‚ÄúWeCode‚Äù conference, for women engineers.

‚ÄúI think that it is a going to be a major blow for the year, and also extend into 2021,‚Äù said David O‚ÄôDonnell, spokesman for the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau. ‚ÄúWe know that this will impact the travel industry probably for a couple of years.‚Äù



The Seafood Expo North America, one of the biggest trade shows in Boston, has¬†already been postponed. The event, scheduled for March 15-17, was expected to draw some 18,000 attendees to the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.

Despite the¬†growing concern about the coronavirus spreading across the nation and across the world, a number of major conferences taking place in the next few weeks are proceeding as planned, including the New England Cannabis Convention with an estimated 21,000 attendees and the National Restaurant Association New England Food Show with an estimated 8,000 attendees.

‚ÄúRestaurants are open for business and so are we,‚Äù the Food Show website reads.

Ace Comic Con Northeast will still take place on March 20 to March 22 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, but the organizers said they were ‚Äúcontinuing to closely monitor the situation"" and instituted some new rules.

During photo opportunities and autograph sessions, for example, Ace Universe said in a Web posting, handshakes, hugs, requests to hold props, and other physical contact will not be permitted. Celebrity guests will not accept gifts, letters or cards. All fans must use hand sanitizer before photo opportunities or autograph sessions. All surface areas will also be cleaned every 30 minutes.

‚ÄúACE Universe wants to assure everyone of the precautions we are taking to ensure a safe weekend at ACE Comic Con Northeast,‚Äù the organizers said.

In addition to conventions, various Massachusetts arts events are also being canceled.

The New England Folk Festival, which says it draws 2,500 attendees to Acton from around the world and features more than 1,000 performers, said it was also canceling its April 24-26 gathering due to coronavirus concerns.

‚ÄúSometimes things change with alarming speed, and we are reduced to hoping that our heads would stop spinning. With great sadness, I must report that the NEFFA Board has decided to cancel the 2020 NEFFA Festival,‚Äù Janet Yeracaris, president of the New England Folk Festival Association, said on the group‚Äôs website.

The Brookline Symphony said it would¬†cancel its 10th anniversary performance on Saturday and Sunday¬†‚Äúin order to protect our musicians & audience.‚Äù

More than 110,000 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in countries worldwide, including more than 500 US cases reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The US cases have been reported from 34 states plus New York City and Washington, D.C. Nineteen people have died from the disease, 18 of them in Washington state and one in California, a CDC official said at a news briefing Monday.

The 41 cases announced by the DPH Monday included 23 males and 18 females. Here are the counties the patients were from and the number of cases in each county: Berkshire (5), Middlesex (15), Norfolk (10), Suffolk (10), and Worcester (1)."

The government extends to all Italy the measures launched in the night between Saturday and Sunday for Lombardy and for 14 provinces: it will only be possible to move for ""proven work needs or situations of necessity"" or ""health reasons""  


EDIT: 

 The government extends the measures already active in Lombardy and in 14 other provinces relating to the **Coronavirus emergency** to all regions . These measures, launched [with a decree on the night between Saturday and Sunday](https://www.corriere.it/politica/20_marzo_07/coronavirusin-lombardia-si-potra-entrare-uscire-solo-gravi-motivi-chiuse-discoteche-palestre-impianti-sci-0478cd9c-609a-11ea-8d61-438e0a276fc4.shtml) , provide for the **prohibition of movement except for ""proven work reasons"" or ""serious family or health needs""** . The whole country is therefore made safe to try to stop the virus race, which has infected - as of March 9, according to data provided by the Civil Protection - 9,172 people, 463 of whom died (724 the recovered, over 700 in intensive care: [all the data here](https://www.corriere.it/salute/malattie_infettive/20_marzo_09/bollettino-coronavirus-9-marzo-regione-dati-provincia-ff355794-621d-11ea-9897-5c6f48cf812d.shtml) ).  


Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, speaking a few moments before Prime Minister **Conte**, said that ""all of Italy (will be) like Lombardy, (we are going) towards a new squeeze"". ""There is a progressive homogenization of the rules throughout the national territory,"" said the Minister for Local Self-Government Francesco Boccia, ""and this guarantees the State's interventions"".  


Starting from the signing of the decree - which according to sources consulted by the *Courier* will take place in the next few hours - anyone who has to move from one Municipality to another must have a justification and present a self-certification for the check.  


The methods for self-certifying the reasonableness of one's move [were defined on Monday](https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_marzo_09/coronavirus-l-autocertificazione-la-zona-sicurezza-modulo-spostarsi-lombardia-14-province-ab3b9d86-61ed-11ea-9897-5c6f48cf812d.shtml) : a form is required (download it [here](https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_marzo_09/autocertificazione-coronavirus-modulo-ministero-dell-interno-scaricare-c436f1a4-61f3-11ea-9897-5c6f48cf812d.shtml)) to be shown when checking. Those who cannot download and print it can copy the text and take the declaration with them. Those who must always make the same movement can use a single form specifying that it is a fixed-rate commitment. The same method also applies to those with family needs that repeat themselves daily or at fixed deadlines and therefore can indicate the frequency of movements without the need to use different modules. For example, those who must move between the municipalities to reach their children or other relatives to assist or for health-related commitments. If you are stopped you can make a declaration that the law enforcement agencies will transcribe but on which they can also make subsequent checks. It is up to the citizen to prove that he has told the truth.

Temp checks are considered by health experts to be ineffective. [This article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/why-airport-screening-wont-stop-spread-coronavirus) explains:  

> Exit and entry screening may look reassuring, but experience with other diseases shows it‚Äôs exceedingly rare for screeners to detect infected passengers. Just last week, eight passengers who later tested positive for COVID-19 arrived in Shanghai from Italy and passed the airport screeners unnoticed, for example. And even if screeners do find the occasional case, it has almost no impact on the course of an outbreak."

Yes and no. Hand sanitizer can help protect you from coronavirus, but it should not be considered your first line of defense against COVID-19. ‚ÄúHand washing with soap and water and scrubbing for at least 20 seconds is recommended, but a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol is the best alternative,‚Äù says Richard Watkins, M.D., infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at Northeast Ohio Medical University.

Coronaviruses are ‚Äúenveloped viruses‚Äù explains David Cennimo, M.D., assistant professor of medicine-pediatrics infectious disease at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.

The coronavirus has been gripping the F1 world for several weeks. Where the winter tests started in Barcelona on 19 February, there wasn't much to worry about yet.

&#x200B;

F1 GP Australia and Bahrain continue

&#x200B;

The Australian Grand Prix will continue, including fans in the stands. The Grand Prix of Bahrain will also continue, as the organization announced last weekend, but without fans.

&#x200B;

The Grand Prix in Vietnam would get its debut but it remains to be seen if this race will continue. Chase Carey would fly to Vietnam immediately after the Grand Prix in Melbourne to check the state of affairs and to come to solutions with the local government.

&#x200B;

It is known that many team members prefer not to go to Vietnam because in the villages around the circuit many people are infected with the coronavirus.

Abiteboul is afraid

&#x200B;

All shipments of stuff from the Formula 1 teams are now in Melbourne. Several drivers are currently on the plane or have just arrived. Most team members also arrive today or tomorrow, something Cyril Abiteboul is worried about.

&#x200B;

The Renault team boss was asked by Canal Plus about the corona virus situation: ""I am worried and quite scared. I'm sending my staff on the road right now, they're all in planes and other public transport. Who knows what will happen then, maybe someone will get infected with the coronavirus, and then? I think Formula One is thinking too lightly about this and being lax about it.""

&#x200B;

""We have to be responsible, but the sport should also take responsibility. I want us to race but I don't want to take any risk.""

&#x200B;

If everything goes according to plan Daniel Ricciardo and Esteban Ocon will start in Melbourne next Sunday during the new F1 season. Next Wednesday, however, the team will first unveil its colours for 2020 on the car.

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
Michael V. Drake, MD
President

Dear Members of the Ohio State Community:
The university has been monitoring closely the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) and providing regular updates to you as the situation evolves. I have convened a task force of senior leadership and subject matter experts who are meeting around the clock and are focused on our university‚Äôs preparations and response.
We continue to align our recommendations with and follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and other city, state and federal agencies.
While there are no campus-associated cases of COVID-19, we know that there are at least three confirmed cases in the state of Ohio, and we expect that there will be more. We are being proactive in an effort to prevent illness and continue the important work of the university. I understand that our policy guidelines will cause measurable disruption, but the risk of not acting outweighs the inconvenience of these temporary measures. The safety of our campus community is always our top priority. Your cooperation and collaboration will help to ensure an appropriate response across our institution to this rapidly changing matter. Thank you for that.
One of the best ways to prevent the spread of viral illness is to minimize the circumstances in which individuals may interact and transmit disease.
Below are a number of updates related to classes, work arrangements, travel and campus events that will allow us to continue the education of our students while protecting our community.
Guidance for faculty and students regarding classroom teaching
We are suspending face-to-face instruction in lectures, discussion sections, seminars and other similar classroom settings and moving to virtual instruction, effective immediately and through at least Monday, March 30. We are evaluating classroom experiences such as laboratory and performance classes, and the university will provide specific guidance this week. We will reevaluate these guidelines on an ongoing basis and share updates or modifications as more information becomes available.
While completing classes virtually, students may choose to return to their permanent place of residence or return to campus, where appropriate social distancing and enhanced preventative public health and hygiene measures will be actively encouraged.
We urge all students to make the choice that is best for their own personal situations.
Telecommuting opportunities for faculty and staff
The university is also preparing plans for telecommuting opportunities, where appropriate, for faculty and staff during this time. Managers are expected to be flexible in allowing those employees who are able to do so to work from home. More information about telecommuting will be available from Human Resources in the coming days. The Wexner Medical Center will communicate with clinical faculty and employees regarding this option.
Human Resources guidance for managers and supervisors
Information about COVID-19 reporting, employee-leave management and associated workplace issues will be available from Human Resources in the coming days.
Travel
Effective immediately and until further notice, all university-sponsored international travel is suspended. This includes new travel as well as any currently booked trips between now and April 20. We will reevaluate these guidelines and share updates as more information becomes available.
The previously announced restrictions of university-sponsored travel to China, Italy, Iran and South Korea, which currently are under Level 3 warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, remain in effect through at least April 20. Personal travel to these countries should be reported to: travelreporting@osumc.edu. Additional information about how to report travel is available on the university‚Äôs coronavirus website: https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/features/coronavirus.
University-sponsored domestic air travel will be limited to business essential travel and will be approved on an as-needed basis. A process for requesting and approval of domestic travel will be shared shortly. This includes new travel as well as any currently booked trips between now and April 20. We will reevaluate these guidelines and share updates as more information becomes available.
The university will work on an individual basis with students who are currently on university-sponsored international or domestic travel and need assistance with returning early. For international travel, contact the Office of International Affairs Risk Management at 614-292-6677. For domestic travel, email studentlife@osu.edu.
Travelers returning from Level 3 warning countries are required to observe a 14-day period of self-quarantine and monitoring. During this period, you are not permitted to come to work, attend class or participate in any other campus or community activities. The university does not have the capacity to provide self-quarantine locations on campus for students. Students needing to self-quarantine will be required to return to their permanent home residences or self-quarantine in their off-campus apartments. Students who reside in university housing and are unable to return to a home residence should contact University Housing in the Office of Student Life at housing@osu.edu.
Events
No new, non-essential events will be scheduled on campus through April 20.
We encourage event organizers for scheduled non-essential events occurring on campus between now and April 20 to immediately evaluate whether these events should continue in person.
We will continue to evaluate events and will share plans prior to April 20 to either end the restrictions early or, if needed, extend them.
As mentioned, the situation is evolving daily. All guidelines are subject to change as emerging events warrant. I appreciate your understanding and continued cooperation during these changing times. I also want to express my thanks to the individuals and teams who have worked many hours to implement plans that will help keep our community safe.
We will continue to monitor regularly and make adjustments as needed with the well-being of our university community top of mind. Please check our website for updates and other information. Questions can be addressed to coronavirus@osumc.edu.
Thank you for all of your efforts to promote a safe and healthy campus community at The Ohio State University.
Sincerely,
Michael V. Drake, MD

Then, about three weeks ago I moved to Washington State to begin a new job in Kirkland. What are the odds? Because I'm so new at my job, I'm reluctant to rock the boat - but, to answer your question: no, people are not taking it seriously at all. No one is wearing masks outside because the government has told us they're ineffective. I've even seen people mocked in public for wearing them.

The fact that everyone seems to be getting sick in the office, is an unspoken dilemma - and really shouldn't be downplayed, given the circumstances. 

I'm fairly sure the virus continues to spread beyond the third/fourth day of symptoms. At my workplace, the expectation seems to be that you take as little sick time as possible, and return to work asap because projects can't wait. Also, I'm a new employee so I haven't even accrued much sick/personal leave. If I get sick, I still have to pay my bills, like everyone else. 

At this point, if the virus has been around my office for the past week, week+1/2, it's only a matter of time before we are all symptomatic. I hear most people clearing their throats or outright coughing throughout a given workday. Some outright find excuses, like, 'oh .. O\_O .. it must be my allergies'.  I think we're all waiting for the government to take us by the hand and say, ok, it's now time to quarantine! Everyone inside, please!   ... we aren't being proactive; we aren't even being reactive. I expect the situation to be very grave in the next week - 2 weeks."

It's possible that COVID-19 isn‚Äôt as fatal as most people think. And stockpiling hand sanitizer and masks could hurt people who are truly at risk: the elderly and those with weak immune systems.

‚ÄúKids and adults have done extremely well in terms of recovery so far,‚Äù said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine doctor at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital in Boston.

While some studies peg the death rate to 3.4%, experts expect to see this rate decrease as the health care system starts finding milder cases.

‚ÄúWhat I was able to find by looking at a few other data sources, rather than just the big flashy numbers, was that there‚Äôs actually a lot of reason to be reassured that the numbers are a lot lower,‚Äù said Faust.

There‚Äôs a large epidemic of coronavirus anxiety,‚Äù said Schaffner. ""I think [people] ought to take a deep breath and spend a little more time planning what to do if the coronavirus really came into their community and they had to undergo what we call social distancing, which is separating themselves from other people.

Coronaviruses have genomic similarities and there are a few articles showing not only the high percentage of it being a bat but even higher it being a pangolin.  The WHO can't confirm it 100% and neither is anyone else because, as per usual, you can't speak out about anyone on the planet except for the USA and Trump.  You watched the news recently... all of the blame game now is on Trump and no one is talking about China anymore.

Sorry for sounding aggressive, just having one of those days... didn't mean to snap at ya but with China covering this shit up you won't get a definitive answer any time soon but genomic processing doesn't lie and with a 99% likelihood the DNA came from a Pangolin... it's not 100% but it's sure close enough for me considering all of the other crap that has come out of China."

The CFR is your chance of dying given that you have been diagnosed with the virus. This rate is somewhere between 1-3%.

2020-03-09,Embowaf,Coronavirus,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffqiyn/daily_discussion_post_march_09_questions_images/fk2g77m/,"Extremely likely that you would.

First of all, despite how people seem to be acting, even if you don't do anything to protect yourself you aren't at all assured to get it.

Historically, the worst outbreaks we've seen have been things like the plague, that infected around 30-60% of people in the impacted regions, when people had almost zero understanding of how diseases spread. Or maybe spanish flu in 1918, when we understood more about it but sanitation was poor, infected around 27% of the world. Or modern flus, which usually infect 10ish% of people in the world.

Coronavirus is more like a cold (not in severity, but in that other coronavirus are a less common cause of the common cold, with rhinovirus being the more common cause). But the viruses that cause the common cold have hundreds of strains, which wax and wane. But even though most people get a cold or two per year, it's not the same strain that does it.

So. In that sense, you're probably more likely that you don't get it, rather than getting it.

Second, if you DO get it, at 18, your chances of dying are pretty low. Likely around 0.2%, based on the data around there so far. Even in a ""medical care collapses and you have to weather this alone"" scenario, it's pretty unlikely it would kill you.

That doesn't mean this isn't a big deal. But anyone making it out to be the apocalypse is probably wrong too."

Lee is the founder of the **Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony** (SCJ), a South Korean Christian group, that has been **accused of being a religious cult**, who has claimed that Jesus Christ appeared before him as a ""bright heavenly figure"". He has been accused by the press of being a ""false prophet"".

> **On 22 February 2020, South Korea confirmed 231 of their 433 cases of COVID-19 were from within the Shincheonji sect.** Lee called the coronavirus a ""devil's deed"" intended to stop the sect's growth, but he canceled all gatherings of his faith. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the practice of gathering followers in close quarters for religious services may have contributed to the fast spread of the disease.

> On 1 March 2020, Seoul mayor Park Won-soon announced that the **Seoul City Government had made a criminal complaint about Lee**, asking for an investigation into him and twelve others connected to the sect **on charges of murder and violations of the Disease Control Act**, citing their **negligence in preventing an outbreak** among their parishioners and their **refusal to cooperate with the government** throughout the crisis.

The nail in the coffin was that the drastic decrease in travel means that there is a drastic reduction in the consumption of oil, meaning oil prices have dropped as well. OPEC, the countries responsible for producing the majority of oil, met to to try and establish a set market price, but Russia and Saudi Arabia said ""fuck that"" and started selling at their own prices, sparking a full on price war.

First thing we have to talk about is the increased updates that the Ontario website is giving out. Previously the website only updated once during weekdays, now they are updating twice a day every single day. So credit where credit is due, good on Tim for putting in the extra hours to keep us updated. 

The next thing is the addition of the new cases table on the website. Now you can see the information of the new cases like age, gender, location, hospital, transmission type, and status. Really great table to make such information easy to view. Unfortunately this only affects new cases, so it doesn't affect previous cases but if you look through my previous posts, I've given information on each case. 

While the table on the website itself says there's only 30 positive cases, that portion was only updated in this morning, below you'll see the update in the afternoon where we have another positive case. Going up to 31. 

So we first start from [last night] (https://news.ontario.ca/mohltc/en/2020/03/ontario-confirms-new-positive-case-of-covid-19-2.html) where we have the addition of two new positive cases. The first is a woman in her 60s who came back from France. She presented herself to Scarborough Health Network - General Site and is now in self-isolation. The second is a man in his 60s who returned from Washington D.C. and. He presented himself to North York General Hospital and is now in self-isolation. 

Moving on to today, we have four additional cases. However all four seem stable and are all in self-isolation. The first is a man in his 50s who came back from Germany and presented himself to Brampton Civic Hospital. The second is a man in his 80s who came back from Iran and presented himself to North York General Hospital.

The third case is a woman in her 70s who came back from Iran and presented herself to North York General Hospital. The last case is a woman in her 30s who was actually infected through H2H transmission and presented herself to Brampton Civic Hospital. It is unsure who she was infected by as there was no information provided for that.

This translates into middle and lower class workers having higher debt and decreased savings(not to mention the swing towards a considerable portion of new jobs created being ""casual"".)

This leads to not being able to afford to take time off work (support themselves for two weeks in isolation) . Which will make the long-term outcomes considerably worse across the board.

I think it is valid to criticize the government for continuing to ignore or minimise these issues over the last 6-7 years, leaving us probably a little more vulnerable a position then we could have achieved."

Pros

1. BoC already lowered rates, and will probably lower further, heating up the housing market.
2. GoC will probably respond with fiscal stimulus, and Ottawa tends to be more competent at stuff like this than American or European governments.

Cons

1. Canada's finance & oil heavy economy will suffer particularly in the present set of circumstances, leading to higher unemployment and higher default rates.
   1. Mortgage arrears are at a historic low, but household debt is high, presenting a mixed picture.
2. Immigration may slow, as part of a general slowdown in human movement due to the coronavirus. Ottawa may also be politically forced to cut down on immigration targets.

The virus epidemic and the ensuing stock market carnage, so far, **isn't the repeat of 2008** as some people claim. This is an external shock against a generally robust economy (at least in North America), not a bomb going off in the very heart of the financial economy like in 2008. Having said that, governments and central banks have less at disposal to combat the next downturn, and a failure to come to grips with this virus will have extremely far-reaching consequences for the economy.

So far, China, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore appear to have figured out a way to keep the virus not-so-endemic, and therefore not too lethal. Italy has been somewhat complacent and is now paying the price; France and the US unfortunately looks like they are headed in the Italian trajectory (especially the US with their Idiot-in-Chief). Germany and UK seem to be better at this. Relative lack of cases in Southeast Asia suggests that warm, humid weather does curb transmission somewhat, which is hopeful - but experts have warned against banking on the summer to bring this to a halt.

Long story short, I would expect more turmoil in the coming weeks, and more fiscal & monetary measures to help the economy, while the market, due to fear, takes its time to respond. But I do not expect any deep and permanent correction; not even during the GFC did this happen."

if you have a job that has you working on site, or in large groups, you may find a lot of your work scaled back in the coming months.

depending on what state you live in (if you're in the US), you may not have access to reliable testing for some time.

if you live in a state w/o paid sick leave, your risk of coming into contact w the virus from someone who is working thru it is high.

if you live in the US, millions of your uninsured neighbors (like me) are deep in our anxiety about wtf we would do if we got sick and had no way to see a doctor for testing, let alone treatment.

economically speaking, it's going to get worse before it gets better. wouldn't look for a lot of reliable insight coming from the US gov't, since it's fully in the paws of a deranged despot. but WHO has a lot of good info as does r/Coronavirus

## The government is ready to extend the measures launched in the night between Saturday and Sunday for Lombardy and for 14 provinces to all of Italy: it will only be possible to ""demonstrate proven work needs or situations of necessity"" or ""health reasons""

 The government is preparing to extend the measures already active in Lombardy and in 14 other provinces relating to the **Coronavirus emergency** to all regions . These measures, launched [with a decree on the night between Saturday and Sunday](https://www.corriere.it/politica/20_marzo_07/coronavirusin-lombardia-si-potra-entrare-uscire-solo-gravi-motivi-chiuse-discoteche-palestre-impianti-sci-0478cd9c-609a-11ea-8d61-438e0a276fc4.shtml) , provide for the **prohibition of movement except for ""proven work reasons"" or ""serious family or health needs""** . The whole country would therefore be made safe to try to stop the virus race, which infected - as of March 9, according to data provided by the Civil Protection - 9,172 people, 463 of whom died (724 the recovered, over 700 in intensive care: [all the data here](https://www.corriere.it/salute/malattie_infettive/20_marzo_09/bollettino-coronavirus-9-marzo-regione-dati-provincia-ff355794-621d-11ea-9897-5c6f48cf812d.shtml) ).  


Starting from the signing of the decree - which according to sources consulted by the *Courier*will happen in the next few hours - anyone who has to move from one municipality to another must have a justification and submit a self-certification for the check.  


The methods for self-certifying the reasonableness of one's move [were defined on Monday](https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_marzo_09/coronavirus-l-autocertificazione-la-zona-sicurezza-modulo-spostarsi-lombardia-14-province-ab3b9d86-61ed-11ea-9897-5c6f48cf812d.shtml) : a form is required (download it [here](https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_marzo_09/autocertificazione-coronavirus-modulo-ministero-dell-interno-scaricare-c436f1a4-61f3-11ea-9897-5c6f48cf812d.shtml)) to be shown when checking. Those who cannot download and print it can copy the text and take the declaration with them. Those who must always make the same movement can use a single form specifying that it is a fixed-rate commitment. The same method also applies to those with family needs that are repeated daily or at fixed deadlines and therefore can indicate the frequency of travel without the need to use different modules. For example, those who must move between the municipalities to reach their children or other relatives to assist or for health-related commitments.

My girlfriend has been in Oahu, Hawaii for a week and her whole family (3) started getting symptoms consistent with covid-19. They were supposed to fly back to California on Saturday but their flight was delayed. Even with illness they continued to move around the island and spent considerable amount of time in Honolulu. Her sister got it first and had the worst symptoms, so I urged them to get her screened for Coronavirus.

At the time I only thought her sister was sick because my girlfriend was keeping the truth from me, but they called kaiser and brought her to the ER / urgent care / after hours clinic, not sure. They took her temperature, swabbed her and told her she didn't have the flu or coronavirus. But it sounds like the staff made this determination after ONLY AN HOUR. I called Kaiser and talked to a healthcare worker in Oahu who agreed with me that there was very little chance they actually tested her.

My girlfriend also bought the ""masks don't work"" myth and they flew home today, all thinking there was no way they could all have it because her sister was ""tested"". My girlfriend got mad at me yesterday for questioning any of this. I'm in fucking disbelief.

I work in a hospital in Sydney, in the finance department. We have several concerns right now, finance wise.

  - more beds will be required if we have corona admissions- most screenings at this point are outpatients

 - if schools close here like they are in some places, our workforce will crumble- that will mean not only short staff, but we will need to pay these staff members whichever leave they choose to take, and then replace them with expensive casuals

 - we are budgeted only for X amount of patients per year- treating more patients will skew our funding/budget, which will impact all sorts, staffing levels, supplies, etc.

 - we are already struggling with staff being self quarantined- we are paying these staff members leave, running short at work, or replacing them with another staff member (usually a casual), so effectively paying 2 people for one job


Another huge ramification, that doesn‚Äôt actually affect the finance side of things, is increased wait times due to every Tom Dick and Harry coming in for a screening"

2020-03-09,Unanimous_vote,vancouver,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/ffwef6/surrey_elementary_school_confirms_connection_to/fk1cp0e/,"Panicking and proactivity are two different things. One is being ignorant and the other is being wise.

So far we have yet to find the source of infection for the first incident of community infection. They detected the first community infection and who she herself infected (elderly home in North Van), but they have yet to find the source to begin with. This means there is an infectious individual still running around infecting others. By logic, its almost a guarantee there are other undetected infections.

There is no good in panicking, but it might be wise to do something similar to Quebec -- set up testing centers so they can detect infections sooner.

Ignoring the threat or downplaying it is just the opposite spectrum of panicking -- it's just as bad. We should give coronavirus the attention it deserves, no more, no less."

This restriction has been changed, so there are a lot of places across the country who now have the ability to develop their LDTs without a lengthy approval process by the FDA.

Moral of the story is that hopefully we will be able to get more testing soon.  The only downside to this is there is likely to be quite a few false-positives, which means there will be increased panic and people who have to quarantine themselves and miss work for no actual reason."

And I won't keep my son isolated.  Because even if I did, it's not like coronavirus is going to go away in a month, and we can't hide forever.  So I say, live life, do our best, and if we get sick, fight it.  Do good self care and keep as healthy as possible in advance, so we have the strength to beat it when the time comes."
