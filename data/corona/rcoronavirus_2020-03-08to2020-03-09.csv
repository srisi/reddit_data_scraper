....

>ACU chairman Matt Schlapp however told The Washington Post that he interacted with the infected person at the event -- and while the timeline is unclear, Schlapp shook Trump's hand on the stage on the last day of the conference. 

This will be an interesting story to follow in the coming days.  There were a lot of powerful people at CPAC and many of them are in the higher-risk age groups."

European population is very old. 
20% of European population is over 65 y/o. In contrast only 15% of Americans, 9% of Chinese or 2% of Nigerians


As such people in critical condition in Europe will be way more (doubled) than that of China. Also total death rate in Europe is expected to be higher because the amount of elders.


China didn't report a huge ""critical condition"" numbers because  China's susceptible population is half compared to that of Italy, Spain, France or Germany. The European Union will have double as many critical than China if containment fails. The healthcare system in Europe will be probably on the verge of collapse due to this point (italy is already prioritising some critical patients as not everyone can be treated, focusing on the younger ones and probability of survival). On the other side, African countries' elder population is very low and that will help if it spreads there."

\- Encouraged self-quarantine: Communities assigned people to each local residential area to carry out essential daily tasks such as purchasing food, water, drugs, etc. to minimize uncontrolled contact between people.

\- Community level quarantine: Forbid all unnecessary inter-community travels to avoid potential infection clusters from expanding before confirmation.

\- Ark hospitals: Wuhan created 10+ ark hospitals from buildings that have large in-door spaces such as stadiums or large meeting halls to house patients with light symptoms, in order to 1. allow faster responses in case symptoms turn severe, and 2. minimize the risks of these people infecting other healthy individuals.

\- Makeshift treatment centers: namely those 2 hospitals built within 10 days (it actually took longer than that but you get the point). These hospitals, along with ICUs of other hospitals, are meant to house patients with severe/critical symptoms so they would have life support if needed and better care in general, while remaining in a fully quarantined area.

I don't know if Italy did all these things, especially the first 3, but if it didn't, then it's only reasonable that it will see worse numbers than those from China."

I apologize for the late warning)

English translation by 'mcgianni' on [/r/medicine](https://np.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/) (NP-linked, please do not participate if you are a non-medical professional):

>«In one of the non-stop e-mails that I receive from my hospital administration on a more than daily basis, there was a paragraph on ""how to be responsible on social media"", with some recommendations that we all can agree on. After thinking for a long time if and what to write about what's happening here, I felt that silence was not responsible. I will therefore try to convey to lay-people, those who are more distant from our reality, what we are experiencing in Bergamo during these Covid-19 pandemic days. I understand the need not to panic, but when the message of the danger of what is happening is not out, and I still see people ignoring the recommendations and people who gather together complaining that they cannot go to the gym or play soccer tournaments, I shiver. I also understand the economic damage and I am also worried about that. After this epidemic, it will be hard to start over.

>Still, beside the fact that we are also devastating our national health system from an economic point of view, I want to point out that the public health damage that is going to invest the country is more important and I find it nothing short of ""chilling"" that new quarantine areas requested by the Region has not yet been established for the municipalities of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro (I would like to clarify that this is purely personal opinion). I myself looked with some amazement at the reorganization of the entire hospital in the previous week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activities interrupted, intensive care unit freed to create as many beds as possible. Containers arriving in front of the emergency room to create diversified routes and avoid infections. All this rapid transformation brought in the hallways of the hospital an atmosphere of surreal silence and emptiness that we did not understand, waiting for a war that had yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would never come with such ferocity (I open a parenthesis: all this was done in the shadows, and without publicity, while several newspapers had the courage to say that private health care was not doing anything).

>I still remember my night shift a week ago spent without any rest, waiting for a call from the microbiology department. I was waiting for the results of a swab taken from the first suspect case in our hospital, thinking about what consequences it would have for us and the hospital. If I think about it, my agitation for one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I have seen what is happening. Well, the situation is now nothing short of dramatic. No other words come to mind. The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. One after the other, these unfortunate people come to the emergency room. They have far from the complications of a flu. Let's stop saying it's a bad flu. In my two years working in Bergamo, I have learned that the people here do not come to the emergency room for no reason. They did well this time too. They followed all the recommendations given: a week or ten days at home with a fever without going out to prevent contagion, but now they can't take it anymore. They don't breathe enough, they need oxygen. Drug therapies for this virus are few.

>The course mainly depends on our organism. We can only support it when it can't take it anymore. It is mainly hoped that our body will eradicate the virus on its own, let's face it. Antiviral therapies are experimental on this virus and we learn its behavior day after day. Staying at home until the symptoms worsen does not change the prognosis of the disease. Now, however, that need for beds in all its drama has arrived. One after another, the departments that had been emptied are filling up at an impressive rate. The display boards with the names of the sicks, of different colors depending on the department they belong to, are now all red and instead of the surgical procedure, there is the diagnosis, which is always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Now, tell me which flu virus causes such a rapid tragedy.

>Because that's the difference (now I get a little technical): in classical flu, besides that it infects much less population over several months, cases are complicated less frequently: only when the virus has destroyed the protective barriers of our airways and as such it allows bacteria (which normally resident in the upper airways) to invade the bronchi and lungs, causing a more serious disease. Covid 19 causes a banal flu in many young people, but in many elderly people (and not only) a real SARS because it invades the alveoli of the lungs directly, and it infects them making them unable to perform their function. The resulting respiratory failure is often serious and after a few days of hospitalization, the simple oxygen that can be administered in a ward may not be enough. Sorry, but to me, as a doctor, it's not reassuring that the most serious are mainly elderly people with other pathologies. The elderly population is the most represented in our country and it is difficult to find someone who, above 65 years of age, does not take at least a pill for high blood pressure or diabetes.

>I can also assure you that when you see young people who end up intubated in the ICU, pronated or worse, in ECMO (a machine for the worst cases, which extracts the blood, re-oxygenates it and returns it to the body, waiting for the lungs to hopefully heal), all this confidence for your young age goes away. And while there are still people on social media who boast of not being afraid by ignoring the recommendations, protesting that their normal lifestyle habits have ""temporarily"" halted, the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.

The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the emergency room is collapsing. Emergency provisions are issued: help is needed in the emergency room. A quick meeting to learn how the to use to emergency room EHR and a few minutes later I'm already downstairs, next to the warriors on the war front. The screen of the PC with the chief complaint is always the same: fever and respiratory difficulty, fever and cough, respiratory insufficiency etc ... Exams, radiology always with the same sentence: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All needs to be hospitalized. Some already needs to be intubated, and goes to the ICU. For others, however, it is late. ICU is full, and when ICUs are full, more are created. Each ventilator is like gold: those in the operating rooms that have now suspended their non-urgent activity are used and the OR become a an ICU that did not exist before. I found it amazing, or at least I can speak for Humanitas Gavazzeni (where I work), how it was possible to put in place in such a short time a deployment and a reorganization of resources so finely designed to prepare for a disaster of this magnitude. And every reorganization of beds, wards, staff, work shifts and tasks is constantly reviewed day after day to try to give everything and even more. Those wards that previously looked like ghosts are now saturated, ready to try to give their best for the sick, but exhausted. The staff is exhausted. I saw fatigue on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already grueling workloads they had. I have seen people still stop beyond the times they used to stop already, for overtime that was now habitual. I saw solidarity from all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask ""what can I do for you now?"" or ""leave that admission to me, i will take care of it."" Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we are unable to save everyone and the vital signs of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny. There are no more shifts, schedules.

>Social life is suspended for us. I have been separated for a few months, and I assure you that I have always done my best to constantly see my son even on the day after a night shift, without sleeping and postponing sleep until when I am without him, but for almost 2 weeks I have voluntarily not seen neither my son nor my family members for fear of infecting them and in turn infecting an elderly grandmother or relatives with other health problems. I'm happy with some photos of my son that I look at between tears and a few video calls. So you should be patient too, you can't go to the theater, museums or gym. Try to have mercy on that myriad of older people you could exterminate. It is not your fault, I know, but of those who put it in your head that you are exaggerating and even this testimony may seem just an exaggeration for those who are far from the epidemic, but please, listen to us, try to leave the house only to indispensable things. Do not go en masse to make stocks in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are infected. You can go there without a rush. Maybe if you have a normal mask (even those that are used to do certain manual work), put it on. Don't look for ffp2 or ffp3. Those should serve us and we are beginning to struggle to find them. By now we have had to optimize their use only in certain circumstances, as the WHO recently recommended in view of their almost ubiquitous running low. Oh yes, thanks to the shortage of certain protection devices, many colleagues and I are certainly exposed despite all the other means of protection we have. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols. Some infected colleagues also have infected relatives and some of their family members are already struggling between life and death. We are where your fears could make you stay away. Try to make sure you stay away.

>Tell your family members who are elderly or with other illnesses to stay indoors. Bring him the groceries please. We have no alternative. It's our job. Indeed what I do these days is not really the job I'm used to, but I do it anyway and I will like it as long as it responds to the same principles: try to make some sick people feel better and heal, or even just alleviate the suffering and the pain to those who unfortunately cannot heal. I don't spend a lot of words about the people who define us heroes these days and who until yesterday were ready to insult and report us. Both will return to insult and report as soon as everything is over. People forget everything quickly. And we're not even heroes these days. It's our job. We risked something bad every day before: when we put our hands in a belly full of someone's blood we don't even know if they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we do it even though we know they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we stick ourselves during an operation on a patient with HIV and take the drugs that make us vomit all day long for a month. When we read with anguish the results of the blood tests after an accidental needlestick, hoping not to be infected. We simply earn our living with something that gives us emotions. It doesn't matter if they are beautiful or ugly, we just take them home. In the end we only try to make ourselves useful for everyone. Now try to do it too, though: with our actions we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share and share the message. We need to spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy.»

That was the capacity observed by the WHO team in **Wuhan only**. As an entire country, China has demonstrated test kit production of [700,000 per day](http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2020-02/07/c_1125541390.htm), which was 60-70% of the then-maximum production capacity. Note that the 700k number is from February 7 when factories were still calling their workers back from holidays so production by now is conceivably around 1 million per day, possibly more if they have expanded production capacity.

If the world doesn't start mass quarantining, 1 million test kits per day is not enough. It might *just* be enough for one province, won't be enough for the whole country, and definitely not enough for the whole world.

Edit: 
Some other figures that might be interesting:

* China has 2 million test kits warehoused in case of a resurgence
* Current full-body PPE production is 500k/day, up from 20k/day at the beginning of the outbreak
* N95 (or equivalent standard) respirator production is 1.6 million/day, up from 200k at the beginning
* Normal surgical mask production is >100 million/day

I have an interesting anecdote, too. My SO's sister in Shandong was called back to work in late January amidst the CNY holidays. This was very unusual because, one, you don't disturb people's only opportunity of the whole year to be with their family and, two, it was in the middle of an epidemic and you'd want them to stay at home. It turns out she works at a disinfectant manufacturing plant and the provincial government put in a rush order of disinfectant so all the workers had to go back early. This rush order wasn't even *for* the government per se, it was simply the government paying in advance for whoever wanted disinfectant, mostly hospitals."

We need to be taking this more serious then we are. I don’t think most Americans understand that we have to slow the spread so we do not create more critical patients than our hospitals can handle. We need to be ramping up additional space for critical patients NOW (turning other space into temporary hospitals)and recruiting retired doctors and nurses to help.  We may need to also recruit out of other medical specialities to help. They will need rapid training on how to care for this type of patient. And a lot of supplies...

We've been preparing since 2005 (at least), with a stockpile of respiratory inventory kept in warehouses around the country (the stockpile), [tested against scenarios.](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-bio-factsht_stckpile.htm)

PM called it a pandemic last week, to the criticism of some people, saying he had jumped the gun.

Planning for [at least](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fdbvp1/australia_person_to_person_transmission_in/) 25% to be infected in first wave.

Contact tracing and testing everyone - my state of 2mn people has already tested more people than NY city (sorry to kick when down).

3 fever clinics open in Perth on Tuesday, despite that we're yet to find community transmission (but will this week, I'm sure).

---

We have many things flawed in our govt, but for our preparedness here (it will still not be enough), I really feel we can thank the Westminster system and our hard working public servants.

Here, when the head of govt change, the machinations beneath still keep on ticking over in an apolitical manner, only with new directions. They try to provide what we need, with some degree of autonomy.

It's partly why our govt is acting confidently here, on the world stage, they believe we can come off looking at least okay. Which is really reassuring as a citizen, and will shore up votes like nothing before.

Honestly, I really am thankful."

Ironically the bigger risk to China is returning spread from countries they previously infected, not just to Wuhan but nationally. And because of the lengthy asymptomatic carrier phase, this type of spread can be extremely effusive before detection, testing, and confirmation. 


This is not some zero sum game where initial containment = victory. The virus simply has no concept or care of national or regional borders. It will spread back again very rapidly at any opportunity. Once they feel the economic pressures to widely return to normal, they will get a bigger, more comprehensive second wave which will be beyond any practical containment."

Studies have found 72% isopropyl is more effective because it stays on the surface longer before evaporating.

In the case of DIY hand sanitizers, aloe vera gel is used because it acts as a suspension, and an insulator, to keep the alcohol from evaporating long enough to be \[more\] effective. Even still, hand sanitizer doesn't actually kill the advertised ""99.9% of germs"" unless you leave it on your hands for 7+ minutes, in liquid form, before rubbing it in the rest of the way, or wiping it off.

You're actually better off, from a sanitization perspective, to wash your hands using warm water (110F+) and a regular old lye-based bar soap, with 60 seconds lather/scrubbing before rinsing.

Disclaimer: I'm just a guy who has read a bunch of studies on hand sanitizers vs soap.

*Edit: Additional info... 72% isopropyl stays longer because it has higher water content (28% vs the 1% in 99%IPA). Water evaporates slower, as it has a much lower vapor pressure (47.1 torr) than isopropyl alcohol (100 torr) at body temperature (37C), and a lower evaporation (boiling) point, which causes wind displacement, ambient pressure, and additional heat to force the isopropyl to evaporate at body temperature at a rate much higher than water, so when the alcohol contains more water, it evaporates slower. If the ratio of alcohol to water is still high enough, the additional water slows the evaporation rate (by reducing the vapor pressure) and more germs, viruses, etc, will be killed by the alcohol before evaporation can occur.*"

Once the infection was localized to Hubei, other provinces could then send their excess personnel to the hot zone as ordered by the government.  This allows maximum focus at the point of greatest necessity.

Public health response in the US, by contrast, is not something that the national government can just decide.  They can only pump funds into state and municipal governments and trust them to use the resources as they see fit.  Of course, this also means a tendency for local governments to hoard resources against each other.  Especially now that containment has failed and every state is staring down their own outbreaks, no one is going to volunteer their resources for someone else.

I’ve attended one of his lectures on Churchill and, with no cameras present, he presented himself as an incredibly articulate scholar. I bought a couple of his books post lecture and really enjoyed them.

So what he saw was more than 10,000 suspected cases still queued up for PCR testing. Until they are confirmed they cannot be hospitalised. PCR test capacity was still ramping up at the time and it would take many many more days to catch up, potentially late diagnoses might mean even more people dying while waiting in the queue for test.

So he made the call to allow CT image alone to be able to confirm cases as ""clinically diagnosed"". The vast majority of those people in the queue in fact already have CT image done, so it's trivial for a doctor to just look at the image and quickly come to the conclusion, since COVID-19 (and other pneumonia) shows up as a characteristic ""foggy glass"" area in the lung.

So that's why on that date the number of confirmed cases had a crazy jump. He kept the policy like that for several more days until all the backlogs are more or less cleared, then he had them switch back to require PCR test positive to count as confirmed case. By this stage a new lab called ""Fire Eyes"" capable of running 10,000 test a day was completed in Wuhan and in fact have come back with results for many clinical diagnosed cases admitted during the special period. Some of them were actually false positive using CT because they had regular old bacterial pneumonia or flu or something like that, so on the day when the rules returned back to normal there's an unusual ""X number of previous confirmed cases were deducted from the total"".

Lots of people here on reddit never understood the nuances hence you will see plenty of ""can't trust China's number because they changed the diagnosing rules so many times"" still floating around."

In mid-November, I spent some time at Disney World and came down with a severe respiratory illness.  I was tested for Influenza A/B, and Strep (A/B) because my symptoms were:

*  Dry, non-productive cough

That the next day became a 

*  Severe sore throat

That then became a 

*  Fever 

Which on the second day of fever combined with 

*  chills and bodyache.

About 4 days in, I felt pretty decent again but my cough wouldn’t go away.
The next week, my cough was so severe (still dry, but so intense it was making the muscles of my diaphragm sore) that I was struggling to breathe.  Eventually, I could not lay down at night because I felt like I had “something in my lung” — very low in my lungs, like fluid.  I visited the doctor where I had imaging studies.  

Two chest x-rays confirmed pneumonia,  but 3 rounds of antibiotics didn’t treat or assist it (so it was likely viral).  6 weeks after I first became sick, I finally started feeling better. 

Months later, hearing about the symptoms of this virus, I have to wonder if it has been around since prior to its introduction in December in China. 

I’ve been wondering if it hasn’t been quietly circulating the globe for most of winter, until China brought it to attention."

Australians with flu-like symptoms are being told to get tested for the novel coronavirus in an escalation of health advice that threatens to inundate the medical system.

The updated instruction from federal Health Minister Greg Hunt comes as [an 82-year-old Sydney man](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p547x9) was confirmed on Sunday as the third Australian to die with COVID-19. The number of cases nationwide stands at 77, including two Australian Defence Force members who tested positive for the virus on Sunday.

The federal government is preparing to pump more than $3 billion in stimulus funds into the economy to avoid recession.

 Federal health authorities had previously advised that only people who had travelled overseas or had contact with a suspected case of coronavirus and felt unwell should get tested.     

Globally, the virus is spreading, with Italy on Sunday locking down more than 16 million people across the Lombardy region, including in the capital, Milan. The unprecedented step follows China's quarantine of up to 60 million people in Hubei, where the number of daily infections has slowed significantly and draconian restrictions are slowly being lifted.

Mr Hunt said on Sunday that the government would rather people over-test than under-test. ""Even though it can be a little bit of a stress on the system,"" he said. ""If in doubt, get yourself tested.""

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Victorian Minister for Women Gabrielle Williams had earlier urged anyone who had a cough, runny nose or sore throat to stay home and get themselves assessed. More than 10,000 tests for the coronavirus have been administered so far. Figures from the Department of Health show up to 298,000 Australians caught the flu between January and October last year.

The Australian Medical Association has told health authorities to make the advice ""very clear as soon as possible"" as it prepares to roll out a network for GPs to consult patients online amid claims they are under-equipped for a major outbreak. As of Sunday evening, the official notice from the Health Protection Principal Committee, which advises cabinet, encouraged only close contacts or travellers from high risk zones to be tested.

AMA president Dr Tony Bartone said all medical bodies had to ""start acting as one if we're to deal with this threat"" and demanded an apology from the Victorian government after it criticised a doctor for treating patients while he was unaware he had the coronavirus. 

""The \[comments\] are a concern to the frontline medical profession, who have thought about nothing but the wellbeing of the community, putting themselves in the frontline, day after day, during this evolving crisis,"" he said.

The escalation comes as Parliament prepares to face the threat of the virus. Two Defence members tested positive on Sunday. At least one travelled on flights \[QF1509 and VA651\] from Sydney to Canberra on February 28 and MPs and staff are now having their contacts traced to see if any may have contracted the disease.

Mr Hunt said most people would ultimately know somebody affected by the virus as the government prepares for up to $1 billion in funding to treat up to 200,000 patients.

The virus has raced across Europe and the United States. Italy on Sunday implemented travel restrictions in the north in a bid to stop the number of infections climbing past 6000.

 China has seen its infection rate slow to just over 100 a day which could be the key to Australia avoiding a recession as the US looks to stop cases multiplying beyond 500 in Washington state and across the country.

Australia's government is staring down the increasing possibility of a negative quarter and will sacrifice its election promise of a surplus to pump more than $3 billion into the economy.

The measures, to be announced by Thursday, will include investment allowances for businesses and incentives to keep workers in jobs as [Labor calls for the rate of unemployment benefits](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p547xw) to be lifted and for more than 3 million casual workers to be eligible for Newstart if they are forced into quarantine.

Add to shortlist

Health authorities in Hobart on Sunday said a man infected with coronavirus ignored instructions to self-isolate because he did not want to miss his casual shifts at Hobart's Grand Chancellor Hotel.

Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter will lead a national round table in Sydney on Tuesday where measures to help the casual workforce will be discussed.

Labor's health spokesman, Chris Bowen, said Labor would vote through billions of dollars in coronavirus stimulus.

Bern summoned the German ambassador after Berlin stopped exporting protective material to Switzerland.

Francesco Benini
07.03.2020, 23.01 p.m.

Protective suit, protective mask and protective glasses - Germany is blocking material for the fight against the corona virus at the state border.

In Switzerland, the protective masks that help fight the spread of the corona virus are becoming scarce. Now there has been a scandal with Germany because the country is preventing the masks from being exported to Switzerland. As confirmed by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) on request, Switzerland has therefore summoned the German ambassador and protested the export ban.

As the ""NZZ am Sonntag"" found out, a truck belonging to a Swiss company is currently being prevented from traveling to Switzerland by German customs authorities. There are 240,000 protective masks in the truck. He is blocked on the national border. The Seco writes on request that it is in contact with the company concerned. The Office points out that it is not a single case. ""We have information that further transports are blocked,"" spokesman Fabian Maienfisch explains.

The German federal government last Wednesday issued an export ban for medical protective equipment such as safety glasses, respiratory masks, protective coats, protective suits and gloves. The day before, the French government ordered the confiscation of all protective masks.

Switzerland is hit hard by these measures because the country itself hardly produces any medical consumables. The goods are manufactured in the Far East, especially in China. German companies order large quantities there; Swiss companies buy part of it and transport the material from Germany to Switzerland. This sales channel is broken. The German ban affects both exports to EU and non-EU countries.

""Switzerland immediately presented itself to the responsible ministries in Berlin at a high level,"" said the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs. Furthermore, the Seco invited the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to a discussion on this matter on Friday. ""In these contacts, the German authorities were urged to release the blocked shipments immediately.""

In Switzerland, supplies of protective masks are dwindling. The National Center for Infection Prevention instructed the hospitals on Friday that doctors should no longer wear surgical protective masks for two, but eight hours. ""Having the wet mask in front of your face for a day is uncomfortable,"" says Andreas Widmer, President of the center. But given the dwindling supply of masks, this is the only solution in the short term that will continue to guarantee the protection needed.

Switzerland has a central warehouse of protective masks that will be handed over to the cantons in the coming weeks. However, there is no storage for protective suits. The authorities hope that Germany will soon give in to the dispute over the medical protective material. Otherwise, the already difficult containment of the corona virus could become even more delicate."

This sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned."

The authorities justify this by overloading the hospitals. Comprehensive tests are no longer possible due to the laboratory capacities. Photo: Getty Images Comprehensive tests are no longer possible due to the laboratory capacities. The corona virus is also spreading rapidly in Switzerland. The number of confirmed infections rose to over 200 on Friday. Switzerland is facing an epidemic wave, said Daniel Koch of the Federal Office of Public Health (BAG) on Friday before the media. And you will increasingly lose control over the number of people infected. Because around 80 percent of patients in whom the disease takes a mild course will hardly be tested in the future. Those who have symptoms of flu or a cold, including cough or fever, should no longer report to the hospitals, but should stay at home, said Koch, head of the communicable diseases department at the BAG. Health ministers Alain Berset and Koch appealed to the population not to storm the emergency department at the weekend if there were mild symptoms of illness. ""Because of the increasing number of cases, healthcare facilities are under great pressure,"" said Berset. The goal must now be to keep the hospital capacities free for people with severe illness. According to Koch, there are currently corona patients in the hospitals who have been hospitalized for isolation but do not need hospital care. For reasons of capacity, the hospitals could no longer accept such patients. Laboratories are busy The change in practice relieves the hospitals, but means that Switzerland is increasingly losing control over the spread of the disease. Because patients who stay at home with flu-like symptoms are usually no longer tested for the coronavirus. Comprehensive tests are not possible due to the laboratory capacities. Even those who return from a risk area in Italy and then only show mild symptoms should stay at home without getting tested. However, if corona patients with a mild course are no longer identified as such, relatives are at risk of becoming infected. ""Most of the transmissions are already taking place at home,"" says Koch. However, not everyone who had contact with corona patients was infected. Nevertheless, the risk that relatives of the sick spread the virus when they go to work increases. According to Koch, they should do this as long as they do not show any symptoms of illness. The risk of infection is relatively small in these cases..."""

The more serious the health risk, the more likely the person would be tested, so the number of deaths is likely much more accurate than the number of cases.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond\_Princess\_(ship)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Princess_(ship))

&#x200B;

On the Diamond Princess as of February 18th there were 542 infected, and by March 5th it was up to 696, with 7 deaths so far.  So, in a closed setting, with mostly old people who are at higher risk, where we know for sure that EVERYONE was tested... the death rate was about 1.3% at worst (using February 18th infected numbers).  If no one else dies, the death rate would stand at almost exactly 1%.  Obviously this is a small sample size, with some weird correlations to consider (older people, but also not in very poor health people), but it's a little piece of optimism to consider in the waves and waves of bad news."

I live in the USA. Population is about 300M people.

What follows are some estimates, and calculations from those estimates. I’ll also do my best to be conservative in all my estimates. 

Suppose 5% of the population contracts the virus. That’s 15M people who get the virus, whether asymptomatic or fully symptomatic.

We could jump from there right into the death rate. But maybe that’s brash. Still, assuming 2% kill rate (and not 3.4% that the WHO recently upped it to), that’s 300,000 killed.

Suppose we don’t jump right into that though. Let’s figure maybe 10% of the infected become seriously ill and need to be hospitalized. That’s 1.5M patients. 30K per state, sick at roughly the same time, on top of all the other “regular” sick people.

Is that a lot? I don’t know. That’s based off 5%. If we assume 20% get the virus, use the WHO kill rate of 3.4%, and assume 20% of the infected need hospitalization, that means 60M get infected, of which 12M need hospitalization ( 240K each state), 2.04M killed. 

There’s a lot of other calculations and variables we can add to that, but I’m wondering how concerned we should be about this."

Leaving us extremely vulnerable. They are also predicting we will be out of PPE quite quickly, as we only have 95 mil (I believe) on hand country wide. Also, my state doesn’t have enough beds or equipment t for even a mild flu season, let alone an outbreak. 

Both our cases in my state have broken quarantine. Our one case in the capital city is being traced, however, he has potentially exposed hundreds to the virus through his work and decision to go partying (according to current info circulating). This means in the next few we will more than likely see a mass influx of cases. 

So, while the government is doing alright in some areas, they are failing in many others with this. Such as the Morrison government currently working to remove casual workers’ sick leave."
