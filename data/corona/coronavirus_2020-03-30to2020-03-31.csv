The tl;dr is pretty much:

Japan has very few COVID-19 cases for a country with such lax policy. Undertesting alone can't account for this, or there would be very visisble affects of coronavirus already, as there are in Italy/the US. 



So why is Covid-19 taking less hold? Not because Japan somehow has a more hygienic culture than other countries but specifically because of: 


1. avoiding handshakes, which are far grosser than you think

2. everyone wearing masks - which decreases the stigma of sick people wearing masks

3. the social distancing Japan implemented wasn't extreme, but because it was effective because it was implemented early. 

On trains: Density is less important for the spread of COVID than you'd think because people have to be conversing/vocalising for the disease to transmit effectively. 

On the recent uptick in cases:


1. Early success combined with undertesting meant COVID-19 could still spread, but slowly. Especially among young and asymptomatic people who never ended up at a hospital. 

2. The Japanese governments response was based on some bad data. 

3. Because the spread of cases was hidden by undertesting, people relaxed at the worst possible time and starting ignoring social distancing guidelines. Almost straight after, you see the uptick in cases in Tokyo. 

Basically Japan had some great advantages/early wins against covid-19 but those advantages ended up simply letting the goverment get away with bad policy. A serious COVID-19 outbreak was delayed but not prevented."

>The ratings agency warned that sectors “most sensitive to consumer demand and sentiment” will be especially hard-hit due to social distancing measures that slashed economic activity. They include global passenger airlines, the lodging and cruise industries, and autos. In addition, plummeting energy prices will leave the oil and gas sector exposed, while banks also will face a challenging environment amid falling interest rates that eat into profitability and a deteriorating economy that will undermine credit quality.

>“The coronavirus will cause an unprecedented shock to the global economy,” Edmond DeForest, senior credit officer at Moody’s, said in a report. “We have revised our growth forecasts downward for 2020 as the rising economic costs of the coronavirus shock and the policy responses to combat the downturn are becoming clearer.

I've always argued that the greatest benefit of surgical masks is that it prevents you from directly contacting mucous membranes or secretions.

A virus is the stuff of mystery and fear, an invisibly lurking danger ready to spread explosively around the globe. The new coronavirus, like SARS, MERS and the seasonal flu, enters our bodies, finds its way inside our DNA and commandeers it to make more copies of itself. Viruses are, in many ways, the ultimate parasites.

Yet we, like every other creature on Earth, have a complex relationship with them. Many of the traits that make viruses so effective at transmitting disease also make them an essential part of our genetic makeup. As it turns out, their contributions to our genome over the eons account for a range of important human qualities.

Viruses sit at the edge of our definition of living things. They are tiny bits of genetic material enclosed by a protective shell. Alone, they sit lifeless and inert, waiting for a favorable environment in which to reproduce. Viruses are carried to their unwilling hosts by insects, droplets in the air, contact with infected surfaces and other mechanisms that bring cells of different species together.

When a virus encounters a host cell, a chain reaction of molecular events is set in motion: The virus attaches itself to the outer wall of the cell, enters inside, travels to the cell’s genome, merges with its genes and then tricks the host’s genome into making copies of itself.

The host cell becomes a factory for new viruses and can produce as many as a million of them before it dies. This explosive growth can happen simultaneously in tissues throughout the body. As the virus spreads in one individual’s body, it can escape via water droplets expelled from the air in the lungs, sweat produced by sweat glands or fluids produced by other organs, thereby passing the infection to others.

There are more viruses on Earth than there are stars in the known universe.
This selfish behavior makes viruses, as a Darwinian matter, enormously successful. There is an almost unfathomable number of them in and around us all the time. By some estimates, the number of viruses in the oceans alone is as large as a 10 with 31 zeros behind it. All told, there are more viruses on Earth than there are stars in the known universe.

What’s more, viruses are incredibly diverse and ever evolving. That is why we need a new flu vaccine each year and suffer from emerging diseases like Covid-19 with increasing regularity.

But researchers at the University of Utah came away with a different take on viruses while working in 2016 on a gene that plays a role in the ability to make memories. Mice with a mutation in this gene, known as Arc, can find their way through a maze with cheese in the center but—unlike mice with the normal Arc gene—can’t remember their path through the maze the next day. In humans, changes to Arc have been linked to a range of disorders, from schizophrenia to dementia. Arc is a gene that memories are made of.

To understand the gene, the team in Utah isolated the protein it made and put it under a powerful microscope. The lead researcher, Jason Shepherd, saw that the protein formed spheres that were visible at high magnification. That structure set off alarm bells for him: He was sure he had seen such spheres when he took a course in infectious diseases in his early days in graduate school. The Arc protein had spherules that looked exactly like those made by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Dr. Shepherd gave the slide to viral specialists working in the building next door without telling them what was on it. The virus experts were sure they were looking at spheres made by HIV.

When the team sequenced the gene for Arc, decoding the string of molecules that make it up, they were in for an even bigger surprise. This memory gene was, for all purposes, a modified virus.


A memory gene was, for all purposes, a modified virus.
The virus that causes AIDS makes protein spheres because they protect HIV’s genes as they journey from cell to cell in its host. As it turns out, the same thing happens with the memory gene, Arc, which also works by moving genetic information from cell to cell. The viral strategy of making protein spheres, which is so dangerous in disease, works to our benefit in Arc.

Memory genes aren’t the only ones derived from viruses in our bodies. Genes that make proteins at work in the placenta, so essential for human reproduction, also arose from viruses. When a team from Germany did a computational search of the human genome, they found that as many as 85 genes derived from viruses may be at work in different parts of the brain and during pregnancy.

The past two decades have witnessed a golden age of genome projects. We have mapped the human genome, the corn genome and genomes for many thousands of species of microbes, fungi, animals and plants. With all this information, the more we look, the more we find ancient viruses hiding inside our genomes, as well as those of other creatures.

Almost 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected us but have been rendered inactive. That fact is even more astounding when you consider that genes—the part of DNA that codes for proteins—comprise only 2% of our genome. We have four times more viral genetic material inside our genome than our own genes.

The ability to make spheres to move genetic material from cell to cell, so essential in the spread of infections such as AIDS, became useful to our distant ancestors. Researchers looking at the history of Arc have found that fish don’t have it, but their descendants—amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals—do. The ancient fish that evolved to walk on land about 375 million years ago, it seems, got an infection that would change the course of history and, ultimately, our own abilities.


We live in a state of war between viral invaders and our own genome. One outcome can be that viruses take over and we become ill. The other is that viruses can be the source of new genetic inventions—fuel for evolutionary change.

Viruses are microscopic pieces of genetic material capable of wreaking havoc on our world and disrupting our interactions with one another. Yet new insights into genomes, and four billion years of the history of life, offer another side of the story. Each one of us is part virus, in ways that affect who we are and what we can do.

&#x200B;

>Lübeck - Researchers Linlin Zhang and Rolf Hilgenfeld from the University of Lübeck have made a real breakthrough. They were able to decipher an enzyme that is crucial for the multiplication of the novel coronavirus. The researchers also found an inhalable inhibitor that works against the newly decoded main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  It is specifically about the main viral protease Mpro, without which the coronavirus cannot copy its genetic material (RNA) from the host cell and thus multiply it. Closer research into the enzyme structure could now help combat the virus. An inhibitor that has been developed against related corona viruses has already been tested effectively in mice and in cell cultures.  
>  
>The main protease is the decisive factor in the fight against the virus, since it cannot multiply without it. With the discovery of the two Lübeck researchers Zhang and Hilgenfeld, a new approach for antiviral agents against the novel corona virus is now being opened.  Covid-19's worryingly continuously increasing number of cases \* is putting researchers worldwide under pressure. A suitable vaccine is currently being rushed for - but also for antiviral agents that could prevent the spread of the pathogen in the body and thus also stop it.  Possible successes already seem to be emerging. An inhibitor that had been developed by Hilgenfeld and his team against the MERS-CoV pathogen and other related coronaviruses a few years ago is also said to have been found to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. In the mice, the inhibitor accumulated in the lungs and kidneys as hoped - these organs are most affected in Covid-19.  
>  
>But the experiments also worked with human lung cell cultures. In the case of already infected lung cells, the new inhibitor blocked the multiplication of the virus, thus preventing the infection from progressing. According to the researchers, the inhalable inhibitor of the main protease opens up an approach for new agents against the rampant coronavirus. The researchers also found that the inhibitors were highly likely to be non-toxic. However, the developments are probably too late to counteract the current pandemic. ""It will certainly take several years for our active ingredient to develop into an anti-coronavirus drug,"" says Hilgenfeld."

""I don't think we're going to see major new traits, but I do think that we're going to see different variants emerge in the population,"" says Bahl.

And that slower rate of change is potentially good news for treatments and vaccines. Researchers think that once a person gains immunity against SARS-CoV-2, either by recovering from an infection or by getting a future vaccine, they will likely be protected against the strains in circulation for ""years rather than months,"" predicts Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, in an assessment shared on Twitter.

Is the coronavirus about to wipe out FHA lending?
Investor anxiety already washed away non-QM lending

Over the last week, many (if not all) of the biggest lenders specializing in lending to borrowers outside the Qualified Mortgage lending box paused their activities due to uncertainty in the market.

Here’s how the mortgage industry laid out that problem in a letter sent to federal decision-makers earlier this week: “To give one a sense of scale, if 25% of the nation receives forbearance for only 3 months, servicers will have to cover payments of roughly $36 billion. If they received it for 9 months, then the cost would exceed $100 billion.”

Those economic conditions are making FHA loans undesirable both on the front end and on the secondary market. FHA loans are securitized by Ginnie Mae along with Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Agriculture loans. And those securities and the mortgage servicing rights that go with them are viewed as too risky for all parties involved right now.

No more government backed loans for people with shit credit or shit for down payments. Also, they're preparing for a lot of people not paying for mortgages"

2020-03-30,keepsake4,Coronavirus,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/frwohi/immunity_passports_could_speed_up_return_to_work/fly2tvm/,"The antibody test will divide society in two - the Lockdowners and the Restarters. Armed with a positive antibody test, the Restarters will call for the restart of society. The Lockdowners will want to stay holed up in the lockdown world as long as it takes, waiting for the vaccine.

It will start with healthcare workers, who will get antibody tests en masse, and rightly so. But then, since they are declared 'immune' in the hospital, why not be immune everywhere else?

Watching these developments, the Restarters will call for antibody testing for anyone else who wants it - and they will get it. But they won't wait for the tests. Those who previously had a positive PCR test, and those who had symptoms but no test, will declare themselves immune. They will wear t-shirts with 'immune' in large letters. A recognizable mark or symbol will appear, perhaps a blue [armband](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fraaa9/germany_will_issue_coronavirus_antibody/flv41zs/) with 'immune' written on it.

They will defy lockdown orders, and congregate in public spaces. Some will be arrested and fined. Many will fight the charges - and they will bring lawyers who themselves have a positive antibody test - and they will win.

Governments will push the 'back to work' mantra, and implement some system of certificates to verify those with antibody tests, again starting with healthcare workers, but quickly moving to essential workers, and then anyone who wants one. Lockdowners will decry the system as encouraging deliberate infection.

This [electronic wristband](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/03/20/business/tech/asia-deploys-innovative-invasive-tech-curb-virus/) is already used to track the quarantined in Hong Kong - it could easily be adapted for antibody tests.

Smaller non-essential businesses will re-open, again in defiance of lockdown orders, but staffed only with people with antibody tests. Bars, clubs, restaurants, gyms. They will purportedly only allow entry to those with antibody tests, using the official government system. But policy will be lax, and never-infected restarters will easily slip through the gaps.

Restarter corona-parties will take place. They will have to remain secretive in lockdown areas, since actual parties with music are obvious targets to have the cops called. No masks, no hand-washing, kisses, hugs and hand-shaking all round. Highly-symptomatic infecters will cough into the mouths of the infectees. C'mon, the first wave of infections is over, so now there's plenty of ventilators in the hospitals, right?

Meanwhile, the Lockdowners will dig in, refusing to go outside without PPE. They have the promise of the vaccine, and they have the greater numbers - for now. But they will realise they are losing control of the physical world, the outside world. Distrust of household and family members will set in. Your housemate starts to show symptoms - did they get it on purpose? It's well after the first wave, and considering the reduction in global dimming, it's going to be a long hot summer.

So, here is the question that every never-infected person on Earth must now answer:
	
Are willing to take the 1 in 50 or 1 in 500 chance of death, to go back to 2019?"

>Fearmongering or scaremongering is the spreading of frightening and exaggerated rumors of an impending danger to purposely arouse fear in order to manipulate the public.

The definition implies there are ulterior motives such as personal gain to be made from spreading fear, or that it is based on exaggeration and deception. I don't see any of that from myself, the CBC or this particular doctor.

The people who are meaninglessly repeating that word sound exactly like climate science deniers. The coronavirus is not a made up or exaggerated threat. Anthony Fauci has said it may kill 200,000 people in the US alone.

In my mind, the world has been in a perpetual state of collapse for a while now, and events like this coronavirus pandemic are symptoms of a wider and ongoing event that shall continue, and get worse, going forward. For critics of collapse, this gives them a lot of ammunition with which to counter my argument, for my view is intangible, it contains many variables, and it is hard to justify without dedicating a great deal of time to such a course.

I view the pandemic as a symptom of human inaction, of human destruction, of human tribalism, of human avarice - an event that could have been stopped, delayed, or even after failing with those two aims, eased considerably, was there any kind of political will to put people ahead of the propping up of our phoney economy. The public could have been better-equipped, better-educated and engaged much earlier on the dangers of this virus 2 months ago, when it was already an inevatibility, had there existed a collective will to do so.

It is this same lack of a will that politicians utilise when facing all the major problems that we are heading towards; mass unemployment, homelessness, a zombie economy, and the biggest elephant of them all looming large, albeit (perhaps) slightly farther away, climate change. Climate change, a calamity that shall make coronavirus look mildly challenging in comparison. There will be no new ideas to face these challenges. There will be no unity. There will be only greed, vanity and narcissism, among people who want their share of the pie. Meanwhile, the human race will decay. Then it will die

*”A narrative rocketed around social media earlier today: An Imperial College study said that COVID-19 could kill 500,000 Brits, but in recent testimony, Neil Ferguson, the head of the group behind the study, put the number below 20,000. Clearly the lying alarmist was walking back his ridiculous predictions!*


*”Well, no. The paper actually offered simulations of numerous scenarios. The one resulting in 500,000 deaths was one where Great Britain just carried on life as before. Other scenarios, where the country locked down whenever it was necessary to stop the disease’s spread, put death totals below 20,000. (See the rightmost death columns of [Tables 4 and 5.)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf)”*

Today we had an increase of 351 positive cases today in Ontario, or at least this is what I would've said if Ontario didn't change their table. Today, I don't know how many positive cases we had because that information no longer exists anymore. Some people might've assumed that the first row of ""number of cases"" means the number of positive cases, however that isn't the case. 

The number of cases includes also the resolved and deceased cases. ""Oh so then /u/Scyllarious, just subtract the 431 resolved cases and 23 deceased cases from the number of cases and we'll get the positive cases"". Great idea Tim, this is exactly what I did until the I saw that the result was 1706-431-23=1252. 1,252 positive cases is what the answer is suppose to be, but we all know this is false. There's no way we're actually decreasing in cases, not now at least. 

So what is causing this discrepancy? Its the resolved cases. While some people might think the large uptick in resolved cases means that Ontario is simply doing the backlog of the recovered patients, that's not actually the case. This is how nefarious this shit has become. Originally resolved meant that a patient has been tested negative twice with a 24 hr in between. Now that definition also includes cases that are not currently listed as hospitalized. So what this means is that you could be positive with COVID-19 but if you're not hospitalized, you're considered resolved. 

What this does is it completely screws up the data, you can see this from the total tested cases. On the website, it shows that we tested a total of 48,461 cases. But yesterday, we tested 49,186. That's a difference of 725 cases, and that's still not it. I haven't even taken into account today's daily tests yet. We tested around 6.4k cases today, add in the 725 missing cases and now we're up to 7k cases unaccounted for!

I am thoroughly disappointed in the change, it just feels like another way to hide and obscure the numbers.

“HCP use of homemade masks:
In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.”"

You are right. It’s a combination of Biden getting a lot worse and Trump getting a little better

Biden’s plan to show up Trump with well planned written out daily coronavirus update speeches could not be going worse.  

It was a great idea. 

**Trump is in a situation that highlights his great weaknesses**

Trump is shitty at grasping the hundreds of details of a complex fluid situation. He is inclined to bullshit due to refusal to dig into the nitty gritty. Trump is compelled to constant exaggeration, overpromising ensures he will always under deliver. Worse of all Trump is usually unable to ignore criticism and rise above personal attacks and act like the leader of the whole nation and the world.

**A perfect storm to ruin him politically**


Joe was going to stage updates to show what a real President looks like. (like Governor Cuomo does in real life)

**But Biden has already had so many flubs and dubs it is actually sad to watch them played back to back**

I remember prime Joe Biden in Senate Judiciary hearings in the 80’s and 90’s. He was as quick, engaged, fluid and in the moment as Trey Gowdy is today in the hearings.

Biden was always  in control and by force of intellect alone could grab a room and a TV camera with his overwhelming complete mastery of the facts, the situation and the point he was striving to make. 

He was never a the top shelf podium speaker in the same way of Reagan, Clinton or Obama, but in a fluid situation without a prepared speech he was masterful.

That man is gone. He may visit from time to time when Joe if feeling great, well prepared and rested, but he doesn’t live there full time anymore.

**In the meantime Trump grows a little more Presidential everyday. Trump will never match Cuomo’s command of the situation but his understanding of the logistics, challenges and danger is growing daily**

He is only wandering off script and repeating himself a half a dozen times a day. (The public sees that as Trump being Trump, not a Trump with an impaired brain)

The Biden team needs to get him off the TV right away. 

Run commercials 24/7 with him in control. run short pre recorded blips of what he would do if he was President. He is not is good mental shape. The VP pick will be very important, it definitely should be Cuomo, the feminist will get over it and vote Democrat anyway. It should be implied constantly by those around Biden that he and Cuomo will be working hand in hand and Joe will resign “if” he feels impaired."

""Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday morning that those living in Southeast Florida should stay home until mid-May to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. He would sign an executive order, he said, urging those in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe Counties to stay home.

The news spread quickly, as thousands of South Floridians reading online and watching on television mentally prepared to stay indoors — and away from work — for another month and a half. The Republican Party of Florida even issued a statement from Sarasota Sen. Joe Gruters, who doubles as the party chair, noting the mid-May date.

“Gov. DeSantis is resolutely leading the state through the coronavirus outbreak with measured, informed, effective actions to protect the health and rights of Floridians,” he wrote.

In between his 10 a.m. stop at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens and his 1:30 p.m. appearance in Palm Beach County, his schedule showed an 11:30 a.m. conference call with other governors and Vice President Mike Pence.

Then, three-and-a-half hours later at the press conference in Palm Beach County,DeSantis clarified that he meant April 15, not mid-May, for an end date to what he called the “safer at home” order for millions of residents."""

The pandemic has forced them to postpone it until later. It doesn’t seem rude or selfish to me. I see it as them simply wanting to fulfill their wedding plans. 

The fact that they’re going to be legally married before their reception/celebration actually comes to fruition is just part of the many impacts of the coronavirus. 

There are a lot of societal sacrifices and compromises because of this pandemic. So things are a little weird for now. They want to become legally married as planned and somehow still have the celebration. One can be done soon. And the other has to wait. 

None of them wanted it to be like this. They’re trying to fulfill their bridal dreams...in the only way they can at this point.


Edited to add:
They probably aren’t viewing their wedding as a method of gaining money and gifts from their loved ones. They probably view it as a memorable, fun day of celebration. This likely isn’t a strategy they’ve dreamt up in the name of exploiting their guests. They’re imagining the food and the dancing and the ambiance of the evening...and they don’t want to lose it. So they’re postponing it. 

That being said, weddings ARE expensive for the guests. If it’s a problem for you, it’s okay to decline the invitation or give according to your capability. 

If this was a random couple who had gotten married a few years ago and suddenly decided they wanted a “wedding,” then it would feel weird to spend all the money on them that guests usually spend. But this is not that. It is a wild circumstance thrust upon them through no choose of their own. Their wedding plans have been cancelled because of a virus. It’s super bizarre.

You spread that 200k over the span of a year. That’s not how this death toll is distributed. At the peak we could see over 2,000 deaths per day. And again, that’s if we’re doing everything right. States like Florida that don’t have stay at home orders are increasing this number daily, and we are continuing to drive that number up with every passing day. https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections

It’s impossible to know who those 200k people actually are. 19 year olds with no preexisting conditions are dying. Obesity and asthma are listed as critical health concerns. Almost 40% of the US is obese or overweight, and almost 10% have asthma.

[As the novel coronavirus spreads throughout Washington, can you boost your immunity with food?](https://www.seattletimes.com/life/wellness/as-the-novel-coronavirus-spreads-throughout-washington-can-you-boost-your-immunity-with-food/)

>One of vitamin D’s many roles in the body is supporting the immune system, and vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of infections. A 2017 review from the World Health Organization found that although much more research is needed, it appears that taking a daily vitamin D supplement may decrease the risk of respiratory tract infections.

The studies she must be referring to are at: [https://www.who.int/elena/titles/vitamind\_pneumonia\_children/en/](https://www.who.int/elena/titles/vitamind_pneumonia_children/en/)

which contains a link to this meta-analysis: [https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583.long](https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583.long)

>**Results** 25 eligible randomised controlled trials (total  11 321 participants, aged 0 to 95 years) were identified. IPD were  obtained for 10 933 (96.6%) participants. Vitamin D supplementation  reduced the risk of acute respiratory tract infection among all  participants

&#x200B;

>**Conclusions** Vitamin D supplementation was safe and it  protected against acute respiratory tract infection overall. Patients  who were very vitamin D deficient and those not receiving bolus doses  experienced the most benefit.

I've had a few health issues the last years: IBS, acid reflux, chronic insomnia and have been taking vitamin D3 supplements the last years as my blood tests did show mine was at the lower end of the range. Had another blood test earlier this year but my vitamin D was still at the low end of the range.

Edit: It is super important to note that the wearing of masks does in no way, shape or form, reduce the need to continue following guidances on avoiding becoming infected: self-isolation, social distancing, proper hand washing, etc."

>Stickers with new expiry dates are being put on PPE that expired in 2016. Doctors have been forced to go to hardware stores to buy their own face masks. Patients with suspected COVID-19 are mixing with non-COVID-19 patients. The situation is so dire that staff are frequently breaking down in tears. As one physician wrote, “The utter failure of sound clinical leadership will lead to an absolute explosion of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.” Front-line staff are already contracting and dying from the disease.

Bottom line:

>February should have been used to expand coronavirus testing capacity, ensure the distribution of WHO-approved PPE, and establish training programmes and guidelines to protect NHS staff. They didn't take any of those actions. The result has been chaos and panic across the NHS. Patients will die unnecessarily. NHS staff will die unnecessarily. It is, indeed, as one health worker wrote last week, “a national scandal”. The gravity of that scandal has yet to be understood."

Carole Baskin is an animal rights activist and owner of Big Cat Rescue, a non-profit animal sanctuary based near Tampa, Florida.[1] Baskin drew public attention for her role in a 2020 Netflix true crime documentary limited series, Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness, a series about the life-to-date of private zoo operator Joseph Maldonado-Passage. The Netflix series follows both Baskin and Maldonado-Passage, filming their ongoing and escalating feuds over exotic animals in private zoos.

Baskin is the chief executive officer of Big Cat Rescue, an animal sanctuary near Tampa, Florida for big cats that her deceased former husband founded in 1992.[2][3][4] Her animal sanctuary does not place animals back into the wild, but keeps the animals for the duration of their life.[5] [6]

In March 2020 Big Cat Rescue temporarily closed to the public due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States.[5][7]

Joe Exotic feud
Joseph Maldonado-Passage ran a private zoo that housed hundreds of big cats, leading to him being nicknamed ""The Tiger King"". As a proponent of cub petting and a breeder of tigers, Big Cat Rescue and Maldonado-Passage became involved in intense publicity and legal battles. Maldonado-Passage accused Baskin of hypocrisy, as she herself had formerly bred and sold exotic cats for private ownership. During this time, he also made many comments about wanting to kill Carole Baskin on his web series.

In 2019 Joseph Maldonado-Passage was charged with planning murder-for-hire of Baskin.[8][5] Baskin had been highly critical of Maldonado-Passage and his park, Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park.[9] The alleged murder plot came after Baskin won a multi-million dollar court case against Maldonado-Passage's park.[3]

Murder accusations
Baskin had been married to millionaire Don Lewis, who disappeared in August 1997. Two months prior to his disappearance, Lewis had filed for a restraining order against Baskin, saying Baskin had a firearm and threatened to kill him, but it was rejected.[10] She had him declared legally dead in 2002.[3][11] Lewis's children believed his disappearance was suspicious and a dispute ensued over the estate, which was mostly left to Baskin.[10]

In media
She was featured in the 2020 crime documentary series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.[12] She later spoke out against the series, calling it ""salacious and sensational"", and criticized directors Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin.[9] She stated that the filmmakers lied about the nature of the series. According to Baskin, when they approached her about the series they told her they were going to be making ""the big cat version of Blackfish.""[9][13]

It was announced in March 2020 that Kate McKinnon would portray Baskin in an upcoming scripted series.[14]"

His name is Jake and he’s the star player on both the basketball and football teams. Every prom king for the past decade has been a jock and I think Jake just ran because everyone assumed he would. Unlike Jake, I actually care about getting elected prom king because I want to be an inspiration to the majority of the school who aren’t popular like Jake and his friends, and I thought that maybe I could appeal to this majority to keep Jake from taking the crown.

Now, I’m not a complete outcast, but I’m not athletic and don’t really hang out with people outside my small group of friends. However, I am friendly with almost the entire senior class so I knew early on that I could win the election if I worked hard enough. I started my campaign when I realized that Jake would be running unopposed by having my friends and I persuade potential voters in the school hallway. It was going to be difficult to beat Jake using traditional campaigning methods so we thought of ways to increase my vote share relative to Jake’s. For example, we tried to split the vote between Jake and another athlete, but Jake was too well-liked and no athlete wanted to run against him. The strategy we settled on was increasing prom turnout among students less likely to attend prom because that’s the demographic most likely to vote for me.

During our hallway campaigning, I realized that there is a strong anti-jock sentiment among the senior class, but it’s especially strong among unreliable prom attendees. If I could persuade a fraction of them to show up to prom then their friends would likely come with them. For example, I know for a fact that my friend Rob and his girlfriend are going to prom. His girlfriend is bringing her friends who might bring more people who wouldn’t otherwise show up. In fact, all my friends are unreliable prom attendees. I had already increased turnout by a substantial margin without even trying. Beating Jake was going to be easier than I thought, as long as I could get past initial voting.

On a Monday two months before prom, every member of the senior class gets handed an initial voting ballot by their first period teacher. They are instructed to write down one name for prom king and one name for prom queen. Every senior that gets 50 or more votes is put on the final ballot, and only prom attendees vote for prom king and queen from the final ballot. Getting past initial voting would be easy because everyone is allowed to vote. I thought that winning from the final ballot would be much harder, but when I realized how many of my friends were going to prom the dream started to seem more like a reality.

On the Friday before the Monday of initial voting, I was confident that I was going to pass the 50 vote threshold by a large margin. I felt like my work was starting to pay off, but my excitement didn’t last long. When I got home from school, I opened up my computer and saw that Jake posted a facebook status update:

""Dear prom king voters. After much consideration, I have decided to drop out of the prom king race. To all of the students who were planning on voting for me, I would like you to vote for Austin [last name]. Austin is one of the nicest and most caring members of the class of 2020. Everytime I see him in the hallway, he has a smile on his face, and that always puts a smile on my face. There is no one in the senior class with as much school spirit as Austin, and I don't think any of us can imagine [high school name] without him. I cannot think of a better choice for prom king than Austin [last name].""

Austin has autism. All this time, I thought that Jake was my real opponent. I never even considered the possibility that he wasn’t. My entire strategy was centered on beating Jake by positioning myself as the anti-jock, but now I was the jock. The higher prom turnout would hurt me now. Austin didn’t even campaign and within five minutes he was the frontrunner.

All the work I put into this campaign was erased with a single facebook post. All the work my friends put in. It was all for an unwinnable election. Losing the election fairly would’ve felt better than what I felt reading Jake’s post. I was angry. Angry at myself. Angry at Jake. I know he had good intentions, but why didn’t he tell me he was dropping out before he sabotaged my campaign? I was about ready to give up.

But then I had an idea.

On Sunday, I posted this on facebook:

""Thank you to everybody who plans on nominating me for prom king. However, I am telling everyone who was planning on voting for me to vote for Billy [last name]. I've known Billy since kindergarten and there is no one who cares as much about the school as Billy. I’m not going to list every reason why Billy should be picked to represent our class, because you all already know that he is a representation of everything that our school strives to be. All I will say is that I am proud to call Billy a friend. So for those of you planning on voting for me tomorrow, thank you, but I will be casting my vote for Billy [last name] and I think that you should too.""

Billy has down syndrome. The perfect spoiler for Austin.

Because Jake posted his facebook status on Friday, all of his voters saw it or talked to someone over the weekend who saw it. I posted my facebook status on Sunday so only some of my voters saw it. I even unfriended some of my likely voters to make sure I stayed above the 50 vote threshold. It worked, because on Friday the school revealed the three seniors who made it onto the final ballot: Austin, Billy, and Me. For the first time, I was the frontrunner.

This was one month ago. Prom is scheduled for a month from now, but the school will either delay it or cancel it because of the coronavirus. I understand and respect whatever decision my school makes because I understand the real threat of coronavirus, but that doesn’t mean I have to be happy about it. I am praying every night that my school doesn’t cancel prom.

Prom is supposed to be a milestone in our lives and a giant step into adulthood, but every prom just ends being a way for the popular kids to pretend they’re royalty. For the majority of students, prom is just a dance that they go to because they feel like they have to, if they even go at all. But this prom was supposed to change that. This prom was supposed to topple the social hierarchy. This was going to be our year. And if prom is cancelled, then so are the dreams of every social outcast, everyone who doesn't fit in with the popular crowd, everyone who feels like they don’t have a voice. Everyone who was looking up to me to be their king."

>There are some worries over health care in Italy today — and they owe precisely to the fact that the system has been chipped away over the last twenty-five years — indeed, “Americanized.” In the early 1990s, off the back of Clintonism and the “Third Way,” various legislative measures introduced quasi-market elements into our public health service, greatly weakening its effectiveness while also regionalizing control over it. This had the effect that only the richest regions (although, fortunately enough now, the ones where this epidemic has hit hardest first) could keep guaranteeing the same standards we had all become used to.
>
>This legacy of privatization is weakening our response to coronavirus today. According to the World Health Organization, between 1997 and 2015, the number of intensive care beds in Italy more than halved, from 575 per 100,000 people to 275. Faced with such cuts, the private sector has contributed very little — given the difficulties making money off these particular services. From 2009 to 2017, austerity measures taken as a supposed response to the economic crisis meant that Italy lost 8,000 doctors and 13,000 nurses.

 First it was the Coronavirus, then it was a Coronavirus but we don't know which one, then it was SARS-CoV something, now it's Covid-19. It's a new virus so the official name has been developing as rapidly as the situation, but overall we can see that the generally accepted terms don't refer to China at all. They're referring to the virus, the family of viruses it is in, and the year it first jumped to humans. The name actually describes the particular virus, which it should, because, uh... that's what a name is supposed to do. These are fine names. 

 But Cotton is one of those who's backpedaling and using a name that isn't descriptive or specific, and it's not hard to see why. 

Calling it the China virus makes people hear you and think ""Yeah, this is China's fault."" There's a lot to be said about the Chinese government's response to it, and their constant human rights abuses outside of this issue, but we know this wasn't a deliberate ploy by the CN government (even if it is a result of them refusing to close wet markets). Those things just make them easy to blame them for this too. It detracts from the fact that how hard the virus hits us is going to be dependent in large part in how US legislators like Cotton react to it, which is great because if they perform poorly, their supporters will just blame it on China. Using that name just reinforces that idea. 

And again, because he's using a weird term that no one else is using, and many organizations have warned against, we can tell that he's deliberately signalling something to his supporters and constituents by using this term. Personally, I think that's the most concerning part of this.

ETA: Signalling is also pretty shitty in this scenario because, as others have said, it's very easy to speculate that part of the reason why China is such an easy target is because of xenophobia or racism. The thing about these implicit terms is that you can read whatever you want into it. Best case scenario, it's political finger pointing, worst case scenario, well..."

West Virginia is also a state that is very vulnerable to a public health crisis and economic recession and their Republican-held government hasn't been any rush to take the necessary measures to mitigate the coronavirus.

But this is a novel disease, which we have no vaccine or immunity to, which means that the potential number of infections is much, much higher. Plus, the fatality rate is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher per infection than influenza.

Some doctors guestimate that around 50% of the population may get the coronavirus without serious mitigation efforts ([some sources say as much as 70%](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-150-million-americans-may-get-infected-2020-3)). If 50% end up getting it, and only 1% die, that's still **~1.6 *million* Americans dead**.

Many of our plans are well grounded in years of thoughtful ethical work and real-world experiences, like the Sept. 11 and Boston Marathon attacks, previous flu epidemics, as well as disaster preparedness drills. Recent lessons from China and Italy suggest that the public needs to be fully aware, as hard as this may be to hear, that typical medical options may soon not be available to everyone.

> We have been coordinating with public health officials to support steps to minimize the spread of the coronavirus, while also working diligently and with great urgency to optimize use of the resources we have, and to secure even more. This has included canceling elective surgeries, transitioning to telehealth visits whenever possible, keeping care providers safe by limiting in-person meetings, and restricting visitors in order to protect our most vulnerable patients.

> Should efforts to maximize our current medical resources fall short, we are making preparations for what may become an overwhelming demand for health care services in the coming days, especially critical care. While we will strive daily to identify strategies that are proportional to the challenges we face, we may be forced to transition to “Crisis Standards of Care.” In accordance with these standards, developed over many years of national and global planning for possible pandemic crises, health care systems must shift their focus from optimizing care for each individual patient to a population-wide approach.

Such situations might include, being unable to offer, or continue, ICU treatment and/or ventilator support for patients who, based on the most objective and evidence-based criteria available, have a prognosis too poor to justify using those limited resources in ways that deprive care to other patients for whom there is greater likelihood of benefit.

None of us want to be in the position of choosing who will live and who will die because our capacity to treat is overwhelmed by the number of people in need of treatment. It’s why we beseech the public to do everything possible to help avoid such an outcome: Stay at home.

> Nearly every country is now combating the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1°C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation on COVID-19 transmission from other potentially correlated factors, such as differences in public health responses across countries and heterogeneous population densities. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries. However, these patterns reverse as the boreal winter approaches, with seasonal temperatures in January 2021 increasing average COVID-19 transmission by 59% relative to March 2020 in northern countries and lowering transmission by 2% in southern countries. These findings suggest that Southern Hemisphere countries should expect greater transmission in the coming months. Moreover, Northern Hemisphere countries face a crucial window of opportunity: if contagion-containing policy interventions can dramatically reduce COVID-19 cases with the aid of the approaching warmer months, it may be possible to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 next winter.

**Blissful Ignorance? Submariners Likely Unaware of Pandemic**


LE PECQ, France — Of a world in coronavirus turmoil, they may know little or nothing.
Submariners stealthily cruising the ocean deeps, purposefully shielded from worldly worries to encourage undivided focus on their top-secret missions of nuclear deterrence, may be among the last pockets of people anywhere who are still blissfully unaware of how the pandemic is turning life upside down. 


Mariners aboard ballistic submarines are habitually spared bad news while underwater to avoid undermining their morale, say current and former officers who served aboard France's nuclear-armed subs. 


So any crews that left port before the virus spread around the globe are likely being kept in the dark about the extent of the rapidly unfurling crisis by their commanders until their return, they say. 

> ""They won’t know,” 

said retired Adm. Dominique Salles, who commanded the French ballistic submarine squadron from 2003-2006. 

> “The boys need to be completely available for their mission.”

Speaking exclusively to The Associated Press, Salles said he believes submariners will likely only be told of the pandemic as they head back to port, in the final two days of their mission.

> “Those who are at sea don’t need this information,"" said Salles, who also commanded the nuclear-armed French submarine “L'Inflexible.""

> “The commander, I think, is doubtless informed about what is happening. I don't think he'll have all the details,"" he said. 

The French navy won't divulge what has or hasn't been said to submarine crews. Nor will it say whether any of the four French ballistic submarines, laden with 16 missiles that each can carry six nuclear warheads, left harbor before France instituted a nationwide lockdown on March 17. 

> “Because the deterrent is wrapped in a bubble of protection and confidentiality, it is impossible to know whether the crews are informed or not of this situation,” French navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Olivier Ribard said.

French submarine missions last 60 to 70 days, with about 110 crew members aboard. So a crew that left at the end of February wouldn't be expected back before the end of April. 

In that case, they will return to a world changed by the pandemic. On March 1, France had just 130 confirmed COVID-19 cases and two deaths. In under a month, those numbers have surged past 2,600 dead and over 40,000 sickened.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. 

For submariners, the return to land could be a shock. 

> “They won’t have experienced the crisis as we did, with a bit of fear, the lockdown. So for them it will be quite a surprise. They will learn the history, but it will be a history that is related to them,"" 

said a serving officer who was the doctor on the ballistic submarine “Le Triomphant"" for four years. 

He spoke to the AP on condition that he be identified only by his first name and rank, in accordance with the rules of his branch of the French military. 

> “All events that could affect or change the morale of the crew members are kept from them,"" said the officer, Chief Doctor Gabriel.

> “Since there is no internet, no radio and no television on board, the only news you get comes from messages received by the commander, and the commander filters the messages to not give all of the information to everyone.” 

The doctor was underwater in 2012 when an Islamic extremist killed three French paratroopers and later killed a rabbi, his two young sons and grabbed an 8-year-old girl and shot her in the head. 

Only later did the officer learn of the attacks, “so when people talk to me about it, I find it impossible to imagine,” he said.

> “The only place where you are really cut off from all information is underwater, because even on a vessel in space there is still the radio, television, the internet,"" he said.

When bombings hit Madrid in 2004, Salles didn't inform submariners who were at sea for the ballistic flotilla that was then under his command. 


Salles said the situation now will be toughest for any crews that leave harbor in the weeks ahead, because they'll know they are leaving loved ones in the midst of the pandemic and, possibly, still living in lockdown. 

The French government has already extended its stay-home orders once, to April 15, and said it could do so again. 

Salles said he believes those crews will get regular coronavirus updates, but won't be told of any family deaths until they are returning to the l’Ile Longue submarine base near Brest in Brittany. 

Salles was at sea in a sub when his father died. The news was kept from him until he had finished his 60-day mission. 

> “No matter how serious an event is, there is nothing a submariner can do about it. And since he cannot do anything, better that he know nothing,"" Salles said. 

> “They know that they won't know and accept it. It's part of our deal.”"

America is in crisis, but the celebrities are thriving. They are beaming into our homes, reminding us to stay indoors and “stay positive,” as “we’re all in this together.” When I watch their selfie public service announcements, I find my attention drifting to the edges of the frame: to the understated wall molding visible behind Robert DeNiro’s shoulder; to the Craftsman beams on Priyanka Chopra’s balcony; to the equine wallpaper framing Zoe Kravitz’s crackling fireplace.

“Staying home is my superpower,” “Wonder Woman” star Gal Gadot reported from her walk-in closet. Ryan Reynolds urged his fans to “work together to flatten the curve” from within his rustic loft. When Jennifer Lopez posted a video of her family sheltering in the backyard of Alex Rodriguez’s vast Miami compound, the public snapped.

“We all hate you,” was one representative response.

Among the social impacts of the coronavirus is its swift dismantling of the cult of celebrity. The famous are ambassadors of the meritocracy; they represent the American pursuit of wealth through talent, charm and hard work. But the dream of class mobility dissipates when society locks down, the economy stalls, the death count mounts and everyone’s future is frozen inside their own crowded apartment or palatial mansion. The difference between the two has never been more obvious. The #guillotine2020 hashtag is jumping. As grocery aisles turn bare, some have suggested that perhaps they ought to eat the rich.

So when Pharrell Williams asked his followers to donate to aid frontline responders, they virtually grabbed him by the pants and shook him upside-down, telling him to empty his own deep pockets. Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard have been “outed” as landlords. As Ellen DeGeneres lounged on her sofa, video-chatting with famous friends, the comedian Kevin T. Porter solicited stories from service workers and Hollywood peons who had experienced run-ins with DeGeneres, whom he called “notoriously one of the meanest people alive.”

The film “Parasite,” in which a poor South Korean family cleverly cons its way into the home of a rich one, has been converted into a well-worn social-media retort whenever celebrities offer glimpses inside their own manses; the reference succeeds partly because so many superrich people have such blandly similar minimalist homes.

It must be a very hard time to be so famous. Celebrities are not among the very wealthiest Americans — Lopez’s reported net worth is a fraction of a percent of Jeff Bezos’s — but they are the ones who are tasked with liaising with the general public, offering vicarious access to their lifestyles. Celebrity culture glorifies them not just for their performances or personas but for their wealth itself — their blowout child birthday parties, car collections, plastic surgeries and property ownership. From “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous” to “My Super Sweet Sixteen” and “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” the ability to watch (or hate-watch) this spectacle of excess has functioned as a bizarre appeasement for inequality.

But this compact rests on the celebrity’s ability to seem to move easily between the elite and the masses, to be aspirational and approachable at once. And under normal circumstances, they are accustomed to receiving accolades for “using their platforms” to “raise awareness” in the service of bland initiatives for the public good.

But our awareness has never been so easy to rouse, and misuse. Celebrities have a captive audience of traumatized people who are glued to the internet, eyes darting toward trending topics for clues to processing the unimaginable horrors looming just outside, and instead are finding Madonna bathing in a rose petal-strewn bath.
Stunts like Gal Gadot’s crowdsourced famous-person cover of John Lennon’s “Imagine” are tone-deaf in more ways than one. Most of these people cannot even sing; their contributions suggest that the very appearance of a celebrity is a salve, as if a pandemic could be overcome by star power alone.

One of the ironies of this moment is that though we feel less like stars than ever, they seem to feel more like us — or at least, what they think it must feel like to be us. DeGeneres is going “stir-crazy” from having to stay inside her enormous home; Katy Perry has lost track of the days she’s spent inside her enormous home.

Madonna has elevated celebrity delusion to a kind of performance art. In a series of oddly professional Instagram videos suggesting a perhaps dangerous concentration of staff members in her home, she can be seen undergoing a bizarre healing procedure at her personal health clinic and bending over a typewriter in a kimono, pontificating about the social effects of the virus.

For Madonna, performing for the public and holding fans in her thrall is yet “another luxury gone, for now,” she says in one video. In its place is the disturbing sensation of normalcy. “The audience in my house is not amused by me,” she says. Later, from the bath, she concludes that Covid-19 is “the great equalizer.”

And yet the antics of these celebrities, even as they are publicly shamed, still tug on our attention. I have never thought about Gal Gadot so much in my life. The coronavirus is the odd crisis where doing nothing actually does help — staying inside can save lives. And in addition to food and rent money and medical attention, people require sufficient entertainment to weather the lockdown.

But if I’m going to pay attention to celebrities at a time like this, their contribution better be charming or deranged enough to distract me from the specter of mass suffering and death. Even as the power of pure celebrity tanks, the value of a true entertainer rises. Give me Patti LuPone on the jukebox and Yo-Yo Ma on the cello. Give me Anthony Hopkins playing the piano for his purring cat. Give me January Jones boiling up a “human stew” in her bathtub and Wendy Williams showing off the 5-foot Betty Boop statue that she spray-painted to appear black. Give me the hand-drawn hearts on Stevie Nicks’s note reporting that she is ensconced with her assistant and dogs, self-soothing with the music of Harry Styles.

Give me Britney Spears, who has emerged from this crisis as the rare celebrity to tap into the need for radical social change. Spears recently posted a bright yellow manifesto on Instagram from the internet artist Mimi Zhu. “We will feed each other, re-destribute wealth, strike,” it reads. “Communion moves beyond walls.” Spears added three red roses to the caption, an ambiguous symbol reflecting either her support for the Democratic Socialists of America or perhaps her simple affinity for floral emoji.

Spears is an unexpected figure to lead us through quarantine, but a fitting one: She has been held under a conservatorship for 12 years, her movements and finances controlled by her father and overseen by the courts. When she posts about finding community in social captivity, she knows what she’s talking about."

March 27: Mike Pence. I mean, Mike Pence, I don’t think he sleeps anymore. These are people that should be appreciated. He calls all the governors. I tell him — I mean, I’m a different type of person — I say, 'Mike, don’t call the governor of Washington. You are wasting your time with him. Don’t call the woman in Michigan.' It doesn’t make any difference what happens.

March 27: I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor, Gretchen “Half” Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesn’t have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA (from a tweet)

###Episode Description:  
Former Vice President Joe Biden is joined by Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, for a discussion on President Trump’s handling of COVID-19, what we should be doing differently, and how we move forward.

#Full Transcript of Episode #1 Below

JOE BIDEN: (00:04):

Hey, team Biden is Joe and I’m sitting here in Wilmington, Delaware. It’s a scary time. A lot of people out there confused things are changing every day, every hour. So I wanted to have this conversation with you now if we could, why am I doing this? Well, first so we can keep talking with each other or we can’t hold rallies anymore, but we’re not gathering in large public spaces. We’re living in a new normal. But I want you to know that I’m with you. I’m on your side. [inaudible] get through us together as a country. And a, the second reason is I think this podcast could offer some really helpful information. I’ve seen these kinds of crises before and uh, and I’ve sat in the situation room in the oval office and we’ve grappled three crises from Daniel outbreak to the Iran nuclear deal to the auto industry rescue.

(00:50):

And, uh, during that time I’ve been able to work with some pretty accomplished experts, women and men who have steered us through epidemics and demic. So some of the most complex problems that this country and could possibly face. People who will provide some advice and, and logic and information on the Corona virus crisis that we’re facing. So each week when I’m going to try to do is, uh, be joined by one of those experts, someone who can come offer us some helpful information. Then the two of us will answer questions from you and our first episode, right,

(01:25):

be joined by Ron Klain. Ron is an outside advisor to my campaign, the Ebola response in president Obama’s and my administration in 2014. And so he’s going to talk to us about a few things first about how president Trump downplays this crisis, uh, how he has rattled public confidence and delayed our country’s response. Next, we’ll talk a bit about my plan with the federal government, what they should be doing now. When I say now, I mean immediately to combat this crisis and finally take on some questions from our listeners. So with that, I’d like to welcome Ron, who’s an old friend, uh, to the show. Ron, how are you pal? Good, thank you sir. It’s a pleasure to be with you on your very first pod. Was good to be doing my very first podcast. Things are changing an awful lot and uh, Ron, um, I’m gonna, uh, with your permission, ask a few questions if that’s okay. Sure. Sounds great. Let’s do it. Ron, I think it’d be helpful if you could walk our listeners through the question on top of everyone’s mind. Is there a shortage of testing and why does that exist if there is?

RON KLAIN: (02:30):

Well, this is one of the biggest problems we’ve seen with the coronavirus response. As you’ve said, mr vice-president, the coronavirus isn’t Donald Trump’s fault, but how we responded to it is, and there’s no issue that illustrates that more than this testing fiasco, uh, Donald Trump didn’t take the steps needed to get the testing in place. As a result compared to almost every other developed nation. We’re behind on getting people tested. We’ve probably done about one 25th of the test per capita that South Korea has done. And we both countries had their first case of the exact same day. There’s no reason why this country should be so far behind nations like South Korea in testing, it’s [inaudible], but we have the same technology, we have the same experts, we have even better doctors and healthcare facilities. And yet we’re really far behind. That problem falls squarely on the shoulders of president Trump and his administration.

JOE BIDEN:

I, uh, I’m determined that this should not be political. This is not about partisan politics. It’s about how rapidly we can put in motion the initiatives that are going to save people’s lives and get us through this process. And, uh, I thank you for clarifying the world health organization had the formula we could have used immediately instead of waiting and developing our own way of proceeding. Let me ask another question if I may. A lot of our listeners are interested in how we as a country have handled past health crises. You know, when the Ebola crisis hit, you were, um, my, and president Obama’s first picked to handle it. Take us through that moment. And what you did, you personally, when we asked you to do it, the president asks you to do it. What did you do on day one?

RON KLAIN:(06:03):

Well, you know mr. I suppose you were. You were there, you remember it very well. What you and the president told me on day one was to put science first. I’m not a scientist, I’m not a doctor. Then the problem we had at the time was that you had great advice from science and doctors were trying, having trouble kind of getting an implemented trouble, getting the treatments into West Africa, trouble getting our hospitals ready, all these logistical challenges. And so the direction I got from president Obama, from you, vice president Biden was let’s take the best advice from scientists and doctors and turn that advice into action. And I think by contrast, what we’ve seen here with the Trump response to coronavirus is a failure of both things. The president notoriously is rejecting the advice of scientists and doctors. He’s not listening to people who are telling them he didn’t in January and February when these experts were telling them, we have a big problem who is going out and downplaying the problem.

Speaker 4 (06:59):

He was saying as late as late February, we only have 15 cases. We’ll be down to five and a little little while. He just wasn’t listening to these great experts we have in the government nonpartisan experts. Dr Fowchee served all the way back to Ronald Reagan and is still working on this. And dr [inaudible], dr [inaudible], people I worked with on the Ebola response, they’ve been there for decades. He just kind of pushed all these people aside. What was whatever he went, his own politics. So gut, that’s very, very different from what you and president Obama ordered during the Ebola response. And I know it’s also very, very different from the way you’ve been thinking mr vice president about the response to coronavirus. And I guess I’d like to turn the tables here a little bit and ask you to take a few minutes to talk about your plans for dealing with coronavirus, which I know was so heavily M uh, influenced by the leading science is the leading medical experts you consulted. Can you just talk to the people listening to us about your plan and what the key elements of your plan are?

JOE BIDEN (07:56):

Well, first of all, uh, I should let people know that with your help, I put together a panel of experts, including former heads of the CDC and other organizations and, uh, who are not actively administration now. And, uh, I do, uh, with your help and coordination and others, a daily brief and they give me a detailed outline ahead of time with charts showing the trend lines, uh, in our country and other countries and so on and how many tests, et cetera. So I think there are a few key things, uh, that we should be looking at. And there’s a, a important thing in my plan is, as I said, informed by scientists. First, we’re gonna make sure that testing is widely available and free because we learned early on there was a fear of people that if I go get a test, is it going to cost me all this money?

Speaker 3 (08:45):

How can I pay for it? What will I do? Um, and a free but available? And that everyone that needs a test could get it. And we to establish these mobile testing sites, we came up with the idea of at least 10 of these mobile testing sites per state and drive through facilities to speed testing as well as protect the healthcare workers because that’s a grave concern as you well know and developing concern. Secondly, from the experience I watched you and our military put together in Africa, the ability for us to be able to provide mobile hospitals, and I don’t just mean the two hospitals ships we have, they’re important, but mobile hospitals on the ground in places where you can determine ahead of time, there’s going to be a significant influx of people needing hospital beds and ICU units. And so we, uh, we talked about that FEMA in the U S military, I argued to be setting up these emergency hospitals that can be dropped in a parking lot or wherever they’re needed.

(09:52):

For example, now you know, there’s, there’s one being, you know, up in the Javits center, there’s three of them going up. Uh, this is a little late, but finally the governor got a, the white house to and, and the national guard to move. But my point is that providing for mobile hospitals, you don’t have to be, I, I’m obviously not a doctor either, but you don’t have to be a doctor and you don’t have to be clairvoyant to know where they’re going to need these hospitals. Um, and these additional beds I should say. And third thing I argued for is we were going to need to make sure that we’re protecting the doctors, nurses and all the healthcare workers on the front lines. That means the protective gear so that they can be safe, uh, as they protect coronavirus patients. You know, the president, we argued, I argued, I said had to in fact invoke the defense production act, which to the average American is, I guess a lot of mumbo jumbo.

It reminds me of another point with the flu comparisons. I hear some people say that 'Many of the infected would possibly have died anyway within the next year, etc.' But when we count flu deaths we don't discount the loss of life because there is a high chance they 'would possibly have gone anyway'. The whole point is that flu is one of the things which gave them a low chance of survival. And on top of that, coronavirus is an additional risk on top of all the existing risks. So whatever background risk there was as a 70 or 80 year old to survive the next year, that background risk has increased (significantly?) with the novel coronavirus.

If readers take that information and decide that it’s better for them to go to the grocery store twice a week versus four times, then that’s useful, not fear-mongering.

Years ago, while in the Army, a sergeant I was particularly fond of liked to say, “If you’re calm and collected while everyone else is losing their shit, perhaps you just don’t understand the situation.” With that in mind, I’d advise you to not be so judgmental regarding people’s reaction to dealing with something that’s been proven to be highly contagious and increasingly deadly. This isn’t an issue of conformity, obedience, or freedom of thought, because the virus doesn’t care about your or anyone else’s politics: if “social spacing” becomes a code word for “liberalism”, and ignoring it becomes a code word for “owning the libs”, I’m pretty sure the virus will be more than happy to take advantage of the ignorance of conservatives."

I'm not trying to incite a panic and it would indeed be great if the virus is indeed not as virulent as expected. (In fact, I personally do believe the final IFR will end up in the \~0.4% area, much lower than the worst-case expectations, but still at least 10x more severe than 2009 pandemic) But I think it is dangerous to cite aggregated all-cause mortality across all of Europe, because the disaggregated data in hard-hit areas is increasingly worrying."

If you don’t fall into those guidelines you can make a “clinical” diagnosis.  Essentially, if you are a healthy 25 year old who lives in a single apartment and have a fever of 101 and cough and come in you won’t get a COVID-19 test.  Most likely get a flu test and strep test.

- Proposing a 2021 budget that cuts the CDC budget in the midst of a global outbreak
- Telling people it's fine to go to work while sick
- Claiming a flu vaccine can treat the coronavirus
- Claiming a vaccine will be ready in months when his top advisers (experts) say a year at best

Many states that have shut down businesses are permitting food vendors to continue operating for takeout and delivery only.

This approach tracks with what I have seen about transmittal - it seems to be mainly respiratory (based on the clusters of infections). The main concerns cited about takeout/delivery are about exposure of people to other people and contaminated surfaces, not concerns about the actual ingestion of food that may have been contaminated. And I understand that the virus is unlikely to infect via the gastro intestinal route.

Nonetheless, I’m curious about why this is not seen as a potential risk when touching contaminated surfaces is being stressed so much.

[This link](https://www.seriouseats.com/2020/03/food-safety-and-coronavirus-a-comprehensive-guide.html) is the most comprehensive review of it I’ve seen, but it’s from a non-medical source.

Any thoughts on: 

1. The general safety of ordering no-contact delivery food 

2. If delivery food stored in fridge (e.g. leftovers that are not heated up) have the potential to harbor the virus (or enough of the virus to be infectious) 

3. If micro-aspirating food (which humans do regularly) or otherwise getting infected food into the lower respiratory tract would pose a risk for infection with Covid-19"

The state's interest in preventing the spread of a deadly and highly infectious disease is undeniably a compelling one.  And the restrictions are narrowly tailored in that they prevent only in-person gatherings on a temporary basis.  There's not a way for the state to exempt the religious gathering while still achieving its compelling purpose because coronavirus spreads as easily at religious gatherings as any other sort of gathering.  

Moreover, this doesn't stop either assembly or religious activity - just an in-person gathering of a large number of people.  The church could still conduct its services online, for example.

This is honestly a test of how willfully blind one group of people can be. Will you kill people with your stubbornness and ignorance or will you wake up and realize how bad this is? So far there seems to be the same kind of denial about this as there has been about global warming. The difference is this virus will kill millions of people if we do not change our behavior now.

Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, says some indicators, such as the numbers of new hospital admissions per day, suggest the spread does ""appear to be slowing down a little bit"".
He told the BBC's Today programme that the numbers hadn't ""plateaued"" yet and were still increasing each day, ""but the rate of that increase has slowed"".
However, he added that this pattern hadn't been reflected in the number of deaths - but these usually lagged a long way behind."

Censoring physicists' work and creativity is not the solution. In fact, this could stop novel ideas and theories from being seen that could end up saving lives (even accidentally). Physics is in essence an approach to understanding and predicting the way the world works - [it is not restricted by subject matter](http://m.nautil.us/issue/35/boundaries/why-physics-is-not-a-discipline). 

This censorship by appeal to specialised authority is not only dangerous when applied to physicists, but others as well. [These articles](https://medium.com/tomas-pueyo/coronavirus-articles-endorsements-fdc68614f8e3) on the pandemic were initially dismissed by many due to the author not being a trained epidemiologist and only having an MSc in engineering. The articles have since been endorsed by hundreds of academics, including epidemiologists. Many governments have enacted measures consistent with the articles' arguments, and they have likely had some influence in encouraging social distancing among the public. This positive influence would have been quashed if the author had taken your advice to only comment if they are a qualified epidemiologist.

The links in the chain that should be attacked (or better, educated) are the journalists, reporters and even some governments who sensationalise and misrepresent articles / academic papers and their conclusions. Promoting censorship of science and suppression of ideas is never the answer, and will lead us down a dangerous path. From the bottom of my heart and for the sake of science and progress via freedom of ideas, in your own words, **cut that shit out**."

By [HANNAH FRY](https://www.latimes.com/people/hannah-fry), [ALEX WIGGLESWORTH](https://www.latimes.com/people/alex-wigglesworth), [TARYN LUNA](https://www.latimes.com/people/taryn-luna) MARCH 30, 20209:29 AM

The California death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 133, with officials warning of tough weeks ahead as the [number of confirmed cases](https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/#nt=1PromoSuperLeadLarge-1col-7030col1-main)of the virus continues [to surge.](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-29/hospitals-california-coronavirus-cases-surge)

The latest death was reported Monday morning by San Francisco’s Department of Public Health. Details about the individual who died were not immediately available.

There are currently more than 6,400 confirmed cases of the virus in the state. Experts say California will likely continue to see a rise in new cases and deaths for the next few weeks as testing capacity increases but hope that the social distancing measures imposed can slow the spread.

The biggest immediate concern is for hospitals, which [risk being overwhelmed ](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-20/coronavirus-hospital-bed-icu-pandemic)by a growing number of sick patients. 

The number of COVID-19 patients in California’s intensive-care beds doubled overnight, from 200 on Friday to 410 on Saturday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. And the number of hospitalized patients testing positive for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, rose by 38.6% — from 746 on Friday to 1,034 on Saturday, he said.

“We’re blessed that we’re just at 410, devastating for the individuals there and their family members and loved ones,” Newsom said at a news conference in Sunnyvale on Saturday. “But by comparison and contrast to other parts of this country, that number seems relatively modest.”

A Los Angeles Times [data analysis](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-18/hospitals-are-straining-under-the-coronavirus-the-big-wave-coming-could-break-them) found that California had 7,200 intensive-care beds across more than 365 hospitals. In total, the state has more than 70,000 beds. There is roughly one intensive-care bed for every 5,500 people in California, Times data show.

About half of California’s total intensive-care beds — 3,700 — are in the five-county area around Los Angeles, according to data from 2018, the most recent available. In the nine-county Bay Area, there are roughly 1,400 ICU beds for a population of 7.6 million people.

Intensive-care beds allow for a higher level of treatment than regular beds, a level of care some COVID-19 patients require. Those unable to breathe properly may need a breathing tube and to be hooked up to [a ventilator, which physically pushes oxygen](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-26/coronavirus-ventilator-shortage-choice-health-care-doctors) into the lungs.

[Although a system overload](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-29/hospitals-california-coronavirus-cases-surge) remained the fear, one projection from University of Washington epidemiologists suggested that California’s 9-day-old stay-at-home order might keep the hospital strain below catastrophic levels. And Dr. Robert Kim-Farley, a UCLA epidemiologist, said Friday that after a considerable uptick in cases, “I think we should be able to see some leveling off of those numbers in a couple of weeks because of the physical distancing measures.”

UC Berkeley biostatistics professor Nicholas Jewell says California will soon learn whether its limits on work and public movement have paid dividends.

Because of a lag time of as much as two weeks between transmission of the illness and the onset of symptoms, gauging the benefits of physical distancing takes time. With California’s stay-at-home order less than 2 weeks old, people reporting the illness may have been infected prior to the limitations.

“We need another week or two to really tell if California’s fairly quick shelter in place did make a difference,” Jewell said. “It has the potential to make a huge difference. I know that mathematically … but I don’t know that with any degree of certainty.”

Authorities were out in force over the weekend to make sure people were [staying away from beaches](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-27/l-a-county-closes-all-beaches-to-stop-coronavirus-crowds), parks and hiking trails that were recently closed as part of unprecedented restrictions on public movements to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Many people obeyed the closures. One man, however, received a $1,000 citation [for surfing in Manhatthan Beach](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-29/hospitals-california-coronavirus-cases-surge) on Saturday after he ignored numerous warnings by police and lifeguards cautioning him not to go in the water.

A Ventura County Sheriff’s Department cruiser could be seen guarding the entrance to a popular trail in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, where hundreds of hikers and families descended Saturday. In Venice, a Los Angeles Police Department helicopter was seen circling a skate park, announcing that people who did not leave the area would be “arrested for trespassing.”

Los Angeles County recorded five more coronavirus deaths on Sunday, bringing the total to 37. The county now has at least 2,100 confirmed cases, including more than 300 reported Sunday. 

On Sunday, officials confirmed that [two San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department deputies and two firefighters](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-30/san-bernardino-county-sheriffs-deputies-firefighters-coronavirus) had tested positive for COVID-19. San Bernardino County had recorded 111 cases of the virus and three deaths as of Monday morning. In Orange County, 431 cases of the virus [have been reported](https://occovid19.ochealthinfo.com/coronavirus-in-oc), including four who died. 

More cases and deaths were reported elsewhere across California, with officials warning that numbers will spike in the coming weeks.

The [Navy hospital ship Mercy](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-27/mercy-hospital-ship-with-1-000-beds-arrives-in-l-a-to-help-with-coronavirus), which docked at the Port of Los Angeles on Friday, began receiving patients Sunday. The boat is operated by naval medical and support staff from 22 commands, along with 70 civil mariners, who will treat patients who don’t have COVID-19 in order to help reduce the strain on the hospital system.

There were three patients aboard the ship as of Sunday afternoon.

“The men and women embarked on board Mercy are energized, eager and ready to provide relief to those in need,” said Capt. John Rotruck, Mercy’s Military Treatment Facility commanding officer, in a news release."

Moreover, a [Japanese study](https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e/9407-covid-dp-fe-01.html) showed that of all the test-positive passengers, and despite the high average age, 48% remained *completely symptom-free; e*ven among the 80-89 year olds 48% remained symptom-free, while among the 70 to 79 year olds it was an astounding 60% that developed no symptoms at all.

2020-03-30,maalbi,Coronavirus,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fs4tai/why_mexico_has_so_few_cases_compared_with_the_us/flzfiam/,"MEXICO CITY — The U.S.-Mexico border has long been a region of contrasts. But people in both countries are puzzling over the latest one: The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the Mexican side is just a small fraction of the U.S. count.

On Sunday, confirmed cases in California topped 6,200, compared with just 23 in Baja California. Arizona had 919 cases, dwarfing the 14 in neighboring Sonora. New Mexico reported 237 cases; in Chihuahua state, there were six.

The U.S.-Mexico border is the busiest in the world, with an estimated 1 million legal crossings per day. The neighbors’ economies are intertwined.

So why is there such a big difference in cases?

The disparity reflects, in part, a time lag. Mexico did not report its first case until Feb. 27 — a month after the virus was detected in the United States. To date, the country has counted 993 cases, less than 1 percent of the U.S. total.

[Coronavirus collides with Latin America’s maid culture — with sometimes deadly results]

But Mexico is also pursuing an unorthodox strategy. It is relying less on tests, and more on its own disease modeling, to guide its response to the pandemic. As Central American neighbors declared emergencies in mid-March, Mexico kept its airports, shops and government offices open — the government didn’t urge a broad stay-at-home policy until last week.

Mexico’s approach amounts to a bet, its coronavirus czar acknowledges — “a bet that’s technically sound,” Hugo López-Gatell said in an interview. Authorities are wagering that they can fine-tune their response to the virus, even as it has outwitted health officials in the United States and Europe.

[Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.]

The stakes of that gamble are enormous. Mexico held off on harsh lockdown measures to allow citizens to work for a few more weeks. Nearly 60 percent of the labor force works in the informal sector — as plumbers, gardeners, taco vendors — and they have little or no savings.

Keeping those workers home when it’s not absolutely necessary, López-Gatell said, can cause “frightening damage.”



But if it turns out Mexico waited too long to introduce restrictions, analysts warn, it could suffer a crisis like Italy’s or New York’s — with far fewer resources. Mexico has half as many hospital beds per capita as the United States, and a quarter as many nurses, according to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

“The health system will be overloaded much faster” than in other countries, Eduardo González-Pier, a former Mexican deputy health minister, said last week in a briefing sponsored by the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington.

Turmoil in Mexico typically generates fears of spillover in the United States — surges in illegal migration and narcotics, snags in trade. At the moment, though, it is Mexicans who are worrying about crossover problems. On Saturday, governors of three Mexican border states called on President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to tighten controls to limit the arrival of the coronavirus from the United States.

Mexico has extensive experience with infectious diseases; it was the epicenter of the 2009 swine flu pandemic. But unlike many nations, it has not rushed to scale up testing. López-Gatell, a respected epidemiologist with a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University — an institution currently distinguishing itself with a widely cited website tracking the pandemic — acknowledged that Mexico’s official count does not reflect the real number of cases.

“Any country in the world that takes public health seriously knows there’s a portion of the epidemic that’s visible, and a portion that’s not visible,” he said.

How deep is the undercount? Academic studies estimate that there are 10 to 15 times as many common flu cases each year as reported, López-Gatell noted.

But the raw numbers aren’t the point, he maintained. What matters, he said, is identifying when and where the virus starts to grow exponentially. Figuring that out is a bit like conducting a presidential election poll, he said. “You don’t interview 300 million Americans,” he said. “There’s a scientific method to know what is the size” of the sample needed for an accurate survey.

From the start of the outbreak, Mexican authorities tested likely coronavirus carriers — people with symptoms such as fever and dry cough who had recently visited a country with known cases. When a diagnosis was confirmed, officials tried to track and isolate the victim’s contacts.

Authorities also watched for unusual spikes in seasonal flu cases. They didn’t spot any.

On March 24, Mexico declared that the virus had moved to a new phase and was spreading unchecked in communities.

Since then, monitoring stations around the country — in hospitals and primary-care centers — have been testing about 10 percent of suspected coronavirus patients with mild symptoms. Everyone with serious symptoms is tested, said López-Gatell.

“This allows you to have the information to construct estimates,” he said.

In total, Mexico has conducted about 65 tests per million inhabitants. That compares with 2,250 per million in the United States.

[Brazil’s Bolsonaro, channeling Trump, dismisses coronavirus measures — it’s just ‘a little cold’]

Mexico’s approach varies dramatically from the much-praised model of South Korea, which blunted the coronavirus curve through mass testing and aggressive tracking and isolation of victims and their contacts.



Carlos del Rio, an epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta, says Mexico has moved too slowly.

“Countries that have done [extensive] testing are doing better than those that don’t,” said del Rio, the former head of the National AIDS Council of Mexico.

Alejandro Macias, Mexico’s former national flu commissioner, said there was not enough early testing to confidently determine when community transmission began. “I don’t think there was enough of a budget,” he said.

Others say testing has been overemphasized.

“It’s as though doing tests will solve the problem. That’s not clear at all,” said Samuel Ponce de León, an infectious-disease specialist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “No one has been able to replicate” South Korea’s success, he said.
Of course, pinpointing when coronavirus cases started to explode was supposed to be only the first step in trying to tame the pandemic. The second was ordering tough measures to “flatten the curve” of illnesses and keep hospitals from being overwhelmed.

Mexico closed down schools and most government offices last week, and urged citizens to stay indoors. By Saturday, though, the movement of people in Mexico City had declined by only 30 percent, López-Gatell told reporters. He pleaded with Mexicans to stay home.

“This is our last chance,” he said.

If Mexicans haven’t gotten the message, it might be partly the fault of the messenger-in-chief. For weeks, even as health authorities called on citizens to refrain from kissing and hugging, López Obrador plunged into crowds of admirers, slapping backs and shaking hands. He has only recently stopped his rallies.

[Brazil’s densely packed favelas brace for coronavirus: ‘It will kill a lot of people.’]

State and local officials have criticized the federal government’s strategy. And there is plenty of skepticism about the case numbers.

But medical experts say there is little doubt there are more cases on the U.S. side of the border. Californians and Texans have more and closer ties with Europe and Asia — regions with big outbreaks — than people living in northern Mexico.

And in a telltale sign of the pandemic’s toll, Mexico has had just 20 deaths so far, compared with more than 2,500 for its northern neighbor.

If there were a dramatically higher number of cases, Ponce de León said, Mexican hospitals would be struggling with the same patient load currently overwhelming some U.S. hospitals. “And we don’t have that,” he said.

“We will have it,” he said. “But we’re at a different moment in the epidemic.”"

That said --  read this Thread about the Biden Claim. I have addressed this at length. 

Considering Biden never mentions the travel restriction, in his Feb1st tweet, and the Tweet was an echo of his January 31st speech, which was in turn an echo of his January 27th Op-ED (before the ban), it seems Biden was not talking about the January 31 Ban.

Jan. 31 speech - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiOKZ8ARmqM&feature=emb_logo -- around 7:45 mark is where he shifts to Cornavirus.

And if you listen to that segment -- and the list of complaints - i see nothing to suggest that the China Travel Ban(which came down the same day as that speech) was what he was calling Xenophobic. 

Biden says:
> ""we need a leader we can trust what he says and what he will do..no time for his record of xenophobia and fear-mongering."" (a claim of general record)

Biden (see 9:00 mark) talks about Cuts to domestic and INTERNATIONAL programs and ""GLOBAL HEALTH security"" -- and than says ""Diseases have no borders."" (ties into Xenophobia -- talking about working internationally, not this Ban)

It seems odd to me that when he starts listing the policy Trump enacted -- he never once mentions the ban if that is what he was talking about. Instead he lists several Global/International initiatives that Trump cut..which seems to be what he is talking about. (and it is almost the exact same wording as the below 27th article)

This 31st speech also echoed his January 27th OpEd (BEFORE THE TRAVEL BAN): https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/01/27/coronavirus-donald-trump-made-us-less-prepared-joe-biden-column/4581710002/.

It seems Biden was claiming Trumps' Xenophobia (and related isolationism) and Fear-Mongering IN GENERAL are problematic.

Countries around the world have brought their entire economies to a screeching halt. Why do you think that is? Have you not been paying attention to fucking anything?

Italy's hospitals are overrun to the point where doctors are choosing which patients will receive care based on their survivability – and which patients will be taken off ventilators. There isn't enough equipment or doctors to care for all of them.

Currently NYC hospitals are at 125% capacity (Elmhurst). There is a shortage of equipment, doctors, ventilators and hospitable beds.

Prior to Coronavirus, our hospitals ran at about 90% capacity here in the US. That means 100,000 open beds throughout the entire US (on a good day). However, we can expect millions of patients to reach severe condition – meaning they will require a hospital stay or ICU and assisted breathing (either oxygen or mechanical lung ventilator). It's our current action that will decide if all those patients flood the system at once, or gradually over time.

If we do everything right from this point on, the best case scenario is 100,000 die... that's best case with social distancing. Worst case is several million – and not all from COVID, that would include indirect deaths because patients who need treatment for other emergencies or trauma won't be able to get the treatment that they need because the healthcare system is beyond capacity.

>Is it safe to take ibuprofen to treat symptoms of COVID-19?
Some French doctors advise against using ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, many generic versions) for COVID-19 symptoms based on reports of otherwise healthy people with confirmed COVID-19 who were taking an NSAID for symptom relief and developed a severe illness, especially pneumonia. These are only observations and not based on scientific studies.
The WHO initially recommended using acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen to help reduce fever and aches and pains related to this coronavirus infection, but now states that either acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used. Rapid changes in recommendations create uncertainty. Since some doctors remain concerned about NSAIDs, it still seems prudent to choose acetaminophen first, with a total dose not exceeding 3,000 milligrams per day.
However, if you suspect or know you have COVID-19 and cannot take acetaminophen, or have taken the maximum dose and still need symptom relief, taking over-the-counter ibuprofen does not need to be specifically avoided."

On Sunday afternoon, a team of eight medical professionals flew to Tuba City to assess the medical situation and advise how they can make the most out of their remaining medical resources, a spokesperson said in a press release Monday.   


""The demand for medical resources outweighs what they have to fight this pandemic,"" U.S Army Col. Tom Leaper, the Arizona National Guard State Surgeon, said in the press release. 

A group of 19 soldiers arrived Sunday afternoon and worked overnight to establish a medical care facility in Chinle, Arizona.

The station holds about 50 beds that will be used as an overflow space for patients once hospitals reach capacity.

Leaper added in the release that the National Guard's purpose is to help with increasing the capacity of the health care system and ""assisting with the development of a sustainable approach utilizing civilian partners and stakeholder integration.""

Ever since [Gov. Doug Ducey called on the Arizona National Guard on March 19](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/03/19/gov-doug-ducey-orders-bars-theaters-gyms-closed-national-guard-help-stores/2881586001/) to help the state's response to the new coronavirus, the National Guard has focused on helping food banks and grocery stores. The mission with the Navajo Nation represents a pivot showing their ability to work in the health care system as well.

More than 1,000 Arizona Guard members have been activated to help the state's response to the new coronavirus, according to the release. "

Every year, around this time, I get hit with really bad allergies. With everything going on I'm getting so anxious and I tend to have phantom symptoms so I'm trying to vent and hear second thoughts to avoid this.

My allergies (and colds, too) always effect my lungs. In terms of upper respiratory symptoms, I will get kind of congested maybe a little bit of sneezing but normally my chest is hit really bad. I'm talking deep phlegm-y coughs, chest pain, and wheezing. 

The night before last, I slept with the window open and woke up to wheezing and coughing. I took a bronkaid and an allergy pill and that cleared up the wheezing and ultimately the coughing. I felt pretty good after though I did still kind of congested in the head and chest. I took another bronkaid before bed. I woke up relatively fine this morning. I had one moment where I wheezed but hasn't happened since. I took an allergy pill again to be safe.   


I'm feeling super anxious again today. Generally I'm an anxious person to begin with but one of the side effects of bronkaid is nervousness so it could be that, too. But I don't feel congested in the head but I am feeling some mild pain in the chest, especially when I breathe deeply. I'm breathing fine and I've been taking my temperature since yesterday morning and have been between 97.5-98.7. Haven't had any shortness of breath.  


I'm just not sure when to call a medical professional or if I should at all?  I think it's just allergies but I keep reading articles from people who kept thinking it was one thing and then all of the sudden they're near death with covid-19."

Additionally tuition is raised 3-5k per year. And as a student I don’t see where it’s going. On the positive side I love my close knit group of friends. I have had two summer internships and a full time job lined up (pending Coronavirus things) also mind you I had no hope from rpi in obtaining them. There are some great professors and not so great professors. There are many many clubs to get involved in. Like any school there are pros and cons. Honestly, I would have chosen somewhere else if I had to do it again but a lot of the reasons I would have done that are personal to me (seasonal depression and not a great social scene) and my major (nuclear engineering).

1. ""Yesterday"" is Mar 28th and today is Mar 29th, so the bar for Mar 28th can't be trusted and the chart was created before Mar 29th was even over, let alone before the numbers for Mar 29th came in.

As OP noted -- outside of repeated Right Wing claims  -- can you source this supposed claims of Racism by major Voices on the Left (media or politicians?) (about the travel Ban, not the recent ""chinese Flu"" issue.)

Some on the left did react stupidly to Trumps China ban. But overall -- Trump and Right Wing media overstate the ""controversy"" and ""racist"" labels around that move. (For example -- Trump and his allies spread a false claim about Schumer -- https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/29/tweets/chuck-schumer-didnt-delete-tweet-criticizing-trump/)

Overall -- The Complaint was not Racism. The compliant was that it was a minimally effective tool, that can actually be counter-productive,  and was nowhere near what was needed.  People did claim it can lead to Xenophobic reactions by public, but not that the move itself was racist.

That is the heart of nearly all the complaints  -- Trump repeatedly acted like closing the US to China was the solution. He did that one thing -- and then for the next month acted like it was done, and contained, and never going to be a threat to the the US.

I can find quotes form Dems supporting it -- such as Reps. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) and Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) on Feb. 4 -- but explicitly asking for more action:

https://delauro.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/lowey-delauro-urge-administration-request-emergency-funding-coronavirus

Trump, from early on, went at it alone and made little efforts to work with the World, WHO, China and our allies to address the problem globally. He also did little to prepare for when it did get here (and until March, kept insisting it would not be an issue in the US).

But instead, trump just enacted one protect-the-US band-aid.  Which most experts believed would do little -- which this month has shown is true.  Trump was not going to be able to keep the virus out of the US. Planning for what would happen when it got here, and for when it started quickly spreading globally was the proper approach."

Even if he didn't have any diagnosed conditions yet (given his young age), obesity is being linked with coronavirus death at a pretty high percentage. Apparently being overweight creates a cytokine storm that worsens symptoms and leads to respiratory shutdown.

It's not like if we just opened everything back up and let the virus do its worst, everything would be ok in terms of the economy and society. If hospitals get overwhelmed and people are dying, kids start dying or mothers in childbirth because the resources are overwhelmed, there will be disorder and rioting and the economy will suffer anyway as people will be afraid and angry.

I think it's naive to think that avoiding a lock down could possibly save more lives in the long run.

It's a shit situation, whatever happens it will be shit, there's no escaping that.

We're also destined to see various *very* important technological shifts, things that might not be immediately obvious this year or even next year, but by 2030 will make 2020 a sort of ""Before and After"" sort of year.

Really, the potential aftereffects are virtually unlimited at the moment and we won't know until they happen.

Like, imagine if it was H1N1 itself that caused the Great Recession. It would've made that outbreak less of a GFC-era footnote and more of a ""Header in Every Modern History Textbook"" sort of thing. 

That's what coronavirus is. God only knows how this affects relations with China; it could sour them overwhelmingly, but if it turns out that the USA and UK bungled our responses too badly, we might all be answering to Chinese owners in a few years. 

But again, the recession we're in now ([as declared by the IMF](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/imf-head-global-economy-now-recession-69843184)) alone makes coronavirus a historic event. So I can't agree with your assertion."

1. Penalties and late fees will not be assessed on business licenses that become due during April, May or June 2020 (this may be extended)

2. The status of the business license will be not be changed to Delinquent status for license fees that become due during April, May or June 2020 (this may be extended)

I'm South Asian (Indian descent) myself, so maybe what works for you may not work for me and vice versa. 😊 
I'm posting part of a comment I posted on r/weightlossadvice just today; hopefully it's of any use! Also I'm 23 and medically overweight (F, 5'5"" 168 lbs). 

1. Intermittent fasting. Currently doing 16:8 (but today I felt faint so I had to eat past the 8 hours.) Want to make my way to one meal a day! (OMAD) 

2. Plant based whole foods, as much as possible. r/vegan1200isplenty is great! Since I'm of South Asian descent, I personally don't think keto is good for me because my genetics make me prone to cardiovascular problems anyways. Maybe it could work for you if you want something different from keto!

3. Green tea is great when water gets bland. I soak 6 tea bags in a jug of water overnight and it lasts me 2 days. 

4. Jump rope when I can. Honestly even just walking and puttering around is good!

5. Meditation, and keeping calm throughout the day makes me reach for junk less. 

6. There's an awesome book called 'Body Weight Strength Training Anatomy' by Bret Contreras. It details how you work out each skeletal muscle group using your body weight or everyday home items like a towel! I downloaded it from an open-source website called Library Genesis (go to its Wikipedia page for links to it). I will be using this book's advice as soon as I get settled into my study routine amid this coronavirus self-isolation situation. This could help you slowly gain some upper body muscle right at home. 
 
7. To keep it 100, I follow certain threads for inspiration on how my body can/should look once I achieve a healthy weight. In particular, r/gentlemanboners has no nudity and, as far as I know, unphotoshopped bodies of a wide range of female celebs. Even though I don't see that much POC representation unfortunately, it still gets the job done. Maybe Instagram can be better for representation, but I know that they tend to Photoshop their images moreso than paparazzi. Whatever works! 👍

8. I am looking more into beautification routines like makeup and hairstyling to replace the junk food habit I had. So I still get a boost of dopamine without eating more calories than I need."

Trying to go to sleep but my sofa won’t stop coughing

Because when I watch the masked singer I cringe when they’re unmasked
I even ran out of lean cuisines 
Which I bathed in bleach
I’ve come down to my last peach
7 billion people on earth
Now I’m scared of each
I can’t even make a sandwich cause I can’t touch things
But I guess the advantage is the weight loss it brings
Can’t even go to the store
I mean that didn’t change much cause I’ve always been poor
But still
I would like to get out more 
Because now life is a bore
Laying down on the floor asking people to pour rubbing alcohol on me some more until I’m clean to my core
This isn’t a joke there is no humour
People spread the coronavirus like a rumour 
Now I can no longer be a consumer
I’m only wearing a hazmat suit and crawling around in stealth because I care about your health
I need a medic
Cause Im sick of this pandemic 
Quarantined at home
I hear the virus is near
That’s my greatest fear
Guess I’ll keep sitting here alone hoping that the virus will clear
Once it does I will cheer
But continue to worry about the next pandemic to appear from a dirty cashier who hates her career and decided to smear poop from a deer on my can of diet root beer now a new pandemic kills the entire hemisphere in one year"

Sure, they have to own part of the responsibility too for the feature not being enabled on the watch yet but the FDA in the US and Health Canada here in Canada (and their global equivalents) have to also approve the ECG sensor research before they can allow Samsung to turn it on. If you're saying it's their fault for releasing the watch and advertising the ECG feature without it being approved at the time of launch, are you saying that it was Apple's fault when the did the same with the launch of the Apple Watch Series 4? The ECG feature on the Apple Watch Series 4 wasn't enabled at launch and it took a long time before the FDA approved it and took months more before Health Canada approved it. Then again, like you, I'm upset that the ECG sensor isn't enabled and I have contacted Samsung Canada about it but at this point, quite frankly, Health Canada has a more important matter on their hands with the Coronavirus showing no signs of slowing down. I bought the watch because I was excited about the ECG function only for it to get delayed indefinitely. I messaged Samsung Canada a few weeks ago and they said it could come to Canada at some point. Heck, it was supposed to be available in the US right about now and it's nowhere to be seen. Keep in mind, the Apple Watch ECG function was approved and enabled a few years ago now but Apple Watch users in some countries are getting the feature now. I really hope they find a way to get the feature approved soon but at this point, wouldn't it be more appropriate to cut them some slack?

Tribune. La pandémie de coronavirus, d’ampleur totalement inédite, a pris de court la plupart des pays. Peu d’entre eux étaient prêts à encaisser une vague épidémique majeure. Il en existe pourtant au moins un qui avait su mettre au point un dispositif de protection très ambitieux contre des pandémies de cette ampleur. Et ce pays c’est… la France de 2007 ! Malheureusement, ce dispositif a été progressivement désarmé pour diverses raisons. Retour sur un épisode et une institution peu connue de notre histoire récente, l’établissement de préparation et de réponse aux urgences sanitaires (Eprus).

**Des faiblesses révélées par la crise H5N1**

A la suite de l’épidémie de grippe aviaire (H5N1) de 2006 et à l’initiative du sénateur Francis Giraud (1932-2010), le gouvernement de l’époque a fait adopter, en mars 2007, une loi au titre prémonitoire : « Loi relative à la préparation du système de santé à des menaces sanitaires de grande ampleur ».

Elle comportait deux dispositions essentielles. D’abord, la création du fameux corps de réserve sanitaire, sur lequel on ne s’attardera pas ici, et, ensuite, celle d’un nouvel établissement public, l’établissement de préparation et de réponse aux urgences sanitaires (Eprus), dont la mission principale était « l’acquisition, la fabrication, l’importation, le stockage, la distribution et l’exportation des produits et services nécessaires à la protection de la population face aux mesures sanitaires graves », y compris bien sûr les vaccins et les fameux masques chirurgicaux et FFP2 ! La crise H5N1 avait en effet mis en évidence diverses faiblesses dans la réponse logistique de l’Etat.

Les moyens dévolus à cette toute petite structure (17 agents en 2007 et 30 en 2015), cofinancée par l’Etat et l’Assurance-maladie, étaient considérables. On ne résiste pas à l’envie de citer l’inventaire estimé à un milliard d’euros qu’en fait l’exposé des motifs de la loi :
70 millions de vaccins antivarioliques et autant d’aiguilles, embouts et pipettes ; 81,5 millions de traitements d’antibiotiques en cas d’attaque bioterroriste de charbon, peste ou tularémie ; 11,7 millions de traitements antiviraux et 11,5 tonnes de substance active (oseltamivir) en cas de pandémie grippale ; 285 millions de masques de filtration de type FFP2 et 20 millions de boîtes de 50 masques chirurgicaux (soit le milliard de masques après lequel le ministre de la santé, Olivier Véran, court aujourd’hui) ; 2 100 respirateurs et bouteilles d’oxygène ; 20 équipements de laboratoires d’analyse (automates PCR et extracteurs ADN/ARN) ; 11 000 tenues de protection NRBC et accessoires.

Lors de ses vœux à la presse, le 22 janvier 2007, Xavier Bertrand, alors ministre de la santé et des solidarités, ne manquait pas de le faire savoir : « Nous poursuivons nos efforts de préparation à la survenue d’une éventuelle pandémie, grâce à la constitution de stocks de masques et de vaccins. Nous serions, d’après certains observateurs, parmi les pays les mieux préparés au monde. » Son successeur Olivier Véran aurait du mal à tenir le même discours avec son stock d’Etat réduit à 120 millions de masques chirurgicaux et à zéro masque FFP2 !"

And I assume alot of other places as well

There are a number of limitations to reporting that data.

Here's why:

In Georgia, we don’t have a good system already in place to track recoveries.

When you get the flu, and get better, you don’t pick up the phone and say, “Doc! I’m recovered!” The only way we know recovered cases right now is if the patient was released from the hospital.

Lots of people will get the virus without being hospitalized. Their recovery will likely not be officially documented.

Medical privacy laws - like HIPPA - can prevent individual hospitals or medical groups from releasing that information to the public right now.

We would need the state to require this kind of reporting, and medical facilities to start collecting it

2020-03-30,CollateralEstartle,moderatepolitics,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/fs4kv7/the_socialdistancing_culture_war_has_begun/flzet65/,"The basic premise of this article is that there's a difference in both views about and adherence to social distancing guidelines depending on political party:

>For a brief moment earlier this month, it seemed as if social distancing might be the one new part of American life that wasn’t polarized along party lines. Schools were closed in red states and blue; people across the political spectrum retreated into their home. Though President Donald Trump had played down the pandemic at first, he was starting to take the threat more seriously—and his media allies followed suit. Reminders to wash your hands and avoid crowds became commonplace on both Fox News and MSNBC. Those who chose to ignore this guidance—the spring-breakers clogging beaches, the revelers on Bourbon Street—appeared to do so for apolitical reasons. For the most part, it seemed, everyone was on the same page.

>The consensus didn’t last long. Trump, having apparently grown impatient with all the quarantines and lockdowns, began last week to call for a quick return to business as usual. “we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,” he tweeted, in characteristic caps lock. Speaking to Fox News, he added that he would “love” to see businesses and churches reopened by Easter. Though Trump would later walk them back, the comments set off a familiar sequence—a Democratic backlash, a pile-on in the press, and a rush in MAGA-world to defend the president. As the coronavirus now emerges as another front in the culture war, social distancing has come to be viewed in some quarters as a political act—a way to signal which side you’re on.

The article goes on to suggest that if the politicization of the guidelines continues, it could be hard to get people hostile to them for political reasons to comply.  

I think this raises a couple of interesting questions:

1. In states (like TX) where lockdowns have mostly been left to the discretion of local leaders, will we see faster growth of cases in redder areas?  

2. How can social distancing be depoliticized so that politics doesn't play a role in spreading the disease faster?

3. If states or localities engage in different levels of restrictions based on political views, how can areas that impose more restrictions keep themselves from being reinfected by areas that do less to fight the virus?  Should the level of restrictions be federalized, so that we don't get pockets of disease in areas that don't make efforts to fight it?"

And if the EU intend to give us what we want then they can do so very quickly and agreement can be reached this year.



Firstly its a negotiation, we want things, they want things, we will get some of what we want, they will get some of what they want and the rest will be down to what we both sides can live with and that takes time and concentration both of which are in short term supply at the moment. 

>Secondly, different people do different jobs. Those who are dealing with the coronavirus crisis are not the same people who would take part in these negotiations.


Secondly those people doing the negotiations are not immune from the corona virus or its effect, nor are all the people they have to have contact with, nor are the industries they have to check with, nor are the governments that are kind of busy trying to stop theirs populations dieing and economies from collapsing. 

>And thirdly, your views about the UK show what a little Englander, Britain-hater, you are. We are the most important and powerful country in Europe. We can make demands and walk away if we don't get what we want. No-deal suits us fine. The EU, on the other had, are clearly very concerned about this ...


Thirdly, no I'm not, no we aren't, no we can't, no it is doesn't and not right now they're not."

Q: Am I eligible for benefits if I am an independent contractor?

A: Individuals whose income is only from self-employment or work as an independent contractor will not be eligible for reemployment assistance benefits. 

However, if an independent contractor or self-employed individual also received wages through services performed as an employee (i.e., they had another job with an employer) during the base period (first 12 months of the past 15 months), he or she may be eligible for reemployment assistance benefits.

---

The CARES act will allows freelancer, gig workers (Airbnb hosts, Uber, Lyft drivers) to apply for unemployment soon. The department of labor is still working out the logistics for independent contractors.

2020-03-30,CollateralEstartle,moderatepolitics,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/frtpyp/the_trump_narrative_about_the_early_effectiveness/fly4of4/,"The claim is not that the ban itself was a bad idea, but that Trump's ""we'll just ban the foreigners and then we don't need to do anything at home"" attitude let the virus get completely out of control in the US.  

For example, [until February 27th the CDC only allowed testing of people who had symptoms **AND** had either (1) been to China or (2) been around someone who had been lab-tested positive](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-coronavirus-testing-problems-timeline-2020-3#the-fda-began-allowing-academic-hospital-labs-to-develop-and-use-their-own-coronavirus-tests-on-february-29-10).  In effect, those restrictions meant that any test had to chain back through a series of tests to someone who had been to China.  Someone with all the symptoms of coronavirus could be dying in a hospital, and they wouldn't be tested unless there was a chain of tests back to China.

That meant that the US was [effectively blinding itself to the possibility that the test was spreading among people who hadn't been to China.](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1233971005107785728) And by the time the US lifted those self-imposed restrictions on testing, the virus was already widespread.  

And since we're citing Dr. Fauci, it's worth pointing out that even he said of the US testing fiasco ""[It is a failing. Let's admit it](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/it-failing-let-s-admit-it-fauci-says-coronavirus-testing-n1157036).""

That's not to say that all of the fuck-ups with this administration's response can be blamed on treating this as a Chinese issue - there are fuck-ups aplenty.  Too many to fit into one reddit post.  

But the restrictions on testing only people with a link to China was pointless and immeasurably costly to this country.  And that can be laid squarely at the feet of xenophobia."
