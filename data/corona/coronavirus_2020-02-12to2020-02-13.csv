The coronavirus suspicion in the case of the nurse from Reșița, who took care of several people infected with this virus in Munich, was denied.  


Adrian Streinu-Cercel, the director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Matei Balș"", announced on Wednesday evening that the man has no infection with coronavirus, but a seasonal rhinitis, according to the results of the analyzes to which he was subjected.  


""The patient is not infected with coronavirus. (...) The patient had an infection, a seasonal rhinitis, which he contacted somewhere, ""said the manager of the Institute of Infectious Diseases"" Matei Balș "", according to Mediafax.  


The Romanian worked as a nurse in Germany and cared for four people who had the virus, but he was properly equipped when he came in contact with the patients.  


The man returned to the country on February 7, with his parents from Reșița, visited his sister, at Gărâna, and went skiing at Semenic, in Caraș-Severin.  


The nurse started to feel sick on Tuesday, presenting with fever, mild cough, symptoms specific to coronavirus infection, so she went to the hospital. The doctor caring for him said he had done more tests. The flu test came out negative, so on Wednesday night the coronavirus test went negative.  


He is now quarantined in the hospital in Timișoara.  


Several medical professionals from the Resita County Emergency Hospital who came in contact with the medical assistant were quarantined as a precautionary measure, and the young man's family is also monitored.  
More than 1,100 people died after being infected with coronavirus  


The total number of cases in mainland China has so far reached 1,113 deaths and infected 44,653 people, according to Chinese health authorities.  


Outside mainland China, the virus has so far led to the deaths of only two people, one from the Philippines and one from Hong Kong, in both cases being Chinese citizens.  


The director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, made the announcement on Tuesday that the official name of the coronavirus in China is Covid-19. The name comes from ""coronavirus disease that was discovered in 2019"", according to explanations provided by WHO representatives.  


The coronavirus appeared in central China in December 2019, in Wuhan City, which has a population of 11 million. Experts say the new virus is less fatal than SARS, but has a greater potential for spread."

* **Feb. 12, 2020Updated** **3:41 p.m. ET**

Some of the coronavirus testing kits sent to states and to at least 30 other countries have flaws and do not work properly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.

The kits were meant to enable states to conduct their own testing and get results faster than they would by shipping samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta. But the failure of the kits means that states still have to depend on the C.D.C., which will mean several days’ delay in getting results.

The C.D.C. [announced last week](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0206-coronavirus-diagnostic-test-kits.html) that it had begun shipping about 200 kits to laboratories in the United States and roughly 200 more to labs in more than 30 other countries. Each kit can test about 700 to 800 specimens from patients, the agency said.

Officials have not said how many of the kits are flawed.

On trial runs in some states, the kits produced results that were “inconclusive,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news conference on Wednesday.

“Things may not always go as smoothly as we may like,” Dr. Messonnier said.

She said the C.D.C. was working closely with the states, and would send out new ingredients to laboratories that have encountered the problem.

There have been 13 confirmed cases of the infection in patients in the United States so far. About 850 evacuees have been quarantined at military bases after returning from China. Still others are under self-quarantine at their homes.

The flawed test kits are a separate issue from the [mislabeled samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/san-diego-coronavirus-patient.html) in San Diego that led officials to discharge from the hospital a woman who was sick from the coronavirus.

Two of the eleven people hospitalized in France after having been contaminated by the new coronavirus are ""cured"" and left the hospital, and no new case has been detected in France for the moment, announced Wednesday the Ministry of Health.

It is about the Chinese couple of thirty-years-old who were hospitalized at the Bichat hospital in Paris, specified the number 2 of the ministry, Jerome Salomon, at a press conference.

The couple, a 31-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, were among the first cases on French soil, announced on January 24. They arrived in France on 18 January.

They came out of Bichat ""smiling"" and ""satisfied with their care,"" Salomon said, saying a cured patient requires no special follow-up.

Other outings ""in the next few days"".
Exit criteria are based on an ""extremely safe protocol"" which is the subject of an ""international consensus"": symptoms (fever, cough...) must have disappeared and ""two negative tests"" are required within 24 hours to ensure that these patients are no longer contagious.

Other outings among the first cases will take place ""in the next few days"", according to Professor Salomon.

Nine patients still hospitalized in France
After these two discharges, nine patients remain hospitalized in France: one in Bordeaux, two in Bichat (including an 80-year-old Chinese in a still ""severe"" condition) and one at the Pitié Salpêtrière in Paris, plus the five British patients who were contaminated by a fellow countryman in a chalet in Les Contamines-Montjoie (Haute-Savoie).

The 61 tests carried out in Haute-Savoie are negative, and there is no ""chain of transmission"" that has been set up from the people contaminated by the Briton, Professor Salomon said.

""As a precautionary measure"", three schools remain closed and ""many people remain in confinement at home"".

Negative tests in Carry-le-Rouet
In addition, all the tests have also been negative for the 216 French nationals in quarantine at a holiday resort in Carry-le-Rouet, some 30 kilometres from Marseille, since their repatriation from Wuhan.

""Everything is going well for them and they are preparing for the end of their fortnight,"" said Salomon.

The 180 people who arrived on the first plane, January 31, will leave on Friday, followed on Sunday by those who arrived on February 2.

In addition, some 80 people who have been in confinement since February 2 at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Officiers de Sapeurs-Fompiers (Ensosp) in Aix-en-Provence will also be released on Sunday, according to Salomon. There are French nationals and about 15 other nationalities.

""All these people have been tested several times,"" he said.

500 cases of contamination outside China
Thirty-five other French nationals have also been in the Aix premises since their repatriation on 9 February. They ""all tested negative"" and will be ""tested again in the next few days,"" Professor Salomon concluded.

The disease caused by the new coronavirus, now called ""Covid-19"" by the World Health Organization (WHO), has caused 1,113 deaths in China, according to Chinese health authorities, out of a total of 44,653 infected people listed in mainland China. 

Outside China, nearly 500 cases of contamination and two deaths have been confirmed in some 30 countries and territories.

We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6.

 I'm against the use of bad logic (From WHO press confrence earlier as stated in the thread starter), but I'm all ears as to how we plan to detect this at the community level. As stated elswhere, I am not saying that there are rampant cases undetected, just that the mecanisms to detect those potential cases are obscure at the very least and not covered by crises communication.

>People on this sub like to act like the CDC is a bunch of idiots.

At the very least, the CDC would like to do more testing but for some technical reasons can't. See this article : [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/labs-scramble-spot-hidden-coronavirus-infections](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/labs-scramble-spot-hidden-coronavirus-infections) and quote from CDC Wendi Kuhnert-Tallman : “We’re not able to do the surveillance that we would want to do”.

I see three possible options:

a) The employee had been tested before, and the test came out negative. This is inline with what we know about tests not being very reliable. We may expect more employees testing positive in the future.

b) He was not tested before, which would imply that he was not registered as being in close contact with the initial cases. So either they missed something in their tracking, or he got infected through someone not involved in the initial cases. Was it some other employee? Someone else in the city?

c) These are the results of the pending tests mentioned above. This is unlikely, since it would imply that it took them more than 10 days to know the results. Additionally, a 33-year-old man was announced to be positive just on the day after that press release."

“Things may not always go as smoothly as we may like,” Dr. Messonnier said.

By [Denise Grady](https://www.nytimes.com/by/denise-grady)

* Feb. 12, 2020 Updated 3:41 p.m. ET

Some of the coronavirus testing kits sent to states and to at least 30 other countries have flaws and do not work properly, the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.

The  kits were meant to enable states to conduct their own testing and get results faster than they would by shipping samples to the C.D.C. in  Atlanta. But the failure of the kits means that states still have to depend on the C.D.C., which will mean several days’ delay in getting  results.

The C.D.C. [announced last week](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0206-coronavirus-diagnostic-test-kits.html) that it had begun shipping about 200 kits to laboratories in the United  States and roughly 200 more to labs in more than 30 other countries.  Each kit can test about 700 to 800 specimens from patients, the agency said.

Officials have not said how many of the kits are flawed.

On trial runs in some states, the kits produced results that were  “inconclusive,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news conference on  Wednesday.

“Things may not always go as smoothly as we may like,” Dr. Messonnier said.

She  said the C.D.C. was working closely with the states, and would send out new ingredients to laboratories that have encountered the problem.

There have been 13 confirmed cases of the infection in patients in the United  States so far. About 850 evacuees have been quarantined at military bases after returning from China. Still others are under self-quarantine at their homes.

The flawed test kits are a separate issue from the [mislabeled samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/san-diego-coronavirus-patient.html) in San Diego that led officials to discharge from the hospital a woman who was sick from the coronavirus.

More than 1,100 people have died, nearly all of them in China, where there are more than 44,000 confirmed cases."

Not every coronavirus hews to the same rules. For instance, the one that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has not shown the capacity to spread easily from person to person, says Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security: ""It doesn't have that seasonality because it's really an animal to human virus and not something that that you see causing disease in a seasonal pattern.""

But he says COVID-19 seems more akin to the seasonal cold. And up to a third of common colds are caused by coronaviruses.

""We've seen, basically, explosive spread inside China of person-to-person transmission, so — in that sense — it really is behaving like a common-cold causing coronavirus,"" says Adalja.

For that reason, he says, ""I do think seasonality will play a role. As this outbreak unfolds and we approach spring and summer, I do think we will see some tapering off of cases.""

""It's not unreasonable to make the assumption"" that cases will die down come spring, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NPR. ""We hope when the weather gets warmer it will diminish a bit,"" he says.

Here is, to my knowledge, how censorship affects your life in China: 

Inquiry certain touchy topics via search engines will return nothing. You get a blank page, with fine print stating that what you searched is in violation of regulations.   

Posting anti-CCP statements on Weibo (the Chinese twitter) and WeChat (the Chinese messenger/Snapchat) is, surprisingly, okay. I have seen some users consistently spreading really spicy speeches online for years with impunity. **BUT**, there are also confirmed cases where certain Weibo users were reported for their posts and subsequently were arrested. I remember the most recent occurrence of this nature was that a Chinese Wechat user posted something that goes like ""I hope the coronavirus kill more Chinese people"" and was soon reported by other users and later swiftly arrested by police.

Online forums and public games usually would implement their own versions of censorship, so on some venues, your post/chat might be riddled with asterisks and dots, while on others you can publish long proses without a single asterisk in it. At least in the two Chinese forums that I frequent, we can talk about whatever we want, and from time to time people do criticize the govt on those forums. The worst that can happen to your criticisms is that your posts, when reported by other users, get deleted by forum moderators. I have yet to hear anyone from the two forums who is arrested as a result of badmouthing the CCP. (On an unrelated topic: I used to play Battlefield V and I would say that its chat censorship would leave its Chinese counterparts in shames. At least the Chinese censorship still saves me the freedom to swear in Chinese. It is so difficult to be a pouty mouth in BFV).

As for the Great Firewall: VPNs are really affordable and easy to use in China. I personally think that the GFW is stupid, but at least am glad that there are ways to get around it. 

Roughly half of the Chinese population (1.4 billion) are active internet users. Imagine censoring at least billions of online posts/chats/tweets/publications on a daily basis. If you are hellbent on getting yourself into trouble, you really have to amplify your voice and be extra zealous in your anti-CCP speech so as to stand out amongst half a billion internet users and get the spotlight from the govt.

So basically, you are free and not free in the Chinese cyberspace. Just don't go out of your way to be edgy and piss the govt, which reserves the right to bring you in for tea."

Fact is, there is a standard set of steps the Chinese police go through with this sort of thing. First is automated censorship, then if you repeatedly violate that you get a non-automated warning, then if you violate that, you get detained. Once the wider public stops talking/caring, you're released. That's it. Probably also worth noting that the whole process only kicks off if you're getting any attention; there's way too many people talking about way too much stuff to track everyone. If nobody cares, the government doesn't either. 

It's all very formulaic and predictable, and stops well short of death. I can't think of a single person under the modern CCP that actually got executed over something they said."

Simply put: COVID19 probably spreads like SARS, including the oral-fecal route. The bugs may go into your anus I guess lol but touching surfaces exposed to poop (toilet surface, or any bathroom area where aerosolized drops - from flushing- could fall onto surfaces and they contain POOP and if you touch them and then don't wash your hands and rub your nose or eat...you get infected.  Soiled surfaces (even if not visible) are called fomites.

Updated 3:41 p.m. ET

Some of the coronavirus testing kits sent to states and to at least 30 other countries have flaws and do not work properly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.

The kits were meant to enable states to conduct their own testing and get results faster than they would by shipping samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta. But the failure of the kits means that states still have to depend on the C.D.C., which will mean several days’ delay in getting results.

The C.D.C. announced last week that it had begun shipping about 200 kits to laboratories in the United States and roughly 200 more to labs in more than 30 other countries. Each kit can test about 700 to 800 specimens from patients, the agency said.

Officials have not said how many of the kits are flawed.

On trial runs in some states, the kits produced results that were “inconclusive,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news conference on Wednesday.

“Things may not always go as smoothly as we may like,” Dr. Messonnier said.

She said the C.D.C. was working closely with the states, and would send out new ingredients to laboratories that have encountered the problem.

There have been 13 confirmed cases of the infection in patients in the United States so far. About 850 evacuees have been quarantined at military bases after returning from China. Still others are under self-quarantine at their homes.

The flawed test kits are a separate issue from the mislabeled samples in San Diego that led officials to discharge from the hospital a woman who was sick from the coronavirus.

More than 1,100 people have died, nearly all of them in China, where there are more than 44,000 confirmed cases.



The Coronavirus Outbreak
What do you need to know? Start here.
Updated Feb. 10, 2020

What is a Coronavirus?
It is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.
How contagious is the virus?
According to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures.
Where has the virus spread?
The virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries.
How worried should I be?
While the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat.
Who is working to contain the virus?
World Health Organization officials have praised China’s aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance.
What if I’m traveling?
The United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights.
How do I keep myself and others safe?
Washing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you’re sick."

The best thing is to be vigilant when in public and make sure you are cleaning your hands regularly. Whenever I went somewhere I’d make sure to use a hand sanitizer, wear gloves (cold weather) put a scarf over my mouth. 
I know it’s not the most effective approach but I’m not going to let this virus stop me from living my life. I still need to get to work, go on public transport etc... 

When I went back to Budapest Airport I saw a group of Chinese people all wearing face masks, it is scary and a worry but so far I feel ok and trying to make sure my hands are at least as clean as they can be or if I randomly touch my face.

It helps ease my anxiety about it and it’s nice knowing I’m not alone. I can’t tell you how thankful I am. My family doesn’t understand my concern and brush it off.

I am a lurker (or really Ex-lurker) of a few of the Coronavirus subreddits. While it is somewhat good to read the info on there, the amount of doom and gloom on most of them were enough to make me extremely anxious, despite there being no known cases in my state so far. While I can understand and won’t discredit their hmm.. ‘pessimistic’ outlook on the virus (hell I’m still somewhat worried), I do feel like some were taking it to the extreme. Many people would say that we’re doomed and stuff like that, which made me very scared. Not to mention some of the conspiracies. Nearly everything on there was bad news. Even the somewhat good news would be reduced to ‘false hope’ and etc and it made me sleepless for a few nights. 

I recently discovered this megathread and my anxiety decreased greatly. It’s so hard to find good news involving this virus, or rather many people tend to only report or pay attention to the bad news. It has made me somewhat hopeful during this whole situation. I am still a little worried but I am way better than how I was before.

So, again, thank you! I would also like to thank BaconFace, one of the main contributors of good news on here! And thank you to others who have mentioned things and I apologize for not being able to recognize you. I have decided to check this megathread a few times a day, completely stop looking at the subreddits focused on the virus and to only check news involving it about two times a day.

[https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

I refresh this a few times a day. I look at the big numbers first - total confirmed cases, total deaths, total recovered. I then look at the graph at the bottom right. Is the orange line (Mainland China cases) plateauing? Is the green line (recovered cases) trending up? Is the yellow line (international cases) staying flat? Yes, yes and yes. All good news.

Number of deaths in Shanghai where G3 is? Still only one so far and an increasing number of recovered patients in Shanghai. This is one is really important. If there's a sudden spike in cases in Shanghai, that will be an issue. If you zoom into the map, Shanghai has 299 confirmed cases so far which is the lowest or one of the lowest in the entire region of all major centers. Hubei, the epicenter, is about 1000 km from Shanghai and is heavily quarantined so transmission shouldn't be a concern at this point. Out of the two closest cities, Zhejiang has more cases at around 1000 and is 300-400 km from Shanghai but from my understanding is also quarantined so transmission to Shanghai is not likely at this point. I expect there will be a few more deaths unfortunately in Shanghai as time goes on but also a slowed increased rate of confirmed cases and a trend upwards with recovered cases which are all reassuring.

As long as these numbers are fairly accurate it's looking good so far as long as there is no further focus of infectivity somewhere in China or elsewhere. There's a good chance cases are under reported due to milder cases and/or poor or lagging recording/testing/diagnostic methods but overall things should be ok based on what I have been seeing. It's also hard to mistrust international data as we can be more sure of the numbers the US, Canada, etc. are reporting and those numbers have all been reassuring so far. I believe China is being very aggressive in shutting things down and quarantining high risk areas more so because of the infectivity of the virus rather than the lethality of it. Things can change of course but looking at these numbers so far has been reassuring.

Having said all that, the market is an emotional place and it's totally reasonable to suspect the Western world will react negatively to news coming from China out of distrust, fear or other reasons. I thinking sitting tight until we're past this is a good idea and perhaps looking to add shares and/or calls if an opportunity pops up due to the virus sentiment and/or Q1. As for the virus itself, I'm not worried unless further evidence shared by WHO, Canadian, American and European health agencies gives reason to."

Same as i'm sure when cars took over folks had good reason to feel for all the horse trade related folks newly out of work.

But , bezos beat the shit out of everyone in ecom...I dont want to say ""fair and square"" but, he literally built ""the"" marketplace. Walmart is actively competing by using all the stores and logistics they have to play him on his own game and third party sellers are welcome to put up shop with them as well.

My understanding (hearing from ecom folks who are semi retired, having build and sold million dollar businesses) is that you primarily use amazon to launch a product, you should really be building a brand so that if the product itself is knocked off (which amazon and other amazon sellers will do) you're only losing 5 or 10% of your business because people want the real deal.

This author also clearly hasn't done any of his own importing, major suppliers began building alternative supply chains to china as early as 2006 , well before a trump trade war or coronavirus fears. China itself manufacturers a lot of things in other SE asian countries because the rising cost of labor within its own borders has made this sensible (vietnams the hot spot right now and doesn't yet have china level infastructure but its coming) . I'm also going to call him out for associating geopolitics and economics at all , stick to the subject (for all we know chinas one black swan event away from collpasing like the soviet union) . 

Then he goes on to blame the fall of toys r us on amazon, really? we're going to ignore the well known bain capital buyout? or any of the other myriad reasons which other bloggers have done to death? just gonna cherry pick huh? ok then...

""There are many accounts of entrepreneurs who have launched a successful product only to have it copied and sold at a lower quality and price."" , yes, which also happens on shopify and kickstarter, because the items on the internet and we have global commerce. Amazons letting it happen and profiting from it but they didn't arrange this on purpose. As I pointed out above real entrepreneurs avoid having much of a presence on amazon except to introduce the product to the world and beta test. You build a solid brand and people will buy the real deal, how many of you reading this drink knock off coca cola? , they mention a wool shoe company who refused to even get on amazon. Well then clearly the people searching for those shoes on amazon weren't their customer base to begin with were they? so the consumer gets the same quality shoe without the eco friendly edge, if they want to pay for the eco friendly shoes they can open a new tab and do so. No ones commited a crime.

>Canada Responds to the Coronavirus Epidemic

>On Jan. 30, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus to constitute a public health emergency of international concern. The virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has already caused more than 43,000 people to become sick and resulted in more than 1,000 deaths.

>Besides Canada, 27 countries have reported cases of novel coronavirus. The Canadian government notes that seven cases have been detected in Canada, with three of those cases detected in the province of Ontario and four in the province of British Columbia. The Public Health Agency of Canada has assessed “the public health risk associated with 2019-nCov as low for Canada.”

And

>Vincent Rigby assumed the role of national security adviser to the prime minister. Rigby previously worked in a number of different governmental agencies and most recently served as associate deputy minister of foreign affairs. Rigby is the third person “to advise Trudeau on national security since … May 2018.”"

The grab an ""envelope"", their outer surface that protects their nucleic acid, from a bit of [the host cell's membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane).  It doesn't take much to wreck that setup.  Compare to viruses like the notorious norovirus that have an outer shell make of proteins.

I say this mostly to encourage not freaking out over things like how long a laboratory can manage to keep a coronavirus alive on a cold, non-porous surface under ideal conditions, this is one of the few areas in the basic biology of COVID-19 that's in our favor."

Face masks and hand sanitizer are impossible to buy; everywhere is sold out.

I ain't trying to convert you to the church of the flying spaghetti monster. If you want to learn a bit more about the situation, then the link I posted is a decent, bipartisan, discussion on it. I've read this entire thread and no one has advised you to quit your job and build a panic room.

Just something to consider... (you won't, but you do you)
1) Our airport sees more daily travelers than anywhere else in the world.
2) Six states have reported at least one case of coronavirus.
3) A study released yesterday by a multinational group of pathologists, microbiologists, and statisticians reported a transmission rate of 3.77 people per carrier. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021675v1
3) Asymptomatic transmission is suspected. 

Just take deep breaths and maybe have a wank. Hopefully that post-nut-clarity will revive your ability to think critically.

And just to reiterate. No one is saying this is the end of the world... If they are claiming that, they are wrong. It's just a good idea to be prepared for a public health emergency. You wouldn't laugh at someone buying extra water after learning about a possible storm during hurricane season would you? While pandemics are not as common as hurricanes, it's only been century since the last one."

**2.12.2020 Update:**

**2019-nCOV: (*****Considerably)*** **Worse than the 1918 Spanish Flu.**

**With the recent manuscript out of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, indicating that this virus is more contagious than the 1918 Spanish Flu, it’s worth sounding a RED ALERT to online communities in an attempt to raise awareness.**  **I can only hope that my post today helps to inform and raise awareness to the dire situation globalized civilization faces, and to help one prepare for the upcoming collapse of Industrialized civilization.**

Known Facts:

1**. R0 of 2.6-6.6.** This is *considerably more* contagious than the 1918 Spanish flu. Reputable Source (although not yet peer-reviewed) *Los Alamos National Laboratory.* 

2. 2-14 day contagious asymptomatic period *plus* another 1-2 weeks of infection and post infection spreading.  1 month of infectious period is *considerably worse* than the 1918 Spanish Flu.

3. Whistleblowers indicate a hospitalization rate of 20-25%. Without hospitalization, most of that 20-25% = death. Minimum fatality rate of 2%, with some estimates of 5% *with* hospitalization. This is *on par* with the 1918 Spanish Flu.

4. Cytokine Storm, bloody pneumonia, high rates of death even in young and healthy individuals- multiple organ failure. Without hospitalization = high chance of death, from all ages (see dead children video below).

5. No cure, just hope you have oxygen and IV fluids.

6. Virus confirmed to live on surfaces for up to several days

7. Virus spread from droplets, vomit, feces, and bodily fluids - cannot touch the dead, cremation or mass burials is the only option.

8. China's quarantine of 100+ million people, and the shutdown of its economy is unprecedented and has never happened before.  With n R0 of 6.6, we now understand *why* China went to these lengths.

9. Thousands of flights continue to come and go - flights haven't stopped. Hundreds of cruise ships continue unabated on a global scale.

**What to Expect?** We still do not have any confirmation of facts indicating exactly how susceptible different ethnicities are to nCOV. It’s worth noting that numerous British individuals have contracted the virus, indicating that Caucasians are certainly not terribly immune to nCOV. Therefore, with an average R0 between 3 and 6 (roughly speaking), 30 day period of individuals capable of spreading the infection, a 25% critical illness rate, we can expect a *considerably* worse situation than the 1918 Spanish Flu.  ***Unfortunately, these facts clearly point towards a virus capable of collapsing industrialized civilization.***

I'm not trying to say you talk about it.  All I'm saying is that race and racism come up fairly often.  Shit, right now, we're talking about race.  

I just finished listening to a news broadcast asking what people thought about claims that trump's restricted travel list is racially motivated, followed by a story about how the coronavirus is stoking stereotypes about the chinese internationally, I saw about 10 ""BLM"" signs in yards on the way to my house and that was all within the last two hours.  

So, that's fine that you don't ever talk about it.  Not my point.  My point is that it gets talked about a lot.  Pretty often. That's it.

Methodology:Original extrapolation is a 2-factor polynomial best fit from Feb 1, 2020 (green line and dots). Each day I am plotting a new 2-factor polynomial best fit (blue line) from the actual data (blue dots). By comparing the blue and green lines, we can get a sense of how the rate of growth is growing (or shrinking) by comparison.

Original best fit polynomial equation: 0.5869x2+5.53664x - 10.162, where x is days since January 20 (start of data)

It came on pretty quickly (I felt fine in the morning and ended up leaving work early because I wasn't feeling well) and I ended up working from home for a few days until I no longer had a fever and the coughing became manageable. 

I do still have a *slight* cough (pretty easily controlled with drops, mind you) but what's more noticeable is the remaining heaviness in my chest. I wash and sanitize my hands and desk frequently; I wouldn't be at the office if I couldn't *stop* coughing... It's mostly a problem when I step outside into the cold air. But I'm not sure I'm entirely clear of whatever I had. For what it's worth (not much), I get colds and sinus infections pretty regularly, but I don't often get a dry cough.

I did not go to the doctor, as I didn't really see the point, and I even joked with my colleagues (via email, from my home office) about having ""A coronavirus, but not THE coronavirus"" at the time.

I commute daily via bus. My bus routes are heavily utilized by students of a local University, college, and international boarding school. I live in a moderately large Canadian city.

Grain of salt and whatnot."

17 days ago, I (M20) and my fellow moderators (F/M12) on /r/bonehurtingjuice decided to lock the subreddit to ""spread awareness of the looming Coronavirus threat"", a disease overwhelmingly affecting poorer countries in the world. Despite our best efforts, as time has shown, the coronavirus disease has not been vanquished.

Our obviously laudable and morally good attempt at trying to stop the spread of the virus was unfotunately not well received by packs of angry redditors. They proceeded to attack me with a most ferocious attitude over the next two weeks. When I attempted to defend our actions in a sincere post calling for respect and understanding between moderators and /r/bonehurtingjuice subscribers, I was met with more feral hatred and rage. As I attempted to defend myself and my fellow moderators from these vicious charges, I may have slipped down the moral high ground every now and again. At their core, however, our actions were pure. We did not deserve the rabid onslaught and the many calls to violence and DMs telling us to kill ourselves we received.

So, reddit, AITA?

**While Coronavirus Cruise Passengers Are Offered Free Porn, Russian Woman Escapes Quarantine ‘Cages’**



The adult website, CamSoda, offered free porn to the 7,300 passengers who have been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak on the Diamond Princess and World Dream cruise ships, which are docked in Japan and outside Hong Kong.


Meanwhile, Russia’s coronavirus patients have been locked up in cages, according to this Russian quarantine ‘cages’ escapee.


The 32-year old woman, Alla Ilyina, had been quarantined in St. Petersburg’s Botkinskaya clinic since she went for a check-up after visiting China’s Hainan seaside resort with a sore throat. 


She tested negative for the coronavirus three times, and decided to take matters into her own hands when doctors insisted she had to stay. 


> ""I drew up a map before and made a detailed plan. When evening came and the medical staff had let their guard down, I short-circuited the magnetic lock in my containment room and opened the door. I studied physics, which helped,” Ilyina explained.


> ""Our constitution guarantees freedom. I didn’t understand why I had to stay in a hospital cage,” she added.

Image Caption: *Alla Ilyina drew a map of her escape from the Botskinskaya clinic. allasand / Instagram*


In response to the incident, the president of the Axiom association of lawyer, Svetlana Savinova, said: 

> ""If there are no symptoms anymore, if the tests all come back negative, then doctors don’t’ have a legal right to keep a patient in quarantine, it is considered involuntary detention and abuse of office.”


Savinova also referred to Article 236 of Russia’s Criminal Code, which says that while Russians will be held accountable for violations of sanitary-epidemiological rules, they can only be charged if a transgression leads to mass disease, poisoning or death. 


In St. Petersburg, not a single case of the coronavirus has yet been identified. 


On the other hand, doctors in favor of the stern quarantine policies argue that these strict rules are exactly what is keeping the number of Russians infected at zero. 

> ""Her escape is shocking. This is a poorly thought out impulsive act that could have grave consequences,” infectious disease specialist, Vladislav Zhemchugov, said in a statement.

Ilyina wasn’t the first patient to have [escaped](https://time.com/5782790/3-people-escape-coronavirus-quarantine-russia/) quarantine in Russia.


Last week, local media reported that a 34-year-old mother fled a hospital with her son in the southern city of Samara."

 “Acho que hoje é cedo demais para tentar prever o fim dessa epidemia”, disse Michael Ryan, chefe do departamento de emergência da OMS em Genebra.

 O diretor da OMS, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, afirmou que o número de novos casos relatados na China se estabilizou durante a última semana, mas o dado deve ser interpretado com extrema cautela. “Essa epidemia pode ir em qualquer direção”, alertou.

  

 A OMS realizou uma conferência na terça (11) e na quarta-feira (12) que reuniu centenas de especialistas em epidemiologia de todo o mundo, inclusive do Brasil, para revisar os meios de combater a doença, agora chamada de covid-19.

 Entre as prioridades discutidas estão acelerar pesquisas para o desenvolvimento de remédios e vacinas capazes de conter o coronavírus e garantir o acesso a dados e novas tecnologias aos países mais necessitados.

  Essas foram algumas das prioridades que saíram de reunião da OMS (Organização Mundial da Saúde) em Genebra, com especialistas em saúde de todo mundo, inclusive do Brasil, e que terminou nesta quarta (12).

 Durante dois dias, foram discutidos o nível atual de conhecimento sobre a nova doença (covid-19), identificadas lacunas e as pesquisas necessárias para ajudar a interromper a atual epidemia e preparar-se para as futuras.

 “Esse surto é um teste de solidariedade política, financeira e científica. Precisamos nos unir para combater um inimigo comum que não respeita fronteiras, garantir que tenhamos os recursos necessários para encerrar esse surto e trazer nossa melhor ciência para encontrar respostas compartilhadas para problemas comuns”, disse Tedros Ghebreyesus.

 Para Yazdan Yazdanpanah, presidente da Colaboração em Pesquisa Global para a Preparação de Doenças Infecciosas, parceira da OMS, o acesso equitativo será fundamental. “Precisamos garantir que o compartilhamento de dados cheguem aos mais necessitados, em particular nos países de baixa e média renda.”

 Há uma série de perguntas ainda sem respostas que foram discutidas na reunião, entre elas quais os melhores testes diagnóstico e manejo quando o paciente está doente, drogas e vacinas para se tratar, medidas eficazes para evitar transmissão, melhores equipamentos de proteção e quais restrições de movimento têm realmente impacto.

 “Também se discutiu por que as pessoas não estão aderindo às normas da OMS, por que elas estão exagerando,[ fazendo coisas loucas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/desconhecimento-falta-de-controle-e-xenofobia-alimentam-temor-de-coronavirus.shtml)”, disse à **Folha **a infectologista Anna Sara Levin, diretora da divisão de moléstias infecciosas do Hospital das Clínicas de São Paulo que participou da reunião.

 Durante a reunião, foram analisadas as possibilidades de [vacina](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/cientistas-australianos-criam-coronavirus-em-laboratorio-para-acelerar-vacinas.shtml) e vantagens que se tem entre um ou outro tratamento (por exemplo, oxigênio em alto fluxo ou ventilação mecânica?). “Está todo mundo ainda inventando na beira do leito. Precisamos de pesquisas para mostrar quais são as melhores práticas”, disse Anna.

 Segundo ela, outra deliberação do encontro será reunir todas as drogas que podem ter minimamente efeito na infecção do coronavírus (as que já existem e as que serão desenvolvidas a partir de agora) e testá-las em modelos animais. 

 “Nem isso está claro. Qual modelo animal podemos trabalhar para saber se as drogas funcionam? Ainda não sabemos. Precisamos de um animal que adoeça, que sirva de modelo e que, preferencialmente, seja fácil de ser manipulado.”

 As discussões do encontro formarão a base de um roteiro de pesquisa e inovação, mapeando todos estudos necessários e prioritários para uma resposta adequada à epidemia de coronavírus."

And there was that requisite CDC “What is Coronavirus” leaflet hanging on the cork board outside the OR where we also post babysitter numbers and condos for rent. 

I am certain things will get ramped up this week though. About a month into Ebola this level 1 hospital put a tarp/tent situation up outside the ED where any new out of country peeps coming in had to check in at that tent if they had any symptoms similar to Ebola. It came down a week later I think.

The Nazi’s were funded by the Jesuits. The Jesuits manipulate the Catholic Church. Islam should not be confused with the Muslim Brotherhood. These are three globalist organizations that have encroached their way into most of the nations (and banking systems) on earth. They are NOT to be confused with the actual religions.

Each of these three organizations believe Jerusalem to be the location of “God” (or quite possibly for an unknown ulterior motive), and quite possibly plan to claim Jerusalem as the capital of their globalist entity.

Boycotting Israel fairs well for the Muslim Brotherhood. Supporting the Israeli people fairs well for the Zionist Occupational Government and/or the Jesuits, whichever ends up completing the overthrow of our government (which has been plotted since its inception). The Jesuits were forcibly removed from every European nation by the year 1773. The United States of America was founded by Protestants opposing the Catholic Church in 1776. Do some research into the history of America (the history of recorded humanity, for that matter), and the history of these organizations. Use rational logic to connect the dots. The people in power want the mass populations to think it’s simply a matter of racial injustice. It’s way deeper than that.

Every time one of these organizations tries to overthrow or destabilize a nation, they’ve either smuggled immigrants or drugs into it. Look into the history of Catholic immigration in this country. Immigration bans often have nothing to do with skin color. And this is a fact that the mass population often gets twisted. When the British Empire wanted to overthrow the Chinese government, they smuggled millions of pounds of opium from Afghanistan into China to destabilize the nation. How do you think this theory relates to drug smuggling in America? Who is trying to destabilize and overthrow whom? It has nothing to do with nationality at this point, since the globe is divided into 4 major organizations.

Addendum: the fourth appears to be the Chinese government, which has persistently attempted to remain sovereign throughout history. Look where that’s gotten them. The Zionist Occupational Government contaminated the country and destabilized its entire economy.  Research who patented the coronavirus, who preaches mandatory vaccinations, and who demands mandatory healthcare for all. Use logic.

The World Health Organization created the virus, the Bill and Melinda Gates Organization helped fund the project and plans to mandate vaccinations, Bernie Sanders is for universal healthcare. The Zionist Occupational Government effectively destabilized an entire country in a matter of weeks. Imagine what they’re already doing to America.

Just my perspective."

The  incubation period for this disease has been said to be up to 24-42  days.  That is quite a long time, since the outbreak became  overwhelmingly serious as of January 23, 2020, one would have to wait  and see what will unfold in the next couple of weeks to rule out the  deaths that will result outside of China.

I was told they're missing parts, had a shipment sent to the wrong country apparently. But they've been experiencing delays for months... So not sure how something that started weeks ago, causes delays before it's happened.

They've apparently pushed my order to their ""priority list"" which according to the pictures he posted on Discord is around 60 orders.. which makes less sense because they're made in batches of 20.. so he should only be 3 batches behind. But it doesn't like he's more like 10.

Told me ""they have mouths to feed"" so they can't just shut down taking orders.. but they can't fulfill them so I'm not really sure how that makes sense..."

The previous record rise in the toll was 103 on Feb. 10.

The grim new tally came a day after China had reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in two weeks, bolstering a forecast by Beijing’s senior medical adviser for the outbreak there to end by April.

But the 2,015 new confirmed cases reported in mainland China on Wednesday was dwarfed by the 14,840 new cases reported in Hubei alone on Thursday, when provincial officials said they had adopted a new methodology for counting infections.

It was not immediately clear how the new methodology affected the results, nor why the death toll rose so sharply.

Results from Chinese trials testing a combination of antiviral drugs used to treat HIV against the new coronavirus are due in weeks, but experts say a vaccine could still be months away.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned any apparent slowdown in the spread of the epidemic should be viewed with “extreme caution”.

“This outbreak could still go in any direction,” he told a briefing in Geneva.
Another expert said that while the coronavirus may be peaking in China, this was not the case elsewhere.

“It has spread to other places where it’s the beginning of the outbreak,” Dale Fisher, head of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the WHO, said in an interview in Singapore. “In Singapore, we are at the beginning.”

Singapore has 50 cases, including one found at its biggest bank, DBS (DBSM.SI), on Wednesday that caused an evacuation at the head office.

Hundreds of infections have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and territories, but only two people have died from the virus outside mainland China - one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.

Tedros said a WHO-led advance team that traveled to China this week had made good progress on the composition and scope of its work.
The head of the WHO’s emergency program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said it was too early “to predict the beginning, the middle or end of the epidemic”."

I've been there for while, but not much in the last two weeks. What I observed from before that things were mostly well-run; they do have a rule against political discussions, but it exempts criticism of government for their handling of the virus cases. I've seen plenty of people/posts criticizing the CCP; didn't see them dissapear or get banned. If the comments were just ""CCP bad"" repeatedly, then obviously it's a different story.

>They've apparently been banning people with anything bad to say about the CCP, how they've handled things, and anyone who's asking for fact checks (someone fact check that last point please).

I've been out of the loop about these things; could you provide/link to some evidence of this? Or a link to this new subreddit dedicated for ppl banned? I actually left b/c most of subs turned to conspiracy land, with doomsday theorists or others making outlandish claims (""The virus is gonna to kill us all"", ""Civilization will collapse"", etc.). Gone over to r/medicine for now, which allows less discussion from non-medical ppl (not that it isn't allowed at all, it is) and plenty of bad things about the CCP have been said freely over there as well.

*(The only thing that I disagreed with in regards to moderations is that there is this one mod, who is apparently working in US public health and involved in research/planning for coronavirus and prep, going a bit heavy handed in locking comments/threads that he deemed ""racism"".

>Lenny Bernstein  7-9 minutes       
>  
>The  coronavirus has killed more than 1,100 people, brought a huge swath of  central China to a standstill and rattled millions around the globe with  hints of a pandemic seen in Hollywood fantasies.  
>  
>But the virus’s  destructive potential has overshadowed one encouraging aspect of this  outbreak: So far, about 82 percent of the cases — including all 13 in  the United States — have been mild, with symptoms that require little or  no medical intervention. And that proportion may be an undercount.  
>  
>Health authorities managing the outbreak [are trying to understand what that critical fact portends.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/07/biggest-questions-about-new-coronavirus-what-we-know-so-far/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3)  Are the 45,000 sick people tallied so far just a portion of a vast  reservoir of uncounted victims, some of whom may be spreading the  disease? And do the mild illnesses reveal characteristics of the virus  itself — something that could be useful in crafting a more effective  response?  
>  
>“The fact that there are so many mild cases is a real  hallmark of this disease and makes it so different from SARS,” said  Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School  of Public Health’s Center for Health Security. “It’s also really  challenging. Most of our surveillance is oriented around finding people  who require medical intervention.”  
>  
>For those who study viruses,  the large number of mild cases is reason for optimism. “This looks to be  a bad, heightened cold — I think that’s a rational way of thinking  about it,” said Matthew Frieman, a virologist at the University of  Maryland School of Medicine. “Not to diminish its importance — it’s in  the middle between SARS and the common cold.”  
>  
>Though the virus was identified just six weeks ago, [some of its characteristics are becoming clear.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-spread-containment-strategy/2020/01/28/84c25030-4200-11ea-aa6a-083d01b3ed18_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_8&itid=lk_inline_manual_8)  For the elderly and those with underlying heart disease, diabetes or  other conditions, the disease can be quite severe. They are the ones  dominating the ranks of the dead, often after pneumonia or other  respiratory problems that lead to organ failure.  
>  
>Others are not  suffering nearly as much. Healthy, younger adults seem to do better, and  there have been few fatalities among children, for reasons that have  caused much speculation among experts.  
>  
>“It could be that some  people have an immune response that results in severe illness and some  people don’t,” Nuzzo said. “It is common … in coronaviruses that there  is a spectrum of illness.”  
>  
>At a presentation on the disease hosted  Tuesday by the Aspen Institute in Washington, Nancy Messonnier, an  official with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted  that only a few of the 13 U.S. patients required oxygen during  convalescence.  
>  
>“All the patients in the U.S. haven’t required tons  of excessive care and actually, right now, they’re actually all  improving,” said Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for  Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Based on the U.S. experience,  and based on the experience of other countries outside China, a lot of  these patients seem to be doing okay.”  
>  
>But Messonnier and others  are less confident about what that might signify. She noted that U.S.  officials set a very low threshold for illness as they  began their   search for people with the disease among returnees from central China.  
>  
>“If we hadn’t been looking so hard,” she suggested, “we might not have found them.”  
>  
>Another  possibility, said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine  and health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, is that the  U.S. patients were a self-selected sample of fairly healthy people —  hardy enough, at least, to travel to Wuhan and back. Eleven of the U.S.  patients were such travelers, while two others were spouses who came in  contact with them after they returned.  
>  
>Schaffner also noted that  in China, where the vast majority of deaths and illnesses from the  “covid-19” disease have occurred, air pollution and a higher smoking  prevalence may contribute to the severity of the disease.  
>  
>Many  experts have said early phases of outbreaks like this one tend to have a  large number of severe cases, as the sickest people flock to hospitals  and come to doctors’ attention. And in Wuhan, where the health-care  system is overwhelmed, people have complained they cannot find a  hospital to test them for the virus, let alone to treat their symptoms.  So patients with milder versions may be at home, uncounted, waiting out  the epidemic.  
>  
>In its latest [“situation report,”](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/)  released Wednesday, the World Health Organization listed 45,171  confirmed cases in 25 countries including China, with just 441 of the  cases outside China. The WHO classified 8,204 of the Chinese cases as  severe, meaning virtually all the rest are mild.  
>  
>The WHO does not  break down the cases outside China, but some countries do. Singapore,  for example, has reported that 15 of its 50 patients have fully  recovered and been discharged. Most of the others still hospitalized are  “stable or improving,” while eight are in critical condition in  intensive care.  
>  
>Currently, the death rate of the disease is  hovering around 2.5 percent, a remarkably high level, about the rate of  the 1918 flu pandemic that killed roughly 50 million people around the  world. Normal seasonal flu kills less than one-tenth of one percent of  people who contract the virus.  
>  
>But experts have said the  coronavirus fatality rate is likely to decline substantially as they  compile a more accurate count of the people who contract the virus and  survive. At the Aspen Institute presentation, Anthony S. Fauci, director  of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he  hoped the rate could decline toward 1 percent.  
>  
>Either figure makes  the virus much less deadly than severe acute respiratory syndrome  (SARS), which killed more than 9 percent of the people who contracted it  in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which kills  nearly 35 percent of its victims.  
>  
>The mild nature of many  illnesses, some experts said, may stem from the properties of the  pathogen itself. For reasons scientists still don’t fully understand,  one virus may be a nuisance and a very similar one can be deadly. While  two different coronaviruses produced SARS and MERS, four others cause  about 30 percent of all common colds.  
>  
>The severity of the resulting illness is “inherent in the virus,” said Frieman, the University of Maryland virologist.  
>  
>One  of the coronaviruses that causes cold symptoms, called NL63, uses the  same doorway into cells and infects the same cells as SARS, he said.  
>  
>“One gives you a runny nose and the other gives you lethal pneumonia,” Frieman said. “No one studies this.”  
>  
>A  major question to be answered is who is most at risk. While many are  focused on the overall death rate from the virus, Peter Hotez, dean of  the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine,  said it is important to focus on the fatality rate in vulnerable groups.  
>  
>“SARS  was 10 percent overall, but it was 50 percent among older people,”  Hotez said. Figuring out who is most at risk is essential for creating  the right public health strategy.  
>  
>“If you really want to address this epidemic, it’s especially important we protect the vulnerable groups,” Hotez said."

# San Diego lab discovers COVID-19 vaccine in 3 hours

Inovio Pharmaceuticals created a vaccine that is going through pre-clinical trials. 

SAN DIEGO — In a race against the clock, a San Diego lab is scrambling to get a COVID-19 vaccine out and on the market. As the days go by, Inovio Pharmaceuticals is getting closer to releasing the desperately needed vaccine against the deadly virus. 

Inovio Pharmaceuticals, which is located in Sorrento Valley, has also created a vaccine for the Zika virus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the vaccine for Ebola. 

&#x200B;

Dr. Trevor Smith, who is the director of research and development at Inovio, said, ""It's something we are trained to do, and the infrastructure is here and the expertise is in house.""

When Chinese scientists released the genetic sequence on Jan. 9, Inovio researchers got to work immediately and within 3 hours they had a vaccine for coronavirus, or COVID-19 as it is now being referred to. 

""We have an algorithm which we designed, and we put the DNA sequence into our algorithm and came up with the vaccine in that short amount of time,"" said Dr. Smith. 

Tens of thousands in China have been quarantined and continue to suffer from the virus. That’s why scientists at Inovio Pharmaceuticals say they feel the sense of urgency to get the vaccine out.  

The vaccine has been tested on mice and guinea pigs. It will next be tried on a group of human patients. 

Scientists hope the vaccine will work like a piece of biological software. In other words, the vaccine will give the human body instructions to create the proper attack in the form of T-cells and antibodies against COVID-19. 

If all goes as planned, the vaccine could be made available to the public by early this summer - which would be a record time frame for Inovio Pharmaceuticals. 

Currently, an Inovio Pharmaceuticals lead researcher is in Sweden meeting with the World Health Organization to come up with the best plan of attack against COVID-19. "

It just spreads quick as all fuck. It’s not gonna threaten humanity though. The media is a business and they make more money if they get people freaked out because they get more views. So they want you to freak out over it a bit. 

What’s funny is these same bastards don’t try to freak you out on climate change which is extremely real, because the huge companies that own the media make more money if you deny it’s existence and don’t hold them accountable for raping the Earth. 

The majority media is just a branch of the cooperations to make/save them money.Never forget that."

Scientists hope the vaccine will work like a piece of biological software. In other words, the vaccine will give the human body instructions to create the proper attack in the form of T-cells and antibodies against COVID-19. 

If all goes as planned, the vaccine could be made available to the public by early this summer - which would be a record time frame for Inovio Pharmaceuticals. 

Currently, an Inovio Pharmaceuticals lead researcher is in Sweden meeting with the World Health Organization to come up with the best plan of attack against COVID-19."

I wouldn't say it like that. There are a lot of viruses that can cause the common cold, with a coronavirus being one of them. I think the rhinovirus is the most common cause of a cold, followed by coronaviruses.

> 
>  
> 
>  Con apenas 24 años, egresado de Economía de la Universidad de San Andrés, Franco y tres investigadores del Conicet –C**arla Giménez, Federico Pereyra Bonnet** y **Lucía Curti**–, idearon un kit de detección molecular portátil, que en apenas 60 minutos puede decir si una persona está infectada con el virus que hoy tiene en vilo al mundo, **ya mató a más de mil personas y afectó a 43 mil.**
> 
>  
> 
>  El joven porteño se encuentra en Manhattan porque está en pleno _road show_: **el proyecto Caspr Biotech –que llevan adelante los cuatro y patentaron en los Estados Unidos– aspira a conseguir inversiones por tres millones de dólares para que el dispositivo, que ya se probó con éxito en pruebas piloto en Misiones y en Brasil para detectar el dengue, se haga masivo.**

> 
>  
> 
>  Goytia –que por pedido de IndieBio se tuvo que mudar a San Francisco– comenta que “esto ha despertado el interés de organismos de salud de distintos países del mundo, así como de distintas instituciones a nivel mundial. Desde el CDC (Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades en los Estados Unidos) hasta la fundación de Bill Gates que ha hecho un anuncio de destinar 100 millones de dólares para colaborar en la contención de la epidemia”. A pesar de ese interés creciente, **por el momento el gobierno chino no se contactó con ellos.**
> 
>  
> 
>  Según Franco, el gran problema que existe hoy con el coronavirus –y en rigor con todas las enfermedades infecciosas– es que la detección se realiza con un método conocido como PCR. “Depende de laboratorios centralizados, personal capacitado, reactivos costosos e importados. Cuesta decena de miles de dólares y, en el mejor de los casos, hay un lapso de tres o cuatro días desde que se toman las muestras hasta los resultados. El coronavirus puede transmitirse de persona a persona por vía aérea, a través de un estornudo y otros tipos de contacto. Esto implica que su propagación puede alcanzar grandes magnitudes"".

>  “En la actual epidemia, el método de _screening_ o de detección se hace a través, digamos, de un termómetro de temperatura avanzado, pero que es básicamente eso. En pocos segundos lee la temperatura, pero a nivel de control de la epidemia tienen grandes falencias. El hecho de que las formas de detección estén basadas en los síntomas omite el período de ventana de la enfermedad, que puede ser de dos semanas o más, en las que la persona puede contagiar pero los síntomas como la temperatura corporal no lo expresan”, explica.
> 
>  
> 
>  “Aquellas personas con síntomas positivos deben ser aislados en hospitales especializados hasta contar con la confirmación del laboratorio molecular. Esto implica una demora de varios días que, sumada al alto costo que implica, hacen que estos análisis no sean realizados de rutina para todas las personas. En muchos casos el paciente podría no tener coronavirus, pero se lo mantuvo aislado por días en la incertidumbre de si es que verdaderamente era o no portador del virus”, añade.
> 
>  
> 
>  El valor de cada kit que están en condiciones de producir, según Goytía, **“es más o menos de dos dólares. Es súper accesible.** Para que te des una idea, en la Argentina trabajamos con un laboratorio en Misiones para la detección del dengue. Cuando conocieron la simplicidad y el costo del sistema, se emocionaron. Muchos reactivos de laboratorio, que son importados, no estaban llegando, y cada test les podía costar 15 dólares”. Cabe mencionar que **el gobierno chino ya ha destinado alrededor de 5.500 millones de dólares para intentar detener la epidemia.**

Contar con un método portátil para la detección molecular puede ser la diferencia entre controlar el virus o que se siga expandiendo a pesar de los esfuerzos de los gobiernos y los grandes centros de salud.

Nosotros buscamos cuál es la secuencia del coronavirus y, a partir de eso, en una semana, lo sintetizamos y produjimos el test validado para esta enfermedad. A la tirita se le pone una muestra que, dependiendo de cada _target_, puede ser un hisopado nasal, orina o sangre. **En este caso, lo aconsejable, por la concentración del virus, es un hisopado. En menos de 30 minutos la tirita muestra si da positivo, con una rayita negra, o negativo si no marca nada.**

People in China are happy with the CCP leadership because they recognise the increase in living conditions and prosperity that they have enjoyed.

The political repression and censorship helps stop nascent anti-government movements, but the real thing keeping the CCP firmly in power is that people feel life is getting better.

If the Coronavirus is controlled and ceases to be a concern in a month or two then the CCP will be fine, and will be able to push propaganda about how their actions prevented the epidemic from being worse. If a million people die (in China) and this drags on for any significant period of time, then the Chinese populace may well begin to question the efficacy of the CCP's rule - especially when people are losing jobs/their businesses as the economic effects of the illness hit, or if more stories come out about the CCP covering up the initial cases.

I don't think for a minute that Coronavirus will spell the end for the CCP, but Xi's power is not limitless by any means - and it isn't predicated on the support of the public in perhaps the same way as a democratic leader. It took a lot of backroom dealing for him to get where he is today, and those same CCP higher-ups will have zero hesitation in using Xi (or some of his key lieutenants) as scapegoats in order to preserve the party's hold on power.

That may not fundamentally change the geopolitical situation, but a change in leader or change in senior figures around the leader will certainly change China's aims, actions, and future path, even if relatively subtly. Therefore the outbreak, and how effectively China can contain it, are of immense importance to the CCP."

Please remember, people are recovering from this! The cases outside of China prove there are likely many mild cases and they have been described either as feeling like a cold or a flu. Epidemiologists now believe the number of mild cases in Hubei is quite substantial which is both good and bad. Bad being that so many have it but good because it means the case fatality rate will likely start to fall from what it is now.

The situation in Wuhan is terrible but the most severe cases are the ones that are on the radar, all the mild cases are kind of just in limbo and many will likely never get confirmed. The people dying right now are mostly elderly people and people with health conditions, there are also some indications pollution and smoking are having a detrimental effect on the cases in China. Yes there are some young people dying, but deaths among young people are quite rare. 

Is China conducting cover ups? Absolutely, but you have to remember China has an authoritarian government who fear losing control of the 1.4 billion in their country and a public health crisis is very bad for their image.

As for the death to recovery ratio, China is taking no chances and is keeping people who have recovered quarantined so the recovery number is lagging at the moment.

There are A LOT of similarities between the response from this virus and the swine flu back in 2009 - we overestimated the fatality rate for swine flu in the beginning too because we were only using data from severe cases. With swine flu, there were also reports of cytokine storms and the virus hit the elderly and people with health conditions hard as well.

We've been here before and we'll be here again, but we're getting better at it.

In the meantime, I also suggest you stay off any coronavirus related subreddits, stay away from coronavirus twitter, and anywhere else where people are trying to frame speculation as fact. I only following information from the CDC and a few other epidemiologists at this point.

Bottom line, yes, we should keep an eye on this virus but at this moment, influenza in the US is a big issue so don't focus on one virus while completely forgetting about the one that is already here. We're going to be OK."

What makes this anywhere near equivalent? That's the same sort of dangerous comparisons that you get when people compare Trump to Hitler or Coronavirus to the black plague. That's called ""Because A then B"" and it's a HUGE logical fallacy.

You're hopefully not doing this on purpose but that sort of argument is not only harmful to great posts like these but also harmful to you because people will not desire to debate with you when the debate is filled with fallacy.

>i mean look at the middle east they are still buying slaves.

Why are you singling out the middle east? Slavery is an issue across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  This has serious racist undertones and I would like you to strongly consider not singling out cultures when it's a broad and encompassing issue.

>also stop your political stomping for some party you perceive to better than the other

You are clearly a Christian given that you say -

>and as Christians who value the lives of children we say no.

\- yet here you are breaking one of the two great commandments - the commandments that JESUS CHRIST says encompass ALL law and ALL prophets.  Jesus says to love all people as much as yourself - your enemies and friends alike.  What sort of love are you demonstrating in this message? Sure, biblical love has a lot to do with encouraging righteous behavior, but what you're doing lacks that righteousness that's so important.  The OP is definitely giving sincere righteous love in their message and is encouraging programs that are both compassionate and could possibly help MANY people.

You are making a comment that lacks love and this is evident by the way you choose to approach what you disagree with.  If you want to be more Christ like, you need to grow constantly as a Christian and for you I think that starts with explaining things with far more care and a genuine desire to help people, don't point fingers of blame unless it is with genuine compassion and genuine selflessness and in a way that demonstrates genuine desire to do good for others."

2020-02-12,williambotter,brasilnoticias,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/brasilnoticias/comments/f2nwkj/quase_metade_dos_sobreviventes_do_último/fhdoxsa/," Entre 2002 e 2003, um [coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/desconhecimento-falta-de-controle-e-xenofobia-alimentam-temor-de-coronavirus.shtml) [provocou pânico no mundo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/desconhecimento-falta-de-controle-e-xenofobia-alimentam-temor-de-coronavirus.shtml) e quase 800 mortes pela Sars (síndrome respiratória aguda grave). Mas os estragos não pararam ali: quatro anos depois, 42% dos sobreviventes haviam desenvolvido algum transtorno mental. 

 A maioria deles (54,5%) manifestou transtorno de estresse pós-traumático, e 39% tiveram depressão, de acordo com um estudo publicado em 2014 na revista especializada East Asian Arch Psychiatry.

 O medo é comum em momentos de crise em saúde pública e, portanto, faz parte da resposta a epidemias, aponta outro artigo, publicado na semana passada na revista médica The Lancet e que trata dos impactos da nova epidemia de coronavírus para a saúde mental.

 Segundo os autores, há poucos dados sobre o programa desenvolvido pelo governo chinês para acompanhamento e tratamento psicossocial de seus cidadãos, mas, por outro lado, há um extenso plano de “intervenção emergencial em crises psicológicas” para profissionais de saúde da China, fruto do aprendizado da epidemia da Sars.

 A cartilha prevê o acompanhamento psicológico de grupos de risco entre os infectados e familiares para prevenção de comportamentos impulsivos e tendências suicidas, por exemplo. 

  No dia 28 de janeiro, o governo chinês inaugurou uma linha direta para que os cidadãos possam ligar para requerer ajuda psicológica emergencial, outra forma de prevenir que o que aconteceu após a epidemia de Sars.

 Pacientes infectados ou com suspeita de infecção podem manifestar, principalmente, medo das consequências de portar a doença. Já aqueles que estão em quarentena podem ter experiências que vão do tédio à solidão, incluindo acessos de raiva. 

 Esses sentimentos e sintomas de sofrimento psíquico podem levar a transtornos de ansiedade, ataques de pânico, depressão, agitação psicomotora (movimentos indesejados devido ao estresse), delírio e suicídio. 

 Os efeitos psicológicos de epidemias também podem afetar equipes em hospitais. Durante a Sars, os profissionais de saúde que participaram dos esforços contra a doença apresentaram transtorno de estresse pós-traumático, depressão, ansiedade, medo e frustração devido à possibilidade de serem contaminados e contaminarem familiares e amigos e à impossibilidade de salvar todos os pacientes atendidos.

 Até a terça (11), mais de 43 mil pessoas foram infectadas pelo novo coronavírus e [outras 1.018 morreram](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/numero-de-mortos-por-coronavirus-chines-chega-a-81.shtml). A epidemia atual já superou a Sars em todos os níveis. 

 Os dados são importantes e são atualizados diariamente como serviço à população, mas o excesso de informação pode levar ao medo, senão pânico, segundo o artigo. 

 Ana Bock, professora de psicologia social da PUC de São Paulo, explica que o medo da epidemia pode gerar a sensação de que ela é ainda maior. 

 “Apesar da informação qualificada, as pessoas nem sempre estão preparadas para compreendê-la. O medo está ligado à fragilidade de lidar com a informação”, afirma. 

 Já o professor de medicina da USP (Universidade de São Paulo) Esper Kallás aponta que apesar de haver muita informação disponível, a divulgação e a discussão sobre o tema podem ser benéficos. Para ele, cada segundo gasto em conversas sobre ciência é, na verdade, um investimento.

 “Vejo o acesso à informação como oportunidade de discutir saúde pública com a população, de discutir investimento em pesquisa. Acho que isso constrói uma relação com a sociedade que nos permite avançar nesses assuntos.”

 Além do sofrimento psicológico de pessoas que tem acesso à essas informações, Bock ressalta que pessoas já fragilizadas e/ou com quadros de transtornos mentais podem sofrer neste momento com mais intensidade. 

 No domingo (9), 34 [brasileiros e seus parentes que foram evacuados da China chegaram ao Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/brasileiros-que-estavam-no-epicentro-do-coronavirus-na-china-chegam-em-goias-onde-ficarao-em-quarentena.shtml) para ficar de quarentena em uma base militar em Anápolis (GO). 

 Eles estão sujeitos aos efeitos do isolamento na saúde mental, mas há diferentes tipos de isolamento. 

 De acordo com Bock, o isolamento costuma ser usado para promover sofrimento, mas o caso não se aplica aos repatriados. “O isolamento é uma questão ruim para o psicológico. Quando colocamos um filho de castigo, o mandamos para o quarto, para ficar sozinho. Nas prisões, há a solitária como punição”, lembra. 

 No caso dos [brasileiros repatriados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/02/resultado-de-exame-em-brasileiros-que-vieram-de-wuhan-da-negativo-para-coronavirus.shtml), buscou-se atenuar a sensação de isolamento. No local onde eles passarão as próximas semanas, há brinquedos para as sete crianças que integram o grupo, telão para filmes, Wi-Fi, plantas, doces e comidas saborosas.

 O plano de quarentena do governo, disponível no site do Ministério da Saúde, indica que há uma equipe de assistência psicossocial à disposição dos brasileiros para atenuar o sofrimento psíquico e prevenir o transtorno de estresse pós-traumático). 

 A equipe conta com um psicologo e um psiquiatra. Além da avaliação psicológica primária, já na chegada, haverá avaliações semanais. Em casos de sofrimento psíquico, o plano prevê avaliação de risco e abordagem terapêutica (psicoterapia, administração de remédios e observação)."

This year’s Chinese Grand Prix will not take place as scheduled on April 19 because of the coronavirus outbreak. The Times understands that the decision has been made not to stage what would have been the fourth race of the season on that date in Shanghai.

Discussions are said to be continuing over whether to postpone the race or cancel it altogether. With the calendar at a record-high 22 races this season, it is dificult to see where a rescheduled China race would slot in. If Formula One did try to squeeze it into the second half of the season, it could result in races being held on three or even four consecutive weekends, something to which the teams would likely object."""

A pesar de las deficiencias, desabastos y etc., que popula en nuestro sistema de salud, encubrir un caso de Coronavirus por intereses partidiarios sería muy perjudicial. Si hay algo que nos ha distinguido ante la OMS es nuestra gran respuesta sanitaria antes las alertas de salud, por ejemplo, la CDC y la OMS felicitaron a México por la excelente respuesta ante la pandemia de influenza H1N1 ([Fuente](https://web.archive.org/web/20090707164223/http://www.optimum.net/News/AP/Article?articleId=579513&categoryId=43) en el 2009. 

El país nada tiene que ganar por encubrir un caso de Coronavirus pero mucho que perder en cuestión de vigilancia sanitaria internacional, sanciones y demás programas que nos hemos hecho acredores por nuestros trabajadores de la salud. 

Confieso que si tenemos deficiencias y pudiéramos estar mejor pero lo que tenemos disponible en relación a sistemas de vigilancia y programas de acción, es mas que capaz para conllevarlo cuando llegue a nosotros. 

Finalmente, en su mayoría, la participación ciudadana es excelente. Siempre lo veo cuando son las campañas de vacunación y alertas sanitarias, que por cierto, nuestra cobertura en vacunación frecuentemente es de las mejores a nivel mundial con una aplicación de vacunas de manera gratuita y accesible ante 14 enfermedades, de hecho, frecuentemente alcazamos coberturas del 90% en menores de cinco años, mucho mas que el estándar de la
OMS del 78% en promedio.

The average person contracts 200 colds in their lifetime. Children have 6-10 colds per year on average. The vast majority of these cases are solved by the bodies immune system with no harm. 

Harm does happen though. In the U.S. alone, the flu has already caused an estimated 19 million illnesses, 180,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths this season. We've been dealing with this as humans for thousands of years, and have gotten better and better at it.

I’m sure you and everyone else can see the types of comments I make. Yes, I enjoy research and also critical analysis (did a minor in formal logic) so generally my contributions come from reading further into whatever was posted, offering more resources, alternative explanations, critical analysis of a chain of argument or logic, and obviously as an IR major I tend to be interested in the political dynamic we see unfolding as well as the behaviours of different actors in the media and social media in terms of their agendas and how they pursue them.

I could only have commented on 2-3 posts related to John Campbell and only in the past day or two. That is because after initially watching some I wasn’t interested and usually wouldn’t open them. However then people like yourself starting shilling about him on posts not related to him, which seemed quite suspicious. And frankly his content is not that reliable and I would argue does come with an agenda (OR he is simply repeating commentary of other sources Whilst being unaware of their agenda). Either way, would not recommend people use him as their main source of info (albeit I can’t think of many or any sources I’d recommend doing this with for coronavirus at the moment).

There are multiple strains of the influenza virus, yet for each of them we call the related disease the same. Some flu-variants are nastier than others, but they're all called ""flu"".

SARS and Covid-19 are very similar in symptoms and are both caused by a different strain of coronavirus. The two strains are quite similar, as research has shown, so it makes sense to group both diseases under the same name: SARS. And while we're at it, put MERS there too.

For scientific purposes you can add a number to the disease to distinguish between the different strains, e.g. SARS-19. But for day-to-day use, just stick with SARS."

no one knows when services will be back to normal.  some reports show every one person who has the virus is capable of spreading the virus to up to 6 other persons.  it is contagious even when patients are asymptomatic, which makes containment tricky.  quarantine is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus; but how much and long the quarantine should last depends on how many new cases are reported, and there are still new cases are reported every 24hrs, which means quarantine is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  so you can imagine why there is no hard and fast answer for when the post office will be open again."

However, we cannot assume the reported numbers are accurate because 1) it's apparently easy to be asymptomatic (which would produce an under count, therefore lowering the mortality rate) 2) it's likely China isn't reporting accurately (but it's impossible to say if they're under counting the deaths or the infections or both and how much)

Medical advancements have been occurring at such an incredible rate, for so long. This clearly has been the main driver of cost increases since when, sometime in the 70's? So say we hit pause on that by implementing price controls or some additional regulation that caps profit. Lots of real world examples for this, with insulin getting lots of attention lately. Let's say the field slows or even stops investing in r&d, taking some time to recoup what they've already invested.

This all makes good sense from an accountant's view. The problem with this approach is how do we get that started again? The coronavirus is a current example where US ability is expected to dominate in r&d. (I never thought it would get significantly bad if we put the lid on it immediately, fwiw) Maybe smaller Countries come up with something first, or something better. Maybe losing dominance in this area isn't a bad thing, since having dominance hasn't worked out for We the People. (We bare the cost of r&d disproportionately)

I dunno. I saw what happened when we ""outsourced"" our manufacturing base. Not sure we should be adding to that list, or leaving ourselves at the mercy of potentially hostile nations. I'm also surrounded by people with maladies for which there is no cure and more r&d is needed, so that certainly slants my bias."

If FOM make the statement they lose the event fee probably. That is maybe why they wait for a regulation of the government or else. 

Of course F1 is important to the Chinese market, too. But they will have to make a decision before teams send of their gear to China which will be very soon and the only sensitive decision at the moment is to not make the event in April 2020. Coronavirus is already a danger now according to the figures of infections and deaths and you don't know currently how it develops in the next 8 weeks. At the moment the death figures are still increasing heavily.

They will of course opt to postphone it and make it later in 2020, but I guess this will nearly be impossible to put it in somewhere in the packed calendar. There will probably be no race promoter that will change the dates with China. Seriously, the rely on their ticket sales and if they have to host in April they have less time to sell tickets and they have a lot to plan in a very short time. 

And I guess the ideas to make it in the summer break or add it to the end of the season (or take Abu Dhabi GP date for China GP and make Abu Dhabi GP two weeks later) will be declined by the teams."

You don’t address the fact that you are wrong about “privilege” in California, where jjd is being tried.

And 131 were disbarred—so what, one attorney withheld knowledge that an innocent man was in prison for murder. He said “I could have” ( not would have) “lost my lie-cense”.

So what? People give their lives doing what’s right. Soldiers, police, that physician in China who identified coronavirus.

So basically it’s about a potential loss of income, your “bright line”.

The “line” is not so bright, and I and many others have noticed it does take much “bright shiny coin“ to move it."

Many times, I have nearly fainted even after a short walk away from the bed.  I am the only abled-bodied weakling that needs a walking stick to the doctor’s (and my poor parents have to accompany me to make sure I don’t collapse - because I have). I perspire like crazy, and that is just for the normal run of the mill flu that millions of people get every year. 

I cannot take a day’s MC or 2 either. I need the entire week off. I don’t know why my body is this way. I wish it isn’t (actually I wish to never fall ill). 

Some people say the coronavirus is mild. But no one really knows, do they?

> 
> -- Authorities have begun closed-off management in some residential buildings in Huanggang, one of the cities worst hit by the epidemic in Hubei.
> 
> The buildings include those hosting confirmed cases of infection, suspected cases, patients with fever and possible link to the virus, and those who had close contacts with infected patients.

The two makeshift hospitals --Leishenshan (Thunder God Mountain) and Huoshenshan (Fire God Mountain), together can accommodate 2,600 beds.
> 
> -- China released an application guide to solicit research and development projects on rapid test kits for the novel coronavirus. The on-site quick testing equipment and reagents should be able to identify confirmed infection among suspected patients within 1.5 hours to help prevent and control the epidemic.

> And true enough, “you don’t have to be on the frontline fighting the coronavirus to make a difference,” wrote Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his recent Facebook post on Tuesday (11 Feb). 

> While it can be disheartening to see the coronavirus cases count increase day by day, whether in Singapore or around the world, not all hope is lost.

> True warriors don’t succumb to fear. They continue to fight and help fellow comrades (read: Singaporeans) pull through tough times.

> Super Mummies In Singapore Come Together To DIY Hand Sanitisers

> And now, residents from Teck Ghee have joined in to launch their own initiatives, according to Minister Lee. 

> Mummies from Teck Ghee Parkview took precious time off their Saturday morning to DIY hand sanitisers, guided by an instructor.

> Apart from that, Minister Lee also mentioned that notice boards were also put up at masks distribution points and residential areas in the estate so that fellow residents could send cheer and encouragement to frontline workers. 

> Other heartwarming instances in Singapore saw school children sending supportive messages to healthcare workers while student volunteers from The National University of Singapore and National Technological University support their fellow schoolmates through food delivery services. 

> They were said to have took turns delivering food alongside “notes of support and concern to their university mates on leave of absence”. 

> These actions might not be loud, nor big, but they are happening all around us. It takes just a little bit of effort from each and every one of us to see the difference. 

> “Let us all do our part to help and encourage one another. Together, we will overcome this trying time and emerge stronger,” wrote Mr Lee.

> “This kampung spirit and unity is what makes us Singaporean.”

**Article**:

> MOSCOW (AP) — One patient jumped out of a hospital window to escape her quarantine and another managed to break out by disabling an electronic lock.

> Two Russian women who were kept in isolation for possible inflection by a new virus say they fled from their hospitals this month because of uncooperative doctors, poor conditions and fear they would become infected. Russian health authorities haven’t commented on their complaints.

> The incidents occurred amid the outbreak of the virus in China that has already infected more than 40,000 people worldwide. In Russia, only two cases of COVID-19 have been reported. Nevertheless, the authorities took vast measures to prevent the new disease from spreading and hospitalized hundreds of people who returned from China as a precaution. 

> Many of those quarantined in different Russian hospitals complained about dire conditions of isolation rooms and lack of cooperation from doctors, uncertain about quarantine protocols. 

> Both women said their hospital ordeals began after returning from Hainan, a tropical region of China popular with Russian tourists.

> In a lengthy account on Instagram published Friday, a woman with the screen name of GuzelNeder said her son came down with a cough and a fever of 37.3 C (99.2 F) four days after the family’s return to their home in the city of Samara. She called emergency services, who diagnosed the boy as having a viral respiratory infection and who said the mother and the son must go to a hospital for coronavirus tests.

> The hospital promised test results within three days, then extended it to five, she said, and meanwhile the boy responded to treatment with medication and an inhalator, she wrote. When she tried to press for results, hospital personnel obstructed her, she said.

> Meanwhile, she had become concerned about lax procedures in the hospital, saying that some medical personnel came to the isolation area without masks or threw their protective clothing on the floor. 

> Her anxiety soared on the fifth day, when she began to feel badly. She asked her husband to bring her a home pregnancy test, and “after two minutes of wringing my hands in anticipation, it came on the screen — PREGNANT,” she wrote.

> Her husband argued with the doctor that she and their son should be released because of her condition and concern of infection. The doctor said they had to be held for 14 days even if the virus test came back negative.

> “My son was hysterical,” she wrote. “There was no exit for us other than to leave the hospital without authorization, through the window,” Guzel said.

> Police later questioned her at home, but no charges have been reported. “Everyone in my family is alive and healthy, thank god,” she wrote.

> The other woman, Alla Ilyina, said in an Instagram post she came down with a sore throat several days after returning to St. Petersburg, Russia’s second largest city, from Hainan. 

> Ilyina called emergency services, and medics brought her to a hospital for coronavirus testing, promising to let her go after 24 hours. The next day she was told she tested negative for the virus, but had to remain quarantined for two weeks. 

> “Wild,” Ilyina wrote. “All three tests showed I was completely healthy, so why the hell the quarantine?” 

> Her isolation room was dire, she told the Fontanka newspaper — no books, no shampoo, no Wi-Fi a wastebasket that was never emptied, the door secured by an electronic lock. 

> Frustrated, she figured out how to short-circuit the electronic lock and escaped from the hospital on Friday. 

> Neither the hospital nor police have followed up on her escape, which leads her to believe her health is OK.

> “If I were sick, they would have swamped me with phone calls,” Fontanka quoted her as saying.

> On Tuesday evening, Russian media reported that the hospital reported Ilyina’s escape to the police, and that a criminal investigation could be launched into the incident. 

> Both women offered no immediate comment to The Associated Press. 

> Quarantine protocols in relation to the outbreak vary throughout Russia. In some regions, health officials isolate Chinese nationals who have recently returned from China, and in others everyone who reports symptoms resembling those of the new virus are subject to a 14-day quarantine. 

> Rospotrebnadzor, Russia’s public health watchdog, hasn’t responded to a request for comment on whether the women were allowed to leave the hospitals. 

> On Wednesday, the Fon...

Bring down prices a little but still a more reliable product than what the blackmarket produces.  Beverages aren’t expected to be a massive market because of the restrictions around cannabis now.  What makes beer such a big market are all the places where it is sold.  Those places don’t exist in this market right now.  

I’m sorry, how can you say not having enough stores is not the significant problem it is.  Only 8% of Canadians buy anything online, the rest pretty much prefer a store experience either because they want to pay cash or they need some education about these new products they don’t have the patience or time to look up online. Up until a couple weeks ago we only had 28 stores in the province with 1/3 of the countries population.  27 in Quebec with the other 1/3.  Thats a HUGE FUCKING BOTTLENECK for distribution.  Especially for 2.0 when you have a lot of new products that people haven’t seen before.  Beverages would complicate all to heck that distribution because we have to assume they may need refrigeration, they are bigger and bulkier. So, having only 30 friggin stores (normal sized ones not box sized ones) is a problem.  

As for capacity.  Its not that they are growing too much, its that the quality and varieties they grew were not what people wanted.  It takes a long time to adjust cultivars when you are an LP because of the growing cycles and testing cycle.  CGC grew a bunch of varieties no one wanted and so they have a lot of excess product.  There were some issues about quality, whether it was true or not, but in this marketplace with lack of brainwashing marketing the way product becomes known is word of mouth.  If the word on the street is that your product is crap then guess what happens.  The only way to fix that is to grow good stuff and get people to try it.  I hear great things about pedros (wine gums), and broken coast product.  They don’t advertise so those are reviews of their product by consumers who love it. 

I agree, its not over.  This industry will keep getting bigger and bigger.  But the states have a lot of fragmentation that won’t be resolved until its federally legal and as we saw in the judgement against a Michigan man by a federal judge that means that cannabis in the states are still under threat which isn’t good for business.  The states act will alleviate that but its not going to happen as long as republicans control the senate.  The expansion happening in the rest of the world is amazing, its not fast by the standards of a business looking for income but its creating opportunities to be ready when Europe blows open.  The WHO was supposed to deliver its opinion on cannabis in March.  Not sure if they will stick to that timeframe with Coronavirus going on but would be nice if they did."

This post shows a very basic misunderstanding of the asymmetric nature of risk. It also fails to classify risk in personal vs. societal terms. Yes, as a non-Asian young man living in the US, your relative risk of death from coronavirus is low right now. That said, the downside risk of this virus normalizing itself globally and becoming flu 2.0, albeit much more lethal, may be low to moderate but the consequences are devastating. Better to over-react and be wrong 99 times and right 1 time then right 99 times with 10s of millions dead over the next few decades for the 1 time you are wrong.

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-2019-nCoV-severity-10-02-2020.pdf

##Summary 
We  present  case  fatality  ratio (CFR) estimates  for  three  strata  of  2019-nCoV infections.  For cases detected  in Hubei,  we  estimate the CFR to  be 18%  (95% credible  interval: 11%-81%).  For  cases detected in travellers outside mainland China, we obtain central estimates of the CFR in the range 1.2-5.6% depending on the statistical methods, with substantial uncertainty around these central values. Using  estimates  of  underlying  infection  prevalence  in  Wuhan  at  the  end  of  January  derived  from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to Japan and Germany, we adjusted the estimates of CFR from either the early epidemic in Hubei Province, or from cases reported outside mainland China, to obtain estimates of the overall CFR in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries  will  vary  depending  on  the  sensitivity  of  different  surveillance  systems  to  detect  cases  of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear. Furthermore, all estimates rely on limited data on the typical time intervals from symptom onset to death or recovery which influences the CFR estimates."

Clarification: It was reported that I said that I believe that that reports of the Coronavirus are exaggerated. This was a misleading characterization of an answer I gave when asked what I thought of the virus, so let me clarify what I said and think. (1/4)

I think that I am a “dumb shit” relative to experts on the subject so I shouldn’t be asked, but if I were to guess, there is a wide range of possible outcomes. 

I think the most likely outcome is that this virus will be a larger version of SARS that will have a significant temporary effect but won’t have a big long term influence, so the downward market price moves related to it are probably becoming exaggerated

The suspicious case was reported by the Ministry of Health and the State Health Secretariat of Paraná (Sesa) on Monday (10). The child was in Taishan (Guangdong) in southern China in January.

According to the FMS, the child improved. The test that can confirm or rule out the diagnosis of the disease should be completed within 48 hours.

Infectologist Gabriela Margraf, who is accompanying the case, said there is no risk of transmission of the disease in Ponta Grossa.

""The child was instructed to stay at home, isolated, so that there is no risk of transmission until the result is confirmed or excluded,"" explained the infectologist.

According to FMS, the child has not yet gone to school this year. However, the boy passed through public places, such as the airports of Curitiba and Guarulhos (SP).

The suspected case of Ponta Grossa is the third reported by the Ministry of Health in Paraná. The first two investigated cases have already been ruled out . There are no diagnoses of the new coronavirus in Brazil.

Annabel Wucinski is in isolation at Rady Children's Hospital awaiting the results of additional testing for coronavirus, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.
The girl and her father, Frank Wucinski, *were first taken to the hospital last Wednesday, the day a plane carrying 167 passengers from Wuhan, China touched down at MCAS Miramar*

The CDC said that the father, daughter and two other patients first showed signs of fever and cough that warranted their transfer to isolation rooms at local hospitals.

After three days in isolation, the father and daughter tested negative for coronavirus and were released, CDC Dr. Christopher Braden said. The pair were taken back to MCAS Miramar where they expected to finish their 14-day quarantine before returning home ***But a week later, Annabel Wucinski was taken back to the hospital after exhibiting additional symptoms*** that the CDC wanted to evaluate, Braden said.

*Braden said that they still have confidence in the initial negative test results.*

The announcement was made at a press conference that also shared details about a mix-up that led to the release of the patient with San Diego County's first confirmed case of coronavirus.

The woman was in isolation at UC San Diego Health, as was a second patient who was awaiting test results.

The remaining passengers were confined to a quarantine facility, protected by U.S. Marshals, though some expressed frustration with the handling of their care.

A petition signed by some patients was addressed to the CDC on Wednesday, which outlined suggestions to the quarantine process like more testing, better separation between patients and disinfection of common areas.

The World Health Organization named the disease caused by the virus as COVID-19. The illness was first reported in December and connected to a food market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak has largely been concentrated.





<<<<>>>><<<<>>>><<<<>>

So it appears they showed symptoms of fever and cough, after arriving in evacuation flight, and were put into quarantine. They tested positive 3 days later and were released only to show more developed symptoms a week later.  That's pretty alarming. It's still possible they've contracted a different virus after leaving and its completely unrelated however that would be some extremely coincidental luck imo. I hope it proves to not be the coronoavirus.  I'll post updates as I see them

>6. Placental Pathology of SARS In the only reported study of the placental pathology of mothers with SARS, Ng et al. \[41\] reported the findings from 7 pregnant women infected with SARS‐CoV. In the case of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS‐CoV infection during the 1st trimester of pregnancy, the placentas were found to be normal. Three placentas were delivered from pregnancies in which the mothers had acute SARS‐CoV infection—these were abnormal and demonstrated increased subchorionic and intervillous fibrin, a finding that can be associated with abnormal maternal blood flow to the placenta. In the placentas of 2 women who were convalescing from SARS‐CoV infection in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy the placentas were highly abnormal. They showed extensive fetal thrombotic vasculopathy with areas of avascular chorionic villi—chronic findings of fetal vascular malperfusion. These 2 pregnancies also were complicated by oligohydramnios and had poor obstetrical outcomes— both infants had developed IUGR. It is interesting that villitis, the microscopic finding of inflammation of the chorionic villi that is the histologic hallmark of many maternal hematogenous infections that are transmitted through the placenta to the fetus, was not identified in any of these placentas.

Again, although SARS-CoV is a coronavirus, this DOES NOT mean that COVID will be the same - not enough information at this stage."

I absolutely believe from personal experience that the Chinese would and could cook the books. Things probably are much more serious than the Chinese government wants to let on, though whether that means Four Horsemen apocalypse or just a serious contagion is still a fair question.

After all, the Chinese have every motivation to lie -- the integrity of the state is intensely bound up with economic success. Coronavirus represents a massive disruption. And China's economy is much weaker than most people suppose, would not survive a serious deadly contagion in the same form. China's economy is built on the lie that China can become the consumer and industrial power of the world. But that consumer spending is built on its industrial might, which was itself only possible through aggressive investment schemes brokered between corporate and the CCP. I am hardly oversimplifying, China's economy is as strong as we allow it to be, which is why Trump's tariffs have hurt them far more than us."

2020-02-12,Wickedkiss246,AMA,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/ezrn2x/im_a_us_citizen_aboard_the_diamond_princess/fhe61fa/,"WUHAN, China—Coughing badly, Zhu Chunxia sat on a sidewalk in the rain on Monday, awaiting transport to a facility where her apartment complex’s residential committee said she could be treated for the new coronavirus sweeping through this central Chinese city.

The ride never came. Though her doctor was almost certain she was infected with the virus, a throat-swab test she had taken came back negative, which meant the facility wouldn’t take her.

“They said we didn’t qualify,” said the 36-year-old mother of two girls. “They wanted positive results.”

In Wuhan, the epicenter of a viral outbreak that has sickened more than 44,000 people and killed more than 1,100, doubts are proliferating among residents over the accuracy of the testing kits that Chinese health authorities are using to diagnose cases.

Medical experts around the globe have expressed fears that the scale of the outbreak could be much larger than Chinese data suggests—in large part because of concerns about potential flaws in testing. Independent experts say many tens of thousands of Wuhan residents are likely infected by the coronavirus, while the city’s government puts the tally at less than 20,000.

Only one in 19 infected people in Wuhan was being tested and confirmed, according to an estimate by Imperial College London as of Jan. 31.

The possibility of large numbers of undiagnosed, and thus untreated, coronavirus cases has inspired calls from doctors and epidemiologists for Chinese hospitals to use chest scans in diagnosing the new virus, instead of relying on swab tests, which medical professionals believe are finicky and unlikely to pick up on infections in the lower part of the lung.

Wuhan’s top Communist Party official, Ma Guoqiang, cast doubt on the swab test at a press briefing on Monday, urging those with negative results to try again to be sure.

“One needs to wait one day later, to get another negative, in order to rule out [the virus],” he said.

China’s National Health Commission said last week that chest scans could be used to diagnose cases in Wuhan’s surrounding province of Hubei. Authorities, however, still only consider a patient a confirmed case if he or she tests positive for the virus—and that by and large requires taking a nucleic-acid test. With hospital beds limited, authorities have given preference to patients testing positive for coronavirus, and doctors continue to order such tests.

The nucleic-acid test—using nasal or throat mucus collected with cotton swabs—is being widely employed in China to diagnose coronavirus cases because it is fast and can be performed by regular hospital staff, including nurses. Still, improper technique can lead to negative tests, say doctors.

“The sampling staff is seriously inadequate,” said one doctor at a large hospital in Wuhan who declined to be named. “Not all the people are professionals.”

Subpar testing is an urgent concern for those researchers studying how to fight the virus, as well as for ordinary people trying to gauge their risk of exposure. For now, both groups are dependent on the official figures provided by Chinese authorities.

Chinese hospitals have focused on treating confirmed patients, often neglecting those who can’t prove they have the virus. People who are misdiagnosed sometimes return home, get more sick and infect others around them. Some return to clinics for additional testing, heightening the risk of being further exposed to the virus.

There is also a financial burden for those who suffer from the virus without testing positive for it.

Wang Hongyan, whose husband tested negative despite a lung infection, said her family paid 10,000 yuan ($1,430) for medical care and were unable to receive the subsidies granted to confirmed coronavirus patients.

“Right now there are a lot of fake negatives,” said Ms. Wang. “You come to the hospital and 90% of the people around us are like this.”

In Wuhan, locals have been especially suspicious of the city’s official data because they see an overstretched hospital system, with many feverish residents choosing to try to recover on their own. The Wall Street Journal found half a dozen patients in Wuhan with clear symptoms of a viral infection who at one point during their illness had tested negative for the coronavirus. Some tested positive on subsequent tests.

When 57-year-old Weng Wanjin fell into a coma at home, his wife, Hu Lihua, found someone to rush him to a hospital. Scans showed a serious lung infection but the test didn’t detect the virus.

“When we got the first result, the doctor said it was impossible,” Ms. Hu said. The doctor recommended they get a second test. Two days later, on Feb. 7, the results confirmed the doctor’s suspicion.

Some feel certain they were infected but haven’t gotten confirmation. Wan Pei, a telecommunications worker, quarantined his 54-year-old mother in a hotel at the request of her residential committee, local authorities who are helping to manage health care and quarantines. The mother didn’t get admitted into a hospital because a nasal nucleic-acid test showed virus levels short of the threshold for a positive result.

Her next two tests, via throat-swabs, came back negative again. That is despite a Jan. 30 chest X-ray showing infection in both lungs that the hospital report said was “in accordance with the symptoms of viral pneumonia.”

Even when performed correctly, the throat-swab test might be inadequate because it is designed to pick up infections in the upper airway, doctors say. Detecting infections lower down requires inserting an endoscope into the lungs, a specialized and more invasive process that is too demanding for Wuhan’s hospitals to perform on a mass scale.

“The more you go down, the more likely it is” to be accurate, Peng Zhiyong, a doctor from Central Hospital of Wuhan, said at a Hubei province media briefing. “But we can’t do it.”

Mr. Peng said only 30% of patients may test positive in the upper respiratory tract.

In some cases examined by the Journal, patients who came out negative on the nucleic-acid test were diagnosed by their doctors as having viral infections in the lower lung.

It isn’t yet known whether the new virus tends to infect the lower part of the lung more often, as happened with severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. John M. Nicholls, a pathologist at Hong Kong University whose team is looking into that question, says the current outbreak would be more difficult to manage if that turns out to be the case.

But it seems like China has less labs than they should have in comparison with the rest of the world.

If I'm not mistaken U.S has 15 BSL-4 labs and over 1400 BSL-3 labs, even India has 4 BSL-4 labs and Taiwan 2 BSL-4 (not sure about how many BSL-3 labs there). 

Some countries in Africa are sending the samples to another country that has a lab able to test them. That's a reason for big delays outside China, they have to send the samples to other countries or to a certain city.

Although it is possible to test in BSL-2 labs if it gets really serious, it's risky because the samples (swabs) can infect humans and objects. But it's possible to make a lab specific for testing the samples for coronavirus with special safety measurements, in a university for example, they haven't done that yet, but it's possible to trade some safety in order to increase the research speed.

About 10 years ago, Swine Flu infected 60 million people only in USA, so they started treating a lot of patients that most likely had the Flu, even without making a PCR test on them and thankfully it was controlled and only killed a ""few"" people (about 600,000 worldwide and probably infected 600,000 million people, big number and very sad, but wasn't the end of the world).

Let's pray it doesn't reach a country like Venezuela until they develop a vaccine or effective treatments, young and health people probably won't die, but it can be destructive in poor communities, Venezuela can't even treat seasonal Influenza."

“The genetics can tell us the true timing of the first cases” and whether they occurred earlier than officials realized, said molecular biologist Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research, an expert on viral genomes. “It can also tell us how the outbreak started — from a single event of a virus jumping from an infected animal to a person or from a lot of animals being infected. And the genetics can tell us what’s sustaining the outbreak — new introductions from animals or human-to-human transmission.”

Scientists in China sequenced the virus’s genome and made it [available](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) on Jan. 10, just a month after the Dec. 8 report of the first case of pneumonia from an unknown virus in Wuhan.

First they had to deal with the Hong Kong uprising. 

Now they have to deal with this.

Their standing in the international community and economy are going to sink and they will be preoccupied with *these kinds of things* until they sign a few trade deals with the US.

Option 4. A recombined virus made in a laboratory for the purpose of creating a vaccine.

Basically TLDR: IV vitamin C cures just about any infection but no pharmaceutical company will sponsor a study that would put them out of business. 

The current studies on vitamin C show it doesn't help because they're using to small of doses in the trials. Like 500 mg when it should be 50 grams.

This clinical trial against coronavirus will compare 24 grams of vitamin C IV drip to a plain IV drip.

As a preface, this is not a rebuttal defending any of Inovio's business practices. 
  
  
The reason why I can see this as a possibility (whether it be Inovio or some other pharma company) is because of an article that came out last week about it's similarities to HIV-1 with regard to it's binding sites, aka it's arms that reach out and connect the virus to the surface of a host cell so that the viral load can then be dispensed into the cell. Why this is useful is because we can use an inoculated vaccine really easily if we know how it binds and we know it's DNA and how it works based on it's classification as a coronavirus. There's algorithms that will spit out thousands of derivatives of binding sites very quickly in most R&D labs when doing drug discovery. After that it's just a matter of choosing which key you want to use to open the lock for lack of a better metaphor.
  
  
Vaccines are probably one of the easier classes of drug discovery development in the pharma R&D world. The more difficult ones are like psychiatric meds, cancer, long-term care like diabetes, biologics, etc. Vaccines are a one hitter quitter, it either works or it doesn't and the worst side effects are injection site local pain and/or slight cold like symptoms for a day or two (yes, I know this is a bit of an exaggeration to bundle all vaccines into one basket but I am using this example in regards to viruses that cause things like the flu, pneumonia, etc. to make it relatable to this specific infectious disease)."

That’s why it’s so hard to test thousands of patients everyday, and that’s why countries outside China take days or weeks to confirmed their cases, the only solution is waiting for different kind of tests that are already being develop (anti body, RT-PCR, RT-qPCR...) so they can decrease the number of false negatives. It’s very expensive though, we are talking about billions of dollars for China, unless they treat the suspected cases as confirmed cases, so they can skip this process for most of people and only test the ones they are really undecided yet."

You can be the person who makes the ""Let's calm down guys!"" post every time we lose or the person that says ""I'm not watching again this season. Peace out bitches!"" 

It really doesn't matter. Neither add literally anything. At no point has anyone read either of those types of posts and changed anything. 

I was frustrated the first week along with many people. I've been following the team since TRM was the top laner, I'm a lifer. After spending this long offseason waiting for Spring, after getting DD, after getting hype about how this team is built for proactive early aggression, I was extremely let down by the first week and how our mid game looked passive and indecisive. I'm sure most fans were. 

Don't tell people they can't express that. That's the whole point of these sub's. To express yourself. To communicate with other fans. There's a difference in being frustrated and saying ""Fuck this team I hope they get the coronavirus..."" etc. 

Most of what I saw were people saying dumb shit like I mentioned above. Others always make single statements like ""DD is trash lul."" But are those really fans? I don't really think so. And if they are, they are most likely just venting after a bad play.

TL;DR Just let people do what they do. It's part of being a fan. If it's over-the-top abusive, downvote or report and move on."
