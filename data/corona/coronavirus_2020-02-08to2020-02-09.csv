Of course if you click that link you'll be asked to pay $30 to read the article. If you're a researcher working at a well-funded university you can probably avoid this cost if your institution has a subscription. But if you're a government official, doctor, or member of the public, or even a researcher in a developing country whose university has little or no journal subscriptions, bad luck.

The academic publishing industry's business model involves locking away information that could potentially save lives behind paywalls. If the scientists were actually compensated by the journals, or universities didn't have to pay millions of dollars per year in subscription fees, then maybe, just maybe, they could have redirected that money towards the research they wanted to do.

* Many of the 8 'whistleblowers' referred to here were censured for talking about a SARS-like virus in a private Wechat DM for medical professionals during the initial emergence of the disease, not for reporting the 'true' severity of the outbreak.
* Disease outbreaks frequently lead to social, political and economic crises (for an interesting discussion of the SARS outbreak, see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92479/)); in my (limited and imperfect) understanding of the Chinese constitution, the 'subversion of state power' clause might cover unauthorised dissemination of information like this through unofficial channels because of the potential social impacts.
* Speaking of social impacts, there's a lot of unfounded speculation and incorrect information spreading like wildfire, and it's causing enough people to act irrationally that you can see the effects in unaffected countries - [surgical masks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/coronavirus-masks-hoarding.html) and [hand sanitiser](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/hand-sanitiser-price-doubles-face-mask-shortage-amid-coronavirus-panic-20200203-p53xfm.html) are selling out in countries that are unaffected like the USA or Australia.

[https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20203](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20203)

 At present, it is tempting to estimate the case fatality rate by  dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases.  The resulting number, however, does not represent the true case fatality  rate and might be off by orders of magnitude. Diagnosis of viral  infection will precede recovery or death by days to weeks and the number  of deaths should therefore be compared to the past case counts –  accounting for this delay increasing the estimate of the case fatality  rate. On the other hand, cases in official statistics are likely a  severe underestimate of the total – accounting for this underestimate  will decrease the case fatality rate. The time between diagnosis and  death/recovery and the degree of underreporting will vary over time as  well as between cities and countries. A precise estimate of the case  fatality rate is therefore impossible at present."

The panic-buying of toilet paper (plus rice & S$50's worth of veggies at one go) is due to influence from Chinese social media (WeChat, Weibo, etc.), which non-Chinese folks aren't likely to be following avidly, if at all.  Were Chinese social media to suddenly start rumour-mongering about toothpicks & rice wine, there is a high chance that we may see local (Chinese) shoppers start stock-piling on toothpicks & rice wine as well.

> After *rumours circulated that China had forced toilet paper manufacturers to make face masks, toilet paper this week disappeared from supermarket shelves*. Local shoppers snatched them as they were delivered to shelves and filled their carts with big packages of rolls.


Also, the main underlying trigger seems to be mistrust of the government (in China & in S'pore) ...

During the early stages of an outbreak, reporting of cases skews heavily to the most severe cases. It is likely that people with less severe cases did not receive an accurate diagnosis and just thought they had a flu. As awareness rises, figures will become more reliable.

Also, flu has a vaccine and those most at-risk of complications get vaccinated. Coronavirus does not, so even if the virus is exactly as deadly as flu, you would expect the mortality rate to be higher due to higher rates of children, elderly, immunocompromised etc. catching it.

Instead of FIFO, random or severe/critical first they moved to mildest sympthoms first.

Which makes sense if you want to optimize health care provided and infected people removal from the streets.

Basically you treat anyone with pneumonua as if it was positive, do not test them, and test only doubtfull ones.

Outcome:

- more people treated as if they had coronavirus (even if they dont... Which probably have, anyway)
- less infected people walking on the streets.
- less reports on infected and deaths by coronavirus (those who you are caring who has pneumonia but you didnt tested yet. If they die before you can do it... They dont add to the total).

Win-win for everyone."

Let's face it, N95 masks aren't going to cut it if the experts advise you to only wear them for no longer than a few hours. So I bought a mask with P100 filters, which should be enough to block out the strain of coronavirus.

One of the reviews on amazon says that you only need to change the filters ""once every few months"", but this is for industrial work such as painting. Does anybody know how often is ideal to change them for this virus?

I'd just like to know before the freakout begins and these filters start to sell out as much as the N95 masks. If we can figure it out here, everyone on this sub should be prepared with much info as possible."

From 06 Feb to 07 Feb 2020 evening, CNA initally aggregated the quarantined *Diamond Princess* cruise ship's 2019-nCoV cases under Japan's tally, so the number of infection cases in Japan appeared to have ridiculously doubled, tripled & then quadrupled overnight.

When I looked at CNA's tally table again on 07 Feb 2020 (19:51 hrs update), CNA had segregated *Diamond Princess*'s cases -- which I suppose is not only fairer to Japan, but also more epidemiologically reflective of the situation. Otherwise, imagine a newly-arrived Martian (or an ignorant Earthling) taking the aggregated figures at face value, & thinking that Japan must be a dangerous place with a broken public health system ...

Here's what's happening RIGHT NOW. Major airlines are on the verge of bankruptcy. Cathay Pacific just canceled 50% of their flights going forward and they are asking all their employees to take weeks of work off with no pay so they can remain solvent. This 5 star airline consistently ranks among the top in the world and is renown for being well run. Other airlines will fare much worse than this.

Multiple cruises have been quarantined or seriously disrupted. There are currently 3700 people on a cruise ship in Japan that is in a 14 day minimum quarantine. This 14 day quarantine resets whenever a new case of nCoV is discovered onboard. They could be there for MONTHS. Cruiselines like Carnival are outright banning Chinese passengers. There was just another incident in a Carnival cruise that docked near NYC where several passengers were taken out in stretchers from symptoms similar to that of nCoV. Test results are pending. Cruiseline will have a terrible 2020. How many people will want to risk getting quarantined in a small room for up to months on end if a single case of nCoV is found on their ship out of thousands of passengers/crew?

Hotels and pretty much any travel/vacation related major businesses will suffer.

Luxury brands are suffering big time. Chinese buyers are not just bigger sources of revenue from stores in China but also from stores in the West because Chinese travelers like going to the West to buy cheaper luxury goods. Right now, many stores literally cannot open in China and their customers aren't even allowed in the West. They are going to be hurting big in 2020.

Supply chains for almost anything you can think of will be seriously disrupted. I didn't think they would shut Guangdong down as that is perhaps the most crucial part of the global supply chain but they are now putting on a soft quarantine of that region. Almost all electronics manufacturing will be disrupted along with a bunch of other things I can't even imagine at this point.

Basically, the problem is this: major businesses followed a strategy that assumed things about the economy that didn't include China shutting down its country for weeks on end. They are way over capacity. And because of how ""efficient"" these businesses are designed to run, they don't have enough slack in their operations to absorb even a moderately prolonged period of decline in demand. Airlines are in huge trouble because I don't see them surviving very long when they're canceling 50% of flights while paying for staff and other overheads that were meant to service those 50% of flights.

Layoffs are inevitable. Expect major businesses to file for bankruptcy and restructure, especially airlines. Supply chain disruption will cause other industries to suffer too like in this thread with Hyundai but also every electronics brand. Luxury brands will have a terrible year too. Cruise companies may also be in bankruptcy trouble as they are heavily leveraged from their billion dollar new cruise ship investments.

Let's say everything gets under control by tomorrow and China comes back online. We're still going to have bankruptcies in the airline industry and probably cruiseline too because of fear alone. Right now, no reasonable person will want to risk getting on a cruise with thousands of other people."

I would roll it out and pay a little to go out and up to give yourself a chance to be right. Maybe 2 months out. Or 4.

and  
> OP: When your neighbourhood aunties and uncles ...  

A note of caution though about viewing the situation through the lens of unconscious bias ... Are we just seeing *what we want to see* ? If you are an auntie, you would know that aunties with or without cars (& even old uncles lacking cars) simply do not have the strength to carry so much stuff at one go.

Check out [this Straits Times photo by reader Thomas White, taken on 08 Feb 2020](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2020/02/08/whatsapp_image_2020-02-08_at_12.49.49.jpeg) of a typical stockpiler, & captioned: *""A customer was checking out with 16 bags of rice in his trolley at the FairPrice Hub in Joo Koon.""*

This customer with at least 90 kg of rice & a full basket of rapidly-perishable items -- & who probably declined being interviewed -- is definitely not an auntie, or even anywhere near uncle-hood. He looks like the typical r/singapore demographic (M, Chinese, below 40, sufficiently high-SES to make bulk purchases, & probably has a car).

And in front of him are are 2 young ladies with a trolleyful of lightweight junk food -- but this is not unusual, because I'd often seen girls & mothers with an entire trolley/basket filled with junk food (dumped in by the kids) at other times of the year.

There are many other photos (taken by different readers) in the [same ST article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-supermarkets-restock-shelves-after-coronavirus-concerns-lead-to-queues-some), but none of them shows shoppers with *""16 bags of rice""* or even more than 1 bag of rice, although 1 lady (age uncertain, looks younger than auntie-hood as based on her arms) had [3 bundles of toilet paper & 1 bundle of tissue paper (plus 1 bag of rice)](https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2020/02/08/ntucvivo.jpg).

For shoppers who did agree to be interviewed by ST (but apparently declined to have their purchases photographed), it appears that all of the *""just in case""* & *""just buying a little more""* category of bulk-purchasers & stockpilers are young men -- ref: below excerpt. In contrast, the women (aunties or otherwise) interviewed were much more circumspect.

> Cargo driver Ben Aguilar, 33, who was shopping at FairPrice in Hougang 1, said: ""It has never been this crowded. I *bought a lot of processed meat*, since all the fresh meat has already run out.""

> Insurance agent Jeff Chiew, 29, and his wife, who made a trip to Sheng Siong supermarket in Canberra just as it opened, said they are *stocking up on instant noodles, which they do not usually eat*. He said: ""Since everyone is stocking up, we're also doing the same but just buying a little more for standby. Nothing too crazy.""

> There are seven teams comprising 10 people here, working in two shifts from 8.30am till 10pm, seven days a week. Their job - calling people to check if they are ""close contacts"" of coronavirus patients.

> This group of contact tracers was activated when Singapore confirmed its first case of coronavirus infection last month.

> Their job is a critical part of ring-fencing the virus by rounding up patients who may have been infected.

> Close contacts are people who have had prolonged physical contact with or stayed in the same place as the patient.

> It could include, for instance, someone driving the patient from the airport to a hotel, at a time when the person does not yet seem sick.

> Any close contact must be quarantined for 14 days from their last contact with the patient.

> But contact tracing does not start with these teams.

> It begins in the hospital.

> Dr Olivia Oh, assistant director in the Communicable Diseases Division of the Ministry of Health (MOH), said the hospital where the patient is warded would do an activity map - this refers to everything the patient has done and the people he has been with over the previous two weeks.

> Her colleague, Mr Pream Raj, also an assistant director in the division, added: ""The mapping is detailed, 24 hours, minute by minute, with no gaps.""

> If there are gaps, then the contact tracing team would call a patient to try and jog his memory. And if the patient is too sick, they would approach his next of kin instead.

> He said although 14 days may seem like a long time ago, most people have routines, so it is not that difficult to recall what they had been doing.

> If they had meals with people, and because of Chinese New Year many did, they need to remember who was there. If it was at a restaurant, they need to recall if any of the serving staff spent much time with them, or if the contact was casual.

> For the 17 patients from China who were confirmed with the virus here, Dr Oh said they would start the contact tracing from the time they arrived in Singapore, assuming that they had caught the virus while still in China.

> They would get the list of passengers sitting in the same row, as well as two rows in front and two rows behind the patient, from the airline, and get in touch with them.

> Mr Raj said the airlines, taxi companies and Grab, since quite a number of the visitors use that service, have all been very cooperative - they are obliged to provide all information required under the Infectious Diseases Act.

> Sometimes, patients have no taxi receipt, remembering only that they were in a blue cab. The contact tracers would go through the closed circuit television footage at the hotel driveway to identify the taxi.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Get latest updates

> Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far

> Related Story Interactive: Places impacted by the coronavirus so far

> He added that they try to identify and get in touch with all possible close contacts of a patient to verify that what the patient had said was correct within 24 hours.

> If the person is deemed at risk of infection, an MOH officer, together with a Cisco guard, would serve notice of quarantine to the person, who will then be given the choice of staying at home or going to a government quarantine facility if his home premises are not suitable.

> For home quarantine, the person must have a room and toilet that is not shared with anyone else.

> The locations of where individual patients had been is also cross-referenced with other patients' activity maps to see if there are any overlaps.

> These are analysed by another team and any links are flagged, and further cross-checks made.

> Mr Raj said several such links have been found.

> It could be anything from both patients attending the same event to meeting the same person.

[The CDC states that the death burden of influenza is roughly 61,000/45,000,000 infections.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) The fatality percentage of influenza is 0.0013%.

The death burden of the Chinese Coronavirus is 2%-8%.

Let's do some quick math to determine how much more deadly, at a minimum, Coronavirus is compared to influenza virus.

0.02/0.0013= 15.3846153846

At a minimum, Coronavirus is more than **15.4 times** deadlier than the Influenza Virus.

0.08/0.0013= 61.5384615385

At most, it is **61.5 times** deadlier than influenza.

It is clear, for PR reasons, that the Chinese government initially refused to adequately respond to this health crisis by jailing journalists, doctors, and other individuals who reported that something was seriously wrong. Social media/news has been heavily censored, and people continue to face jailings when they expose that the quarantines have come too late, and that much of the suffering going on is being covered up. For monetary reasons, and PR reasons, the US, in response to the crisis, continues to allow people from pandemic infected China to come here and filter out to our universities, and other areas, despite the fact that people fleeing China have been proven, in cases, to lie about their symptoms (see lady in France for example). In areas where they have been, we are now seeing cases of coronavirus, which is bound to happen due to many areas taking in thousands of Chinese students. Considering the transmission rate of the disease, just a handful of cases isn't good. It also ignores history, where serious quarantines did work (some European regions that heavily quarantined individuals and banned outsiders for a while faced the black death much better, think Milan was one of them)

The 1918 Spanish flu epidemic was made much much worse due to government's lying about the disease for PR reasons (Spain was much more honest in its reporting, hence the name, Spanish flu). People in Philadelphia particularly paid for their government's stupidity, as a parade was held, that caused many to be infected, because the government refused to let people know the truth about the deadly virus pillaging their community. Elsewhere millions died because governments lied, which is supported by academic sources, and not just conspiracy nonsense.

I don't think people realize how badly everything is faked there, even if it is obvious. They still do it.  There's no concept of being caught in the future, they just do it and deal with it later. It's a terrible mentality.

Heck, there was a Chinese official blatantly lying by saying ""Chinese people enjoy freedom of speech, look at then having lively discussions on social media."" No crap, that's because there are so many people discussing it that the censorship can no longer keep up.

Some other examples I've seen include scammers I have met while in China. Trying to get me to get on a taxi for 120RMB per person when I was aware and told him it should cost no more than 20RMB for the whole group because we've taken taxis before. China claims to be leading the world with green energy when it built fake wind turbines that were actually giant fans using energy to spin and give the illusion they were wind turbines instead of generating energy; they broke down and were never repaired. China even recently lied about its coronavirus hospital. People were watching it on livestream when Chinese media published something that used stock photos from online claiming the hospital was done with people watching the stream could literally verify the fake news, as the photos did not even resemble the actual thing.

They just do it. 能骗就骗  is a very pervasive attitude in the mainland. It's very foreign and strange to westerners because it doesn't make sense. But that's just how it is. They don't think of the consequences because if they can get away with it, they benefit. If there's a problem, just ignore it.

That's because of the way laws are essentially never enforced consistently. People know they can get away if they break certain laws unless there are certain cues telling them the law will be enforced, like if an official is announcing his visit to the city.

As a mysterious virus spread through Wuhan last month, the World Health Organization had a message: China has got this.

And as the coronavirus swept across the Chinese heartland and jumped to other nations, WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, applauded the “transparency” of the Chinese response.

Even as evidence mounted that Chinese officials had silenced whistleblowers and undercounted cases, Tedros took a moment to extol the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Now — more than a month into an escalating global health crisis — there are questions about whether the WHO’s praise in the early weeks created a false sense of security that potentially spurred the virus’s spread.

“We were deceived,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University who also provides technical assistance to WHO.

“Myself and other public health experts, based on what the World Health Organization and China were saying, reassured the public that this was not serious, that we could bring this under control,” he continued.

“We were,” he added, “giving a false sense of assurance.”

Managing the outbreak of a new infection is never easy. In times of crisis, WHO — a U.N. agency based in Geneva — must work with member countries to get information and coordinate a response.

Experts familiar with the workings of WHO, including current and former advisers, stressed that careful diplomacy and public praise can keep countries in crisis from shutting out the world.

The agency learned valuable lessons from the 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which China initially tried to coverup. The agency is doing much right this time around, some experts said.

But some fear that WHO’s embrace of China’s numbers and assessments in the early stages of this outbreak, as well as its ongoing praise for the country’s response, are testing the agency’s global credibility right when it needs it most.

“I’m concerned about whether they can actually assume leadership effectively in terms of the international response,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.

“People trust the organization to be the guardian of global health because it is politically neutral and has expertise.”

How SARS changed responses
The SARS epidemic shook China and changed the way WHO responds to threats.

In the aftermath of the crisis, updated rules required WHO to report emerging diseases and gave it broader power to investigate threats using nonstate sources of information such as civil society groups.

One of the goals: preventing coverups.

In late December, rumors of a mysterious virus started circulating on Chinese social media. China notified WHO on Dec. 31 that there was a pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan. Based on Chinese data, WHO issued a Jan. 5 statement saying there were 44 cases and no evidence of person-to-person transmission.

But a Washington Post reconstruction of events showed that by Jan. 5, some Wuhan authorities knew that doctors were discussing the spread of a SARS-like virus. For this, they were detained and denounced.

It also found that local officials undercounted cases.
“My sense is there was delay in getting information from Wuhan to Beijing, even as Beijing was relatively open about sharing with WHO,” said Mara Pillinger, an associate in global health policy and governance at Georgetown’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.

David Heymann, a professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and current chair of WHO’s advisory committee on infectious hazards defended the response.

“It is very difficult in the beginning of an outbreak to understand the potential,” he said, pointing to U.S. failures in the early days of the AIDS crisis and Canada’s struggle to coordinate provincial and federal authorities during SARS.

Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said WHO was doing a good job under tough conditions.

But she noted that critical epidemiological data that researchers use to understand a virus — information about who got sick, when — was slow to get out from China.

“One criticism that we should direct at WHO is that when it puts out situation reports, they are basically missing data from China,” she said.

“It’s fair to ask, ‘If you don’t have data, why not? And what are you doing about it?”

WHO's defense of China

In late January, China moved from denial to drastic action.

On Jan. 20, with 400 million people about to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday, officials confirmed what many had long suspected: the virus could spread person to person.

President Xi called for swift, transparent action. “It is necessary to release epidemic information in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation,” according to state media reports.

Authorities started to seal off Wuhan, a city of 11 million, canceling some flights, trains and suspending public transportation.

In Geneva, an emergency panel convened to discuss the situation and decide whether to declare a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, which signals “serious, unusual or unexpected” health crisis “that poses a public health risk to other countries through international spread.”

On Jan. 22, Tedros applauded China’s recent efforts. “What they are doing is a very, very strong measure and with full commitment,” he said

The comment surprised public health experts because travel bans can create panic and make things harder for first responders.

On Jan. 23, China announced it was expanded the quarantine to other cities — and millions more people.

Later the same day, in Geneva, WHO decided against declaring a PHEIC. That meant, among other things, no calls for restrictions on travel in and out of China, even as Beijing locked down the Chinese heartland.

Asked about China’s quarantine, Tedros demurred.

“At end of the day, a sovereign country has the autonomy to do what it thinks is right,” he said, adding that he hoped it would be short.

In China, officials were increasingly talking about what went wrong. In a Jan. 27 interview, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted that information should have been released more quickly.

But in visit to Beijing, Tedros commended officials. The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that Tedros lauded not only the Corona response, but the very effectiveness of “China’s system.”

On his return from Beijing, he heaped compliments on China and its president.

“I was very encouraged and impressed by the president’s detailed knowledge of the outbreak and his personal involvement in the outbreak,” he said. “This was for me a very rare leadership.”

On Jan. 30 WHO declared a PHEIC, finally acknowledging the risk the Wuhan outbreak posed to other countries. “The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak,” Tedros said, adding that China is setting “a new standard” for outbreak response.

WHO's 'tricky balancing act'

Some experts have defended the comments as sound strategy.

“WHO has really tricky balancing act,” said Devi Sridhar a public health expert at the University of Edinburgh. “If that means praising China publicly, that’s what he has to do.”

Others worried that it could shake faith in the U.N. body.

Praising China’s leaders “is not a bad idea, but do you want to do it in a professional and credible way,” said the Council on Foreign Relations’ Huang.

For now, WHO seems to be sticking with the strategy.

At a new conference on Thursday, Tedros was asked, again, about China, including the death of one of the Chinese doctors who sounded the alarm on the virus, only to be detained by police. (He later died of the virus.)

He first deferred to a colleague, then took the chance to speak again, defending China’s handling of the epidemic. “It is very difficult, given the facts,” he said, “to say that China was hiding.”"

>From sampling to testing, the device is apparently able to detect the novel coronavirus in just 40 minutes. In comparison, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology that is currently in use can take between 1.5 to 3 hours.

>The device draws on the latest microfluidic chip technology from Shenzhen Shineway Hi-Tech Co. Ltd.

>PCR technology is reliant on the speed at which temperature rises for the extraction of viral RNA from amplified DNA fragments. So the team led by Wen Weijia, a professor at HKUST’s Department of Physics, developed a novel silicon-based micro-heater module that can perform that function faster than the semiconductors in conventional large-scale PCR devices.

>“The key to getting the diagnostic results in merely 40 minutes lies in a novel material that we developed. It is a silicon-based micro-heater that has superb thermal conductivity. Compared to the conventional PCR technology, our micro-heater can speed up temperature rises, which can significantly shorten the time needed for diagnosis,” Gao, the CEO of Shineway Tech, told BioWorld.

>The micro-heater could speed up temperature rises to around 30 degrees Celsius per second from an average of 4-5 C per second in conventional PCR devices, reducing the detection time of the device.
“Among all the quantitative real-time PCR tests available on the market, ours should be the fastest,” said Gao.

>The detection device uses standard rapid testing tools, not unlike those used for influenza. A quick screen and a sample is taken from the nasal cavity, which is then put into the analyzer for testing.


>The new device is already in use by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, while two more sets are being delivered to the CDCP in Hubei and Nansha.
Each device is packed with a microfluidic portable PCR analyzer, a pre-processing instrument, a bioassay chip and the novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection kits. It can test up to eight samples at the same time."

Let's see, Mad King Donald lies about everything, everybody knows, nobody cares, and then jump on the one thing he trumpets, how good the economy is. That one thing, the Rupert Murdoch zombies feast on. Why would he not lie about that? This is an idiot that had 6 corporate bankruptcies and he thought that was 'making money'. He thought forming a fraud veterans charity to use as a family slush fund was 'good business'.    
  
What is going on now is the 'middle class tax cut' the Republicans shoved through 2 years ago has allowed corporations to end up paying zero taxes, and often getting big tax credits for 'investment'. The zero response to the Panama Papers was the green flag that the (Republican) US government is OK with that. Meanwhile, that loss of revenue is translating to the US National Debt, adding $1 Trillion last year, and projected $1.3 Trillion this year. The economic conditions are different from the Weimar Republic. That was massive inflation, where it would take a wheelbarrow of Deutschemark to buy a loaf of bread. It got to the point that $10 Million Deutschemark notes were only printed on one side, to save printing costs. That was what started the German Workers Party.  
  
What is going on now is far worse. The largest most industrial nations have started floating on deep debt. Japan has twice the National Debt of their annual GDP. The US National Debt is now several trillion above the annual GDP (20 Trillion GDP, 23 Trillion National Debt). The real kicker here, is China has been fueling all their expansion by increasing their National Debt, now over 3 times their GDP. GDP only stays high and increasing if the consumer is busy and spending. When consumer spending stops, the GDP plummets.

Just want to vent a bit my thoughts,

It""s  getting more and more difficult to believe any happy ending of the  epidemic. There are now too much indicator to me that this is going to  go full global catastrophic. Here is how i process :

\-It  already happened 100 years ago, when the world was less connected and  less populated. An H1N1 strain killed 5% of the world population then  mutated in less lethal form maybe to survive because of lack of living  host. It killed mostly healthy and young men.

\-An official 2 % mortality rate is already really high.

\-Chinese  government are know for covering everything that don't suit them.  Provinces are quarantined, hospitals are crowded, sick people have  nowhere to go and dies at home, army is deployed and some internet  source says lot of dead bodies are burned and erased from statistics. 2%  or 700 dead at this time seems really a small odd number to me.

\-It  is heavily contagious.  Like if someone have it and just take an  elevator, the next people will have it. If someone have it and cough,  the infectious airborne droplets will evaporate only to left a  crystallized viral particle that can travel in the dry air for hours.  This is plague level contagiousness.

\-TV  News are not or little talking about it. Strange. Usually they always  seeks for selling you fear, and they have a potential deadly virus with  evil Chinese coverup, they just have to pick one of those Chinese video  on social medias. But not this time. Why ? Do they know something we  shouldn't ? Is the goal is to prevent panic in population ? Have they  guidelines from governments ? This make me think something big is  hidden.

\-People around me are  unaware of the situation. Like very unaware. My lovely gf is a nurse,  but she get annoyed every time i talk about the CoronaVirus. Like it is  just one more flu to her, and it can't hit us because life is always  more easy to us Europeans. I had to explain to her why 50 millions  people in quarantine is concerning. She now understand and play the  game.  I struggle to find in real humans how feel concerned. I stocked  some food and water in case things go bad.

\-People  in my country do not have the discipline of Chinese people. Here, citizen are king. I don't want to see what a quarantined city will look  like here. I still hope Im wrong and all will be ok soon."

China has been heavily struck by various outbreaks over the years. Whenever there's an outbreak somewhere, China usually has it bad. SARS and the Wuhan novel coronavirus obviously originated from China, but besides that, China was also severely effected by a swine flu not long ago that wiped out their pork supplies. Not long before that, they also took a serious hit from MERS. Numerous avian flus also spread like wildfire in China throughout the past two decades. Taiwan managed to keep out MERS and the recent swine flu. The fact of the matter is large, densely populated areas with poor sanitation like China are prone to such outbreaks, and they will occur on a regular basis unless China goes through drastic changes. Taiwan is indeed smart to not completely depend on China for it's economy, doing so would be ill advised regardless which country you are. Having your economy collapse because your one and only trade partner rolls out with an epidemic every now and then is needless to say, stupid and shortsighted."

We already knew this. But the magnitude of that problem is still shocking. So before Wuhan is even quarantined, coronavirus spreads among people on a business conference in Singapore.

I think it should be clear that looking at number of confirmed cases is completely ridiculous at this point. There are dozens maybe hundreds of undetected 2019-nCoV cases in other countries - most of them with likely mild symptoms that continue with their everyday lives and spread the virus.

I think its fair to say that a zoonotic origin is the most likely case.  Why?  Well because we know that these SL-CoV's exist in the local bat population (and possibly other animals).  We know that these bats (and other animals) are consumed at the market in Wuhan.  We've seen similar coronaviruses come from bats.  So its likely this is another, more virulent, example of an animal-borne coronavirus. 

The fact that the BSL4 lab is in Wuhan is something that needs to be considered.  There have been examples of pathogens that have escaped from various BSL4 labs across the world.  So its possible a researcher accidentally got infected and that's where this started.  But thats still a rather unlikely scenario due to the extreme measures taken in these labs to ensure no contamination takes place.  Even more unlikely is the idea that this is state-sponsored bioterrorism.  There is no evidence that suggests the latter two possibilities could be true.  The study that showed HIV inserts into the viral genome was debunked.  The virus shares close to 80% of its genome with SARS.  So with that, we have to go with the highest probability and that is that its zoonotic in origin."

1. We know that the lab was working on bat based coronaviruses from both job advertisement and published work. Link for job listing : http://www.whiov.cas.cn/105341/201911/t20191118_5438006.html .

2. A report published in the medical journal The Lancet found that of 41 cases of the virus in Wuhan, China, only 13 were linked to the market. The researchers also found that the first hospitalized case was not linked to the market. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/wuhan-seafood-market-may-not-be-source-novel-virus-spreading-globally
      
3. As seen in this excerpt from the WHO document - 'SARS How a global epidemic was stopped' - we know that there have been previous incidents were coronavirus have escaped the lab in China. screenshot of page : https://m.imgur.com/a/kKinpb0 Full doc : https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/207501/9290612134_eng.pdf%3Fsequence%3D1%26isAllowed%3Dy&ved=2ahUKEwik_P6_x6vnAhW8RhUIHabrDMcQFjAFegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw2RLZfNhnzkiygtN5N_pO7u
     
4. The lab is 8.5 miles from the claimed epicenter. http://lssf.cas.cn/en/facilities-view.jsp?id=ff8080814ff56599014ff59e677e003d
     
To conclude we know that the lab in Wuhan studies bat coronaviruses, has had previous leaks, and is very close to the epicenter. WHO literally have said a lab leak is a likely source in the doc I linked. No country is going to volunteer that they were responsible for a leak that has caused a global spread of a virus. The lab theory is a very strong possibility."

IMO, immigration is a major factor driving up Canadian housing prices (in addition to low interest rates):

1. [The federal government's targets for immigration in 2020 and 2021 are 341,000 and 350,000 respectively](https://www.cicnews.com/2019/12/canadian-immigration-in-2020-expect-a-big-year-for-provincial-and-regional-immigration-programs-1213412.html#gs.vuqmn2). Most of them will likely go to either Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa or Montreal (and their surrounding areas).
2. Canada has a merit-based immigration system, so many of these new arrivals will come to Canada with both money, education and skills. Many will find good paying jobs almost immediately (particularly in the IT sector if they're immigrating to Toronto). You'll be competing with these folks for housing.
3. Here's a great article from Bloomberg about this entitled ""[*Immigrants Are Burning Canada Short Sellers - Attracting talent from around the world has helped prevent the country from suffering lasting economic harm.*](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-22/immigrants-are-burning-canada-short-sellers)"" 

&#x200B;

>Under what conditions might we expect to see housing prices drop significantly?

1. A lengthy moratorium on immigration (let's say 10 - 15 years). This is of course extremely unlikely irrespective of which political party comes to power federally.
2. An increase in the prime lending rate to ""normal levels"", i.e., 5% and above. Again, extremely unlikely - this would be economic suicide given the current levels of indebtedness in Canada.

The coronavirus epidemic in China is an interesting scenario, because it can impact Canadian real estate in one of two ways:

1. It could expedite capital outflow  from China and into Canadian real estate as the rich and politically-connected rush to leave China for health reasons. 
2. Or, it will have a negative impact on Canadian real estate if the CCP is serious about quarantining ***everyone*** (rich or poor, politically-connected or not) thus preventing money and people from coming to Canada."

YOU are the one spreading misinformation as we already hashed out elsewhere.YOU are the one who is DANGEROUS as you consistently are advocating that people do NOT take airborne precautions despite EVERY single agency responding to nCoV being told to respond as if Airborne, this from hospitals to the military .YOU, Who cherry pick articles that are NOT accepted standards as a source for your definition that NO ONE USES.

BY DEFINITION, Droplets and Aeresolized are BOTH forms of AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION

**Definition of airborne pathogen via ANY medical dictionary.**

""Airborne Pathogen -  any disease-causing organism which can be transmitted through the air."" (PERIOD)

Aeresolized Falls under the classification of airborne.

The virus is and has been airborne like EVERY OTHER COV including the common cold.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

"" An **airborne disease** is any disease that is caused by [pathogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) that can be transmitted through the air. ""

"" Airborne disease is transmitted as both small, dry particles, **and** as larger liquid droplets.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_disease#cite_note-4) ""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne\_disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_disease)

**Per your same NIOSH study**"" ‘Aerosols’ would also include ‘droplet nuclei’ which are small particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less, **typically produced through the process of rapid desiccation of exhaled respiratory droplets** \[[5](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3707-y#ref-CR5), [6](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3707-y#ref-CR6)\]. However, in some situations, such as where there are strong ambient air cross-flows, for example, l**arger droplets can behave like aerosols** with the potential to transmit infection via this route (see next section below). ""

and"" Several authors lump together transmission by **either large droplets or aerosol-sized particles as “airborne transmission**” ""

Note they state "" However, **we think** that it is important to maintain a distinction between particles of < 10 μm and larger particles ""

You present a paper that states it might be a good idea to have a distinction of types of airborne transmission as being THE DEFINITION of airborne, without either reading or noting that this is a suggestion and NOT THE STANDARD DEFINITION ACCEPTED BY THE ENTIRE WORLD currently (since you like to shout, Ill meet you in your world)

NOW how this relates to the current outbreak:nCoV is being considered as extremely similar to SARS albeit more transmissible and showing faster spread (wonder why)

YOUR paper even notes that "" For SARS-CoV, several thorough epidemiological studies that include retrospective airflow tracer investigations are **consistent with the hypothesis of an airborne transmission route** "" Even under its Not universally accepted definition of airborne.

So. I present several standards used the world over noting that droplets are considered airborn YOU present a paper that asks if maybe we should reclassify this world standard as being the world standard.

Every agency is responding to nCoV as an airborne disease, Every other Coronavirus studied is considered Airborne, This Corona Virus is spread through the air and thus is Airborne.  


"" isolate the [PUI for 2019-nCoV](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html) in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR), if available.""  


 [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control.html) 

Your constant DENIALISM and attempts to down play this are dangerous as they cause people to under prepare and not take proper precautions and thus potentially SPREAD THE DISEASE FURTHER.

YOU will be responsible for the Dead should this spread to those who read your dangerous posts and don't take proper precautions.

[Wuhan pneumonia: China confirms New Coronavirus transmission via aerosol through air](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-51427216)

>China's official health department confirmed on Saturday (February 8) that the new coronavirus can be transmitted through the air.

>At a press conference held in Shanghai, health and epidemic prevention experts confirmed that in addition to direct transmission and contact transmission, the transmission route of New Coronary Pneumonia also includes ""aerosol transmission"".

>Aerosol is a colloidal dispersion system formed by solid or liquid small particles dispersed and suspended in a gaseous medium. In simple terms, aerosols are small liquid or solid particles that are stably dispersed and suspended in the air and cannot be seen by the naked eye.

>The so-called ""aerosol transmission"" means that the droplets are mixed in the air to form an ""aerosol"", which causes infection after inhalation.

    
>Previously, on February 5, the National Health and Medical Commission's website published the ""Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition)"". To be determined "".

>After an interval of 3 days, the aerosol transmission route was confirmed by the official Chinese health department.

>**The difference between aerosol and droplet transmission is the distance of transmission. Both droplets and contact infections occur within close range, while aerosols travel long distances, increasing the risk of contactless infection.**

>Aerosol infection

>The Chinese Lunar New Year's Lantern Festival, the health department warned that the virus is very spread among family members.

>The Shanghai Health Department announced on February 8 that only 8 days and a half days, 5 new cases were confirmed, of which 2 were from overseas and 3 were residents of Shanghai. The total number of confirmed cases was 286.

>Zeng Qun, deputy director of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, said at a press conference that the community is urged to pay attention to the prevention of clustered epidemics and to increase the awareness of family clustered epidemic prevention. The home epidemic prevention measures include:

 >We must cancel all social gatherings and discourage relatives and friends in key epidemic areas from postponing their plans to Shanghai;
    
*Normally open windows and more ventilation to maintain indoor air circulation;

    *Do daily household disinfection: wipe key points such as door handles, tables, chairs, and toilet seat cushions with 75% ethanol or chlorine-containing disinfectant;

    *Personal hygiene: Wash your hands with running water, soap or hand sanitizer before and after meals. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or elbow flexion when coughing or sneezing;

    *Avoid air and contact transmission: Family members should avoid contact with body secretions of people with suspicious symptoms, and do not share personal daily necessities; during meals, chopsticks are divided into meals, eat fast, talk less, communicate with each other, avoid handshake and hugs, smile with hands etiquette. 

>Epidemic prevention experts also recommend that, as a precautionary measure, remember to put a toilet lid on the toilet before flushing it out of the suspected patient at home, which can greatly reduce the concentration of aerosols in the air.

>After the spread of the Wuhan epidemic led to the Chinese authorities ’decision to block the city on January 23 to prevent epidemics, traffic in Wuhan, Hubei and surrounding provinces was severely affected. Airlines from multiple countries have suspended flights to and from Wuhan.

>Wuhan, known as the ""nine provinces' thoroughfare"", is not only a transportation hub in China, but also a major industrial town in China. There are no statistics on the economic impact of the closure of Wuhan.

>As Shanghai, the economic center of eastern China, if the epidemic is out of control, the impact on China and the world economy will be immeasurable.

>Hong Kong isolation measures

>The pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus spreading from Wuhan has still not shown signs of abating. Epidemic prevention measures in many countries and regions in the world are also tightening.
    

>From Saturday (8th) in Hong Kong, all people entering Hong Kong from mainland China, including Hong Kong residents and foreign visitors, must be quarantined for 14 days: at home, in a hotel room or in a government isolation center.

>A total of 26 confirmed cases from Hong Kong to Friday. The strike by medical staff in Hong Kong, which began on February 3, was also suspended on Saturday.

>From January 30 to February 4, the Hong Kong government closed 10 entry and exit ports with mainland China. In response to the recent tide of people buying food and household goods in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government stated that the epidemic prevention and control measures will not affect the mainland and Hong Kong's freight traffic, and there is sufficient food supply.
Outbreak

>As of February 7, more than 30,000 people have been diagnosed with infection in China, and the death toll has exceeded 700.

Before I re-post some of the troubling leaks from China, let's focus on the facts:

1. R0 of 2.7-4.1.  This is more contagious than the 1918 Spanish flu.
2. 2-14 day contagious asymptomatic period *plus* another 1-2 weeks of infection and post infection spreading.  The flu has a 4 day asymptomatic period.
3. Leaks  indicate that there's roughly a 25% rate of needing hospitalization or  death.  Even the official numbers represent a similar figure:  20%  either dead or in serious condition.
4. Cytokine  Storm, bloody pneumonia, high rates of death even in young and healthy  individuals- multiple organ failure.   Without hospitalization the  evidence seems to indicate high rates of fatality.
5. No cure, just hope you have oxygen and IV fluids.
6. Virus could live on surfaces for at least several days
7. Virus  spread from droplets, vomit, feces, and bodily fluids - cannot touch  the dead, cremation or mass burials is the only option.
8. China's  quarantine of 100+ million people, and the utter shutdown of its  economy is unprecedented and has never happened before.    Nearly 90% of  China's economy is on standstill.
9. Thousands  of flights continue to come and go - flights haven't stopped.  Hundreds  of cruise ships continue unabated on a global scale.

One could say we’re both wrong and right at the same time depending on droplet size and whether it’s still contagious once aerosolized, but it’s fair to say that, being cautious, anyone in a high risk environment should be wearing an N95 mask. Otherwise, regular contact/droplet protection surgical type masks should still offer significant protection. Good luck quantifying that risk differential, but in general, I don’t see a need for everyone to walk around wearing an N95 in public - yet?  

[This super-nerdy CDC guy with a tactical quarantine vest on ](https://www.kcra.com/article/5-quarantined-travis-afb-show-symptoms-of-coronavirus-cdc-says/30817842) says no need for masks in public in the US, and standing 6’ away is all that’s needed to avoid transmission. I would be more cautious than that, as other coronavirus was have been shown to remain viable on surfaces for weeks!

In my opinion, anyone who either knows they have, or can’t afford to catch a respiratory infection should be wearing a regular mask in public anyway. Germ etiquette is sorely lacking in the US, regardless of 2019-nCoV prevalence. I’d say N95’s for *everyone* if it really starts to spread in your area."

Despite glittery cities like Shanghai and Beijing, China is not a first-world country. Particularly once you get away from the pacific coast, the level of development often more closely resembles Africa or Latin America than the US or Europe. The crisis hospitals it has been setting up are woefully bad by western standards. 

Consider this: in the eighties, there was a tiny outbreak of Ebola in Germany. It only infected a handful of people, and I don’t believe any of them actually died. This is because *Germany is not West Africa.*

Key Diagnostic Test Might Be Missing Many Coronavirus Cases

By Liu Denghui, Huang Shulun and Matthew Walsh

China’s ability to control a rapidly spreading coronavirus epidemic is under further strain amid fears that a key test used to confirm new cases is failing to catch large numbers of people with the disease.
Problems with so-called nucleic acid tests (NATs) widely used to identify the presence of the previously unknown pneumonia-causing virus make it likely that many infections are going uncounted even as the number of confirmed cases continues to spiral.
Authorities are still struggling to ascertain the true extent of the epidemic, which had infected (link in Chinese) 34,598 people and killed 723 in China as of Friday, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). In Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak, reports of overwhelmed hospitals, scarce medical supplies, and overly stringent diagnostic criteria have complicated efforts to determine the scope of the disease.
￼
Health officials have recommended cheap, abundant, and generally accurate NATs as one of two main methods to confirm the presence of the coronavirus in humans. The technique involves collecting samples from patients and testing them for specific kinds of molecules that appear in the genetic material of the new coronavirus. If those molecules are present in the sample, the patient is isolated for treatment.
But there is growing concern that those NATs are producing large numbers of false negatives. In a Wednesday interview with state broadcaster CCTV, Wang Chen, an expert in critical diseases and director of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said one characteristic of the virus was that “not all of those infected by it return positive NATs.”
“Even patients who definitely have the disease only come back positive 30% to 50% of the time,” Wang said. “Testing throat swabs (from potentially infected people) also returns a lot of false negatives.”
Tests like NATs are especially important in people that may have contracted the virus but have not yet shown symptoms. Emerging trends in local infections mean that many such patients may have been sent home by hospitals after their NATs came back negative, doctors told Caixin.
“At the moment, more and more cases in Wuhan are flaring up collectively in family groups, and the majority are of the concealed onset type,” said Zhang Xiaochun, a deputy director of the medical imaging department at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, one of the institutions at the center of the outbreak. “They may have undergone one or even several NATs and shown no clinical symptoms, but keeping them under observation at home is bound to spread the disease further.”
A doctor in the imaging department of another major Wuhan hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Caixin said that previously some patients whose CT scans clearly showed signs of viral infection but whose NATs tested negative were “released” back into their communities due to a shortage of hospital berths.
NATs are by nature an imperfect mechanism for determining the presence of a given organism. For instance, because the genetic material they test for usually only exists in tiny amounts, many NATs include a step called amplification, which makes many copies of it. A shortcoming of amplification is that it also copies any contaminating DNA in the sample, potentially causing misleading results.
“All experienced doctors know that NATs contain flaws,” the doctor told Caixin.
Aside from NATs, health officials have also recommended the use of gene sequencing to confirm coronavirus infections.
But that method has its own problems. Although gene sequencing is comparatively accurate, it is also expensive, and not all affected hospitals have the necessary facilities. Additionally, at the start of the outbreak, many hospitals had to gain permission from higher authorities to conduct such tests, a rule that has since been relaxed.
Experts have previously called for the inclusion of CT scanning as a key basis for diagnosing coronavirus infections, as well as rapid hospital admission and isolation.
In response to calls from medical professionals on the frontlines of the epidemic, the NHC on Tuesday relaxed the clinical criteria for reporting suspected coronavirus cases, with extra leeway granted to people in Hubei.
Outside the stricken province, medical professionals should now suspect coronavirus infection in patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia, fever and/or breathing problems, and a low-to-normal white blood cell count or a low lymphocyte count. Within Hubei, only two of the three criteria are required.
China added more than 3,000 new coronavirus cases each day from Monday through Friday, with the vast majority occurring in Hubei, according to NHC figures.

Few hot takes

The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were depressed total lymphocytes, prolonged pro- thrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Com- pared with non-ICU patients, patients who received ICU care had numerous laboratory abnormalities. These abnormali- ties suggest that 2019-nCoV infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocar- dia injury, hepatic injury, and kidney injury. These laboratory abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in pa- tients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection.

The dynamic profile of laboratory findings was tracked in 33 patients with NCIP (5 nonsurvivors and 28 survivors). In the nonsurvivors, the neutrophil count, D-dimer, blood urea, and creatinine levels continued to increase, and the lymphocyte counts continued to decrease until death occurred. Neutro- philia may be related to cytokine storm induced by virus in- vasion, coagulation activation could have been related to sus- tained inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury could have been related to direct effects of the virus, hypoxia, and shock. The 3 pathologic mechanisms may be associated with the death of patients with NCIP.

Until now, no specific treatment has been recommended for coronavirus infection except for meticulous supportive care.17 Currently, the approach to this disease is to control the source of infection; use of personal protection precaution to reduce the risk of transmission; and early diagnosis, isolation, and supportive treatments for affected patients. Antibacterial agents are ineffective. In addition, no anti- viral agents have been found to provide benefit for treating SARS and MERS. All of the patients in this study received antibacterial agents, 90% received antiviral therapy, and 45% received methylprednisolone. The dose of oseltamivir and methylprednisolone varied depending on disease severity. However, no effective outcomes were observed.

This study has several limitations."

THIS POST IS DANGEROUSLY WRONG AND HAS BEEN PROVEN SO ELSEWHERE ALREADY.

YOU are the one spreading misinformation as we already hashed out [elsewhere.YOU](https://elsewhere.YOU) are the one who is DANGEROUS as you consistently are advocating that people do NOT take airborne precautions despite EVERY single agency responding to nCoV being told to respond as if Airborne, this from hospitals to the military .YOU, Who cherry pick articles that are NOT accepted standards as a source for your definition that NO ONE USES.

BY DEFINITION, Droplets and Aeresolized are BOTH forms of AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION

Definition of airborne pathogen via ANY medical dictionary.

""Airborne Pathogen - any disease-causing organism which can be transmitted through the air."" (PERIOD)

Aeresolized Falls under the classification of airborne.

The virus is and has been airborne like EVERY OTHER COV including the common cold.

\*Collins Dictionary of Biology, 3rd ed. © W. G. Hale, V. A. Saunders, J. P. Margham 2005

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

"" An airborne disease is any disease that is caused by pathogens that can be transmitted through the air. ""

"" Airborne disease is transmitted as both small, dry particles, and as larger liquid droplets.\[4\] ""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne\_disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_disease)

Per your same NIOSH study"" ‘Aerosols’ would also include ‘droplet nuclei’ which are small particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less, typically produced through the process of rapid desiccation of exhaled respiratory droplets \[5, 6\]. However, in some situations, such as where there are strong ambient air cross-flows, for example, larger droplets can behave like aerosols with the potential to transmit infection via this route (see next section below). ""

and"" Several authors lump together transmission by either large droplets or aerosol-sized particles as “airborne transmission” ""

Note they state "" However, we think that it is important to maintain a distinction between particles of < 10 μm and larger particles ""

You present a paper that states it might be a good idea to have a distinction of types of airborne transmission as being THE DEFINITION of airborne, without either reading or noting that this is a suggestion and NOT THE STANDARD DEFINITION ACCEPTED BY THE ENTIRE WORLD currently (since you like to shout, Ill meet you in your world)

NOW how this relates to the current outbreak:nCoV is being considered as extremely similar to SARS albeit more transmissible and showing faster spread (wonder why)

YOUR paper even notes that "" For SARS-CoV, several thorough epidemiological studies that include retrospective airflow tracer investigations are consistent with the hypothesis of an airborne transmission route "" Even under its Not universally accepted definition of airborne.

So. I present several standards used the world over noting that droplets are considered airborn YOU present a paper that asks if maybe we should reclassify this world standard as being the world standard.

Every agency is responding to nCoV as an airborne disease, Every other Coronavirus studied is considered Airborne, This Corona Virus is spread through the air and thus is Airborne.

"" isolate the PUI for 2019-nCoV in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR), if available.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control.html)

Your constant DENIALISM and attempts to down play this are dangerous as they cause people to under prepare and not take proper precautions and thus potentially SPREAD THE DISEASE FURTHER.

YOU will be responsible for the Dead should this spread to those who read your dangerous posts and don't take proper precautions.

Airborne infection

📷

&#x200B;

Direct spread of pathogens via aerosols. The droplets, which have a diameter of 100 µm to 2 mm, are aerosolised through sneezing, speaking or coughing. As these droplets cannot float through the air for a longer time, they only pose a risk to contact persons at a distance of 1-2 metres to the patient. Airborne infection is a typical transmission path for influenza viruses and Streptococci.

[https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/02/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/02/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)

That's approximately 7,000 severe + dead cases for 34.6k total cases, with a disease where the deaths and complications are known to trail greatly behind in time. 20%+ of people in serious danger without medical intervention. That would be extraordinarily dangerous for an easily transmissible disease, worse than most experts think a more adapted bird flu would be.

It is much more reasonable that there are at least 3x more cases per time mark than China has officially confirmed, many are mild and ambulatory with symptoms they can manage, there were thousands of cases outside of Wuhan before it was locked down, and therefore nCoV can (and already has) spread much more widely without causing sudden clusters of severe illness that stand out.

Looking at the international figures like Singapore and Hong Kong and the United States case report, this does seem to be severe disease, generating severe cases with only 1-3 dozen cases per sample. Flu doesn't do that. But the disease as seen in China is clearly overblown, meaning that Chinese surveillance is poor and spread inside and outside China is greater."

We are at least a month in to the coronavirus epidemic, with 28,000 cases confirmed in China, at least 564 dead and another 24,000 cases suspected. Naturally, at some point, we all start to wonder whether or how we ought to be doing something to avoid this thing.

It was this thought, as much as any journalistic impulse, that took me along to a briefing on the virus held by Chatham House with David Heymann, the man who led the World Health Organisation’s response to the Sars outbreak, this week.

I began to take notes furiously – stymied only by a leaking pen that turned my fingers blue – before I realised that the bottom line was quite straightforward. They don’t know how fast it spreads, they don’t know exactly what can or can’t transmit it, they don’t know how deadly it is, they don’t know for sure how many people have it and they don’t know when they will know. They do know – or think they know – that it isn’t “aerosolised”, which is to say, it doesn’t spread by sneezing. This is good news, because sneeze droplets are apparently a very efficient way for a virus to get around.

As for my personal interest in precautions, I took on board four main points. Firstly, keep a couple of metres away from suspected cases. Secondly, face masks protect other people from you more than they protect you from the virus. Thirdly, surgical gloves do protect you, because we are most likely to pick up germs on our hands before transferring them to the face, where they get into mouths or eyes. Fourthly, on that note, wash your hands all the damn time and don’t, whatever you do, touch your face before washing. In fact, touch your face as little as possible.

“Fine,” I thought. “I can do that. Not touching my face? Simple.”

Before heading out, I popped into the ladies’ and caught sight of myself in the mirror. My face was streaked with blue ink.

“Well,” I thought. “That’s me done for.”

China's eye in the sky

In many parts of China, it is now illegal to go out without a face mask. This is less than ideal for a surveillance state policed by facial recognition cameras everywhere. Fortunately, there is still work for the police’s enforcement drones: chase down people not wearing masks.

Footage published by The Global Times shows a drone following an old lady around in Inner Mongolia. “Yes, auntie, this is the drone speaking to you,” says an echoing voice. “You shouldn’t walk about without wearing a mask.” Another shows a man on his own in the fields trying to get some manual work done. “Uncle, we are in unusual times. Why did you come outside without wearing a mask?” says the Wizard of Oz voice from the sky. “Isn’t it comfortable to stay at home with food and drink?”

Let’s just pray the food and drink outlast the virus.

I hope the American public lives up to the example set by Lisa Simpson

A tit deserves a tat. So it was that, at the end of Donald Trump’s chest-beating address about how Americans carved the greatest republic in the history of the universe out of the bare, savage rock of an empty frontier (uh, except for the Native Americans), House speaker Nancy Pelosi unsmilingly tore up her copy of the speech.

Tit duly followed tat. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo mocked Ms Pelosi by posting a picture of Lisa Simpson, the cartoon character, sobbing pathetically as she tore up her own patriotic speech in an episode aired back in 1991. With depressing predictability, the actress who voices Lisa then betrayed her own tit-ish qualities by declaring, in response: “F--- you, Pompeo, for co-opting my character.” A producer of The Simpsons joined the pile-on by demanding that Pompeo never “ever ever ever” again use the cartoon’s material.

Beyond the thought that the whole lot of them were an unbearable bunch of tits, my main annoyance was that Lisa, the girly swot of the cartoon that I watched avidly as a child and obviously the character to whom I most related, had been maligned again. She wasn’t sobbing out of frailty in that episode, as Mr Pompeo implied, but in anger, after witnessing a congressman taking a bribe. She soon gets the guy jailed for corruption because, unlike now, the Nineties were a time for idealism.

Mr Trump, on the other hand, was acquitted this week. Instead, it now falls to the American public to pass judgment on their president in the autumn, and I hope it is a harsh one. 

Unfortunately, judging by the front-runners of the first Democratic caucus this week, US voters have another truly unappetising choice ahead."

[Wuhan pneumonia: China confirms New Coronavirus transmission via aerosol through air](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-51427216)

>China's official health department confirmed on Saturday (February 8) that the new coronavirus can be transmitted through the air.

>At a press conference held in Shanghai, health and epidemic prevention experts confirmed that in addition to direct transmission and contact transmission, the transmission route of New Coronary Pneumonia also includes ""aerosol transmission"".

>Aerosol is a colloidal dispersion system formed by solid or liquid small particles dispersed and suspended in a gaseous medium. In simple terms, aerosols are small liquid or solid particles that are stably dispersed and suspended in the air and cannot be seen by the naked eye.

>The so-called ""aerosol transmission"" means that the droplets are mixed in the air to form an ""aerosol"", which causes infection after inhalation.

    
>Previously, on February 5, the National Health and Medical Commission's website published the ""Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition)"". To be determined "".

>After an interval of 3 days, the aerosol transmission route was confirmed by the official Chinese health department.

>**The difference between aerosol and droplet transmission is the distance of transmission. Both droplets and contact infections occur within close range, while aerosols travel long distances, increasing the risk of contactless infection.**

Its always going to be a question of risk tolerance. Today, that risk is still extremely low, and I think most people would agree, it is too soon. I'd look for a couple red flags:

* Multiple generations of virus spread in the US. Each link in the chain of infection should further undermine confidence in the containment efforts. 

* Are people getting isolated prior to showing symptoms. If so, contact tracing is proving effective. If not, it suggests containment is failing.

* Are people with no known exposure getting diagnosed?

* Are the numbers of those who caught in the US growing exponentially?

If you are serious about not getting it, you need to act before it is widespread in your area, but exactly when is still a hard call.

One other thought, I wouldn't blame you or anyone else for putting yourself first. But you should still consider: If containment fails, and we are to avoid a pretty severe breakdown in society, we will very much need supermarket workers to keep working through this. You are probably in the lowest risk age group, and thus, from a utilitarian perspective, you are one of the best people to still have working there. Even if that would mean you will most likely be exposed."

This is simply the result of the extremely unhygienic and barbaric food and sanitary practices of the Chinese people. Wet markets are common through Asia, with the exception of Japan, and there you will find both domestic and exotic aminals for sale. In these markets you will observe dead animals stored next to live ones and workers who butcher the animals directly in front of customers and passersby without any regard for proper food safety or handling. And all of this is on top of the existing unhygienic personal hygiene practices of Chinese people. 

This is the exact same environment that SARS came from and is responsible for the current epidemic. SARS was found to have originated from a species of bat and coronavirus, which is commonly found in animals but has never before seen a jump to humans (scientists have been aware of the existence of coronavirus since the 1960s) is almost certainly to have originated from the same environment. 

If anything, this is a clear cut case AGAINST globalism as it highlights the extreme differences in how cultures approach such basic things as food safety in the 21st century."

The way it stands in the US right now, how are they even diagnosing people without missing cases?  For example, Suppose someone goes to Medexpress, The ER, or other medical facility because they are sick.

From what I have been seeing, these facilities are downplaying all this and are probably likely to diagnose you with something else. As far as I'm concerned, asking you if you've recently been to China should not be the deciding factor. I can almost guarantee they are not testing everyone for this virus who shows symptoms.

Use the others and store them the same. That way you rotate them and coronavirus becomes non-infectious while they aren't used. Theoretically.

Usually coronavirus becomes non-infectious after a few hours outside a host, on surfaces, but there's been studies that showed that SARS was infectious for up to 5 days, with ideal conditions.

Also heat would help to get rid of the virus. If you can sit the storing box on a radiator it would help get rid of the coronavirus faster.

If you have a choice, use them only once. If you absolutely have no choice, then do it the way I described.

Also the more you use the masks, the better they become at filtering, as they slowly clog up. That makes for better filtering but the downside is that it takes more pressure to force air through them. As in you can use them as much as your lungs allow.

If you use them in a clean environment (as in not dusty as would be in a construction work zone), then they could last more days of use.

Again, this should be done if you absolutely know you risk exposure and can't find new masks.

Also remember that this procedure would get rid of coronavirus, not other pathogens that may still be in the mask."

Every case went to the clinic and got released, 3 or 4 days later went to clinic again, then 2 days after that was diagnosed.   It shows where these people went between when they were first misdiagnosed to confirmation.

In an interview with Caixin in Beijing last Sunday, American epidemiologist and respected “virus hunter” Walter Ian Lipkin said conversations with experts who visited the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the outbreak, led him to believe that the area’s subsequent decontamination had destroyed any remaining potential samples.

“There’s no way for anybody to do the research to figure out where (the virus) came from,” Lipkin said. “We don't have the information required to pinpoint it.”

Lipkin’s comments come as China continues to battle a rapidly spreading coronavirus epidemic that has so far killed at least 723 people and infected more than 34,000 worldwide.

The professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health has previously advised governments and the World Health Organization to help contain major disease outbreaks including SARS, MERS, Ebola, and West Nile virus.

“…this time is critical for the world, and (it’s important) that people come together and work together and care for one another. That’s why I’m here,” Lipkin said.

Many among the first group of patients were exposed to the virus at the market, which sold a number of wild animal varieties. Lipkin said the virus likely originated in a wild animal, citing the 2002-3 SARS epidemic, which was caused by a virus that originated in bats and spread to other species including civet cats before infecting humans.

The market was decontaminated shortly after local health authorities in Wuhan confirmed the outbreak in January. The move came before many researchers were able to collect sufficient environmental samples, [complicating efforts](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-05/in-depth-tracing-the-coronaviruss-origins-101511889.html) to determine the virus’s potential intermediate hosts.

Last month, [a paper](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20\)30183-5/fulltext) published in the British medical journal The Lancet disputed the claim that the market was the source of the outbreak, citing the case of the first known coronavirus patient, who had no links to the market.

However, Lipkin said it’s hard to establish a link between the testimony of the first known patient and the potential origin of the virus, because there may be even earlier cases that went undetected.

Lipkin has now returned to the U.S., where he will continue to investigate the virus’s modes of transmission and model its potential future spread. His team is focusing on tests that can determine gene sequences in animal specimens that strongly resemble those in the virus, he added.

Lipkin said his team is yet to develop a vaccine or other medication for the virus. But any potential vaccine would have to be carefully tested, preventing any kind of rapid rollout, he added.

Although the virus’s [fatality rate](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-06/questions-persist-over-coronavirus-fatality-rate-101512406.html) is likely lower than SARS, it will probably have a larger economic impact, Lipkin said.

“I don’t think the situation is going to end (soon). …Some people said on Feb. 6 that it was (virtually) over,” he said. “But I think that as we get into the warmer months, we will see less disease.”"

A Brazilian tourist coming from Chile activated the alarms in Bariloche (a tourist city in Patagonia) when he said that he had Coronavirus. Finally, after a series of rigorous exams and in complete isolation the man was diagnosed with pharingitis.

The man arrived friday afternoon from Chile, with a face mask on. After being asked by other tourists and bus station personnel the tourist said, without a doubt, ""I have coronavirus.""

Everything indicates he had been visiting the Puerto Montt and Osorno area and that he had crossed the Cardenal Samoré Pass, 42 kilometers from Villa La Angostura.

His declaration unleashed the fear of everyone in the establishment that receives around 4.000 tourists. Locale employees immeditately called an ambulance from the Ramon Carrillo hospital for his transfer, but the man didn't want to hear any reason and called a taxi to a hotel where he had already reserved a room, between the Gallardo and Rolando streets; in the centre of the city.

Towards the hotel an ambulance from the hospital and two patrol cars of the Rio Negro provincial police came to search for the man. The police interrupted all transit in the area while the man was contacted and rapidly transfered to the hospital in an important operative.

According to the reports, the hotel had been evacuated for a few hours until it was confirmed that the man did not have coronavirus.

Bariloche's hospital has in disposition a well-oiled isolation protocol for cases with an high posibility of contagion due to the experience that its professionals and institution adquired following the 2018-2019 Hantavirus outbreak in Epuyén.

The tourist was brought under question and the doctors detected since the beginning that his symptoms didn't correspond with the coronavirus that has already taken more than 700 lives in the world. The exams, which included blood samples, confirmed the suspictions and the man was diagnosed with pharingitis, according from hospital sources from El Cordillerano.

""The Bariloche Local Hospital and Fourth Sanitary Zone inform that, due to the rumours of the arrival on the city about a possible coronavirus case, professionals of the hospital contacted the person, realized the pertinent studies, dismissing the possibility of a suspect case,"" informs a release from the health centre.

Sources from the hospital informed Clarin that ""he was never hospitalized"" and that he was only subject to rigorous studies.

According to the international protocol, suspect cases of coronavirus include symptomps such as: ""Flu-like syndrome that generates muscle pain, fever, runny nose, sneezing, red eyes, fatigue, added with being in contact in the last 14 days with an infected person, in China in a wild meat market, specially in the city of Wuhan."" The Brazilian man did not meet any of these conditions, which resulted in his possible contagion being dismissed.

According to Clarin, the possible case rapidly reached the local population. Via WhatsApp, a message alerted the locals about avoiding the hospital, due to the possible contagion. ""Any urgency you have don't go to the hospital because today an old man, a French tourist, arrived in the terminal; saying that he had coronavirus symptoms. The police had to put in action the protocol to evacuate all of the terminal and now they have to evacuate the hotel that the old man was in, its total chaos,"" indicates the message that spread through Bariloche. The scare also spread through social media."

This explains why they were released from the healthcare facilities as they do not have the features of 2019-nCoV infection which healthcare professionals are looking out for.  

*Case 34 who visited GP clinics on 27 January and 1 February.  
*Case 35 who visited Bukit Merah Polyclinic on 31 January.  
*Case 36 who visited GP clinic on 1 February.  
*Case 37 who visited GP clinics on 1 and 3 February.  
*Case 40 who visited GP clinic on 30 January.  


The exceptions are...  
*Case 38 who visited Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic on 4 February.  
*Case 39 who visited GP clinics on 3 and 5 February.

In my opinion, the response by the Singapore's government was appropriate as they may not wish to overburden the healthcare system by sending all patients with flu symptoms for isolation. However, now that local transmissions have been confirmed, I do agree that a more aggressive approach should be taken."

On 7/2, at the plenary session of the Association of Intellectual Women, Center for Applied Science and Technology and Entrepreneurship, two scientists. Le Quang Hoa and TS. Nguyen Le Thu Ha announces that she has successfully studied the corona virus rapid test kit: RT-LAMP bio-product.

The RT-LAMP bio-product is a nucleic acid isothermal amplification technique specifically used to detect the RNA of pathogenic viruses.

If previously, to want to test cases of suspected coronavirus infection, Vietnam must apply the method of genetic sequencing in 3-5 days. Then, with the WHO test sample combined with the molecular biology test method, the test time was reduced to less than 9 hours.

“The usual RT-PCR reaction in the WHO test sample takes 240 minutes for the whole procedure. But with this research work, it will produce results only after 70 minutes ”, PhD. Draw share.

The advantages of RT - LAMP biological products are simple equipment, capable of being applied in the field, high sensitivity and specificity, etc. However, the development of biological products is quite complicated."""

No, the real number is much higher but that's because the CCP is grossly under-representing how many people are infected and have died for political reasons."

Coronavirus Can Survive 5 Days in Moderate Conditions, Expert Says

The Chinese team researching the novel coronavirus has learned more about the pathogen that has killed over 400 people and infected thousands worldwide.

Jiang Mengrong, a member of the expert team assembled by the National Health Commission, said during Monday’s press briefingthe team had discovered that the novel coronavirus can survive for up to five days in conditions of 20 degrees Celcius and 40% humidity.

Jiang reiterated that the coronavirus can be transmitted by touching infected surfaces such as door handles and elevator buttons. A test Monday of the door handle of an infectious patient’s room revealed 2019-nCoV nucleic acids, indicating the presence of the virus.

Qiu Haibo, another member of the team of experts, said there are several outcome scenarios for people with the virus. Those with robust immune systems may “self heal,” while other patients might develop upper respiratory problems without necessarily showing symptoms. Still others may experience only mild symptoms such as fever and fatigue.

“Only a small proportion of patients will end up in critical condition,” Qiu said."

The coronavirus death toll in China has risen to 811, surpassing the death toll from the SARS epidemic of 2002-3, according to official data released early Sunday.

The number of confirmed infections rose to 37,198, according to China’s National Health Commission. Eighty-nine deaths and 2,656 new cases were recorded in the preceding 24 hours, most of them in Hubei Province, the heart of the outbreak.

The SARS epidemic, which also began in China, killed 774 people worldwide.

Many doctors believe that deaths and infections from the current epidemic in China are undercounted because testing facilities at hospitals and laboratories are under severe strain.

The number of new cases confirmed in the country has stabilized in recent days, but World Health Organization officials cautioned against reading too much into those numbers, saying that Wuhan and Hubei Province were still in the midst of a “very intense outbreak.”
“It’s very, very early to make any predictions,” said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the W.H.O.’s health emergencies program. “This is still a very, very intense outbreak in Wuhan and Hubei.”

The measures put in place in Hubei appear to be “paying off,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general, but he warned that the course of outbreaks like these is unpredictable. “We have to understand it with caution because it can show stability for a few days and then they can shoot up,” he said. “I’ve said it many times, it’s slow now but it may accelerate.”


Dr. Tedros said the W.H.O. has identified a team of experts who will be traveling to China to provide assistance with the outbreak, and said the leader — whom he declined to identify — will depart for China on Monday or Tuesday, with the rest of the team following later."

So.... If this coronavirus also has short-lived antibodies that means it has potential to be a more common infection in the long tern.

Another thing to note is that even when people say oh this isn't as bad as the flu or this is only as bad as the flu They don't usually understand that they're implying this virus will become a permanent fixture of humanity and come back every year in a slightly mutated fashion but with extra short-lived antibodies.

everyone is looking at the threat of the first infection wave as if after that it's just going to end but If this turns into a wide scale outbreak in Asia it seems reasonable it'll be hard to ever get rid of the virus and it's got impressive enough viral characteristics that it ought to keep reinfecting people.

Humans have not developed natural immunity yet. The flu has been around forever. Humans have natural immunity to it. The fact still remains the same. The flu has a 0.1% mortality rate and current reports put the mortality rate of this coronavirus closer to the mortality rate of SARS. 

Here's my source:
 https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018952v1.full.pdf

If you're getting your information from the WHO, you should keep in mind that they are reporting exactly what the CCP are telling them which most experts agree is inaccurate. 

If you think the mortality rate is actually 2%, then you are admitting that as soon as someone is confirmed to have the virus, they immedietly die if they're one of the 2%. 

2% came from dividing the current number of deaths by the current number of infected. Literally everyone is overlooking the fact that it could take weeks for you to die after confirmation of infection.  If you want a more accurate mortality rate based on the Chinese numbers, divide the total number of today's deaths by the infection count from 10 days ago. That will give you a 9.4% mortality rate. 

Yes, it's true we don't have enough information to accurately determine the mortality rate but Jesus Christ we definitely have enough evidence to make a ball park figure and it's definitely closer to 6% than God damn ignorant 2%"

Few hot takes

>  The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in
this study were depressed total lymphocytes, prolonged pro-
thrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Com-
pared with non-ICU patients, patients who received ICU care
had numerous laboratory abnormalities. These abnormali-
ties suggest that 2019-nCoV infection may be associated with
cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocar-
dia injury, hepatic injury, and kidney injury. These laboratory
abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in pa-
tients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection.

> The dynamic profile of laboratory findings was tracked in
33 patients with NCIP (5 nonsurvivors and 28 survivors). In the
nonsurvivors, the neutrophil count, D-dimer, blood urea, and
creatinine levels continued to increase, and the lymphocyte
counts continued to decrease until death occurred. Neutro-
philia may be related to cytokine storm induced by virus in-
vasion, coagulation activation could have been related to sus-
tained inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury could
have been related to direct effects of the virus, hypoxia, and
shock. The 3 pathologic mechanisms may be associated with
the death of patients with NCIP.

> Until now, no specific treatment has been recommended
for coronavirus infection except for meticulous supportive
care.17 Currently, the approach to this disease is to control
the source of infection; use of personal protection precaution
to reduce the risk of transmission; and early diagnosis,
isolation, and supportive treatments for affected patients.
Antibacterial agents are ineffective. In addition, no anti-
viral agents have been found to provide benefit for treating
SARS and MERS. All of the patients in this study received
antibacterial agents, 90% received antiviral therapy, and 45%
received methylprednisolone. The dose of oseltamivir and
methylprednisolone varied depending on disease severity.
However, no effective outcomes were observed.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/

>##How to correctly calculate the mortality rate during an outbreak

>The case fatality rate (CFR) represents the proportion of cases who eventually die from a disease.

>Once an epidemic has ended, it is calculated with the formula: deaths / cases.

>**But while an epidemic is still ongoing, as it is the case with the current novel coronavirus outbreak, this formula is, at the very least, ""naïve"" and can be ""misleading if, at the time of analysis, the outcome is unknown for a non negligible proportion of patients.""** [8]
(Methods for Estimating the Case Fatality Ratio for a Novel, Emerging Infectious Disease - Ghani et al, American Journal of Epidemiology).

>In other words, current deaths belong to a total case figure of the past, not to the current case figure in which the outcome (recovery or death) of a proportion (the most recent new cases) hasn't yet been determined.

>The correct formula, therefore, would appear to be:

>**CFR = deaths at day.x / cases at day.x-P**
*(where P = average period from case confirmation to death)*

>This would constitute a fair attempt to use values for cases and deaths belonging to the same group of patients.

>One issue can be that of determining whether there is enough data to estimate P with any precision, but it is certainly not P = 0 (what is implicitly used when applying the formula current deaths / current cases to determine CFR during an ongoing outbreak).

>An alternative method, which is also discussed in the American Journal of Epidemiology study cited previously, would be to use the formula:

>**CFR = deaths / (deaths + recovered)**

>which, using the latest data available, would be equal to:

>**724 / (724 + 2,410) = 23% CFR**

>Finally, we shall remember that while the 2003 SARS epidemic was still ongoing, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a fatality rate of 4% (or as low as 3%), whereas the final case fatality rate ended up being 9.6%.

A 23% CFR is definitely extremely concerning, but it's possibly much less than that due to less severe cases being under-reported. Hopefully the true mortality rate won't exceed that of SARS.

In any case, thank you for correcting me."

Professor Theresa MacPhail, a renowned expert on viral pathography, weighed in on the concern over the epidemic emerging in the United States. “In sum, there is an extremely low threat,” she said last Wednesday. “The denominator of total cases is based on those showing up to clinics. The actual number is probably much higher as most experts think that the illness is mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic in a large number of people.” Although this leads to a higher number of infected individuals, it means that the fatality rate is significantly lower than the sensationalized numbers that are reported.

Secondly, there is no evidence to suggest the Coronavirus survives for any extended period outside the body, and most similar viruses don't survive long at all. The chance that any product imported, particularly if it was via ship would be risky is incredibly low.

Thirdly, for the most part the Coronavirus has been contained to certain geographical locations in China. These locations won't be doing much manufacturing or importing at the moment.

However, all but 26 (699) has occurred in Hubei province. 2 deaths have occurred outside of mainland China (Hong Kong and Philippines). Mortality rate for Hubei province is 2.8% (699/24953). The mortality rate for cases outside of Hubei province is 0.26% (26/10010). If we throw out all Chinese data  points and just use data points outside of China the mortality rate is 0.58% (2/343). 

I think this shows that as long as these outbreaks can be contained to some degree and avoid overloading the health system the mortality from the virus can be lowered significantly. Hopefully the rates will even further decrease as therapy improves. Mortality rates are still higher than pandemics of the past like H1N1 which were in the neighborhood of 0.02%.

They have, but until modern times, every pangolin had been dried out and stored in the hold of a ship for several weeks.  They had been eating local bats, but it is now practical to ship in fresh bats from places like Indonesia, with new pathogens.

It is only very recently that a large number of Chinese have had the disposable income to eat weird shit.  It has always been a cultural practice, but even twenty years ago, the number of people who could afford of any type was low.

Viruses jump into the human population all the time.  Every manageable serious disease like measles, mumps, etc. was once a very deadly novel virus.  The Plague of Justinian, which brought the Roman Empire low, has been recently proven to be bubonic plague, but up until a few years ago, it was thought to be very possible that it was the moment when Rinderpest (cow virus) mutated into measles.  It was more deadly than the medieval bubonic plague.

>The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare initially stated that passengers who were subject to virus testing on cruise ships were exposed to fever and cough symptoms-those who were close contacts-and those who were close to Hong Kong's men who had been found to have been infected after abandoned. A total of 273 people explained. By the 7th, test results had been revealed, revealing that 61 people had been infected.  
>  
>６ The number of additional tests including the 70-year-old male and female in their 60s and the Chinese female in their 30s who were positive this time is not included in 273. The Chinese woman, who had symptoms such as fever and was consequently supposed to be tested as a close contact, in the same room as one who was positive. Two of the three people who tested negative on the additional tests also dropped out of the test for some reason.  
>  
>On the other hand, doctors have also approved the disembarkation of persons who became ill due to a disease other than the new virus, and one of the men and women of the United States was transported with symptoms of cerebral infarction, and another was accompanied by another person . Subsequent examination revealed that both were infected. Another, also sick and disembarked, was negative.  
>  
>検 査 **Newly conducted inspections of several tens of people are mainly for occupants who have been delayed until now. In addition, about 100 passengers and occupants have complained of poor physical condition such as fever.**  
>  
>Persons asked about the current number of passengers were muddied initially saying, ""I don't know the exact number,"" but on the night of the 8th, another person was transported with the exception of 64 infected people. Four people and three accompanying people explained that a total of seven people got off the ship. Five of them are negative on the test and two are on the test. It is said that 3,640 people are left on board."

MERS, another coronavirus, had a 35% lethality rate or 1 in 3 and you probably never even heard of that one. But it was a middle eastern pandemic in the mid 2010’s


Coronvirus currently has a mortality rate of 2%.

1. Have a normal body temperature for 3 days in a row

If I remember corerectly, there was a lack of nurses on this particular day, therefore they couldn't admit on full capacity. They admitted him on the next day, but he died a few hours later. We all know how critical time is in acute leukemia, so a treatment delay of 24 hours is not acceptable.

Up until 2003 German hospitals didn't operate on a DRG system but on a cost based system. They were paid for the amount of days the patients spent in a hospital, even if this amount was unreasonably high. This, of course, led the hospitals to discharge them very late. The DRG system was introduced to cut costs. However, the reimbursement per case is quite low, so the workload for nurses and doctors increased dramatically, which led to a mass exodus of staff (especially of nurses) over the years.

Because the shortage of nurses is still increasing and the number of cases where a patient can't be admitted is increasing, the German government has currently decided to exempt the cost of nurses from the DRG, hoping that this would help with the shortage of nurses. However, it's unclear how long it will take for this measure to be effective. Also, there is still a shortage of doctors, which remains unaddressed. Just a few days ago, doctors were striking in university hospitals. Right now, German hospitals operate beyond their capacities and the system would decompensate if the coronavirus were to spread."

Because this isn't just a one-off disaster like an Earthquake, many industries will be suffering from this for months. The biggest ones being Asian airliners and Cruiseliners. Tourism is going to fall off a cliff for the next few months. And the domino effect of mass layoffs will affect every other sector.

I do think the quarantine action taken was appropriate for long term growth. Look at what happened in Hubei. The medical systme was completely overrun and almost collapsed. The Chinese government is strong enough to help reinforce this one province, but they can't do the same if every province is collapsing. The whole country would collapse if no one can get any health care.

Coronavirus seems manageable as long as the system is not overwhelmed. The death rates outside of Hubei and outside of China are far lower than in hubei. So overall, I agree with the actions taken by China. This still doesn't mean we're not looking at recessions all over the world though."

It is no longer comparable to SARS, MERS, or Ebola. Making assumptions about mortality or transmission rates based on current data is a bad idea, for a number of reasons. I can't be bothered listing all of them, but number one in my mind is the fact that hospitals within Wuhan are completely swamped. The function of China's medical system means that patients cannot be tested and counted in stats for ncov, without being formally admitted to hospital. So what we are really seeing with this steady daily increase in new death/infection rates from the epicentre, is the result of turnover of available beds. But this turnover is obviously quite skewed on its own, as many people with the virus have likely been turned away and sent home to self quarantine. We have no way of knowing how many are dying within homes, or dying of nCov related issues, before they are even tested to be positive. That is a whole lot of data missing. So my point stands, making assumptions while we are literally in the BEGINNING of this outbreak is pretty pointless."

I suffer from the exact same problem ( 27 F). 
I have severe health anxiety and am prone to going down the doom and gloom rabbit hole. 
Especially about climate change. 
In regards to the coronavirus, I would try your best to find news articles about past “pandemic” outbreaks and comfort your wife with the knowledge that there have been other strains that have caused mass panic and turned out fine. Swine flu, bird flu, etc. 

As for climate change, I really believe she is correct in her assumption that the planet will be “uninhabitable” for your kids. I mean, not UNINHABITABLE, but very very different than it is today. BUT that does not mean your kids are going to live in a barren wasteland. If you live in a developed country, it’s pretty unlikely. The people who will be most severely impacted are those living in third world countries. I worry a lot about the climate crisis. To make myself feel a little more comforted, I make sure to live a lifestyle that contributes as little as possible to global emissions. Also, I participate in activist groups. The Sunrise Movement is a great one for starters. Check for groups and events in your area, I am positive you will find many! Tell her that her voice matters, and she can absolutely make a difference! 
Also, sit down with your wife and write a list of ways you can reduce your household waste and plastic consumption. 
Watch the documentary “Little Big Farm”. It can be comforting and spark a tiny bit of hope. 
Also, why don’t you scour reddit for POSITIVE environmental news? There are tons of universities publishing great work that help to combat climate change. Show her the good news. r/environment might be a good start. 

I hope this helps!"

Apparently it is possible to transfer the virus via nonporous fomites possibly up to a week or so.  This is easy to combat, however, by simply washing your hands.  The virus will not jump off the surface - you have to touch it, then infect yourself.

>Maria Van Kerkhove, of WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis division] said that evidence indicates the virus can be transmitted through the respiratory route, via droplets, and physical contact between people, but also from fomites, as the virus can live on surfaces for a short period of times

>Sidebar for the word of the day: [fomite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite):

>Any inanimate object, that when contaminated with or exposed to infectious agents, such as pathogenic bacteria, viruses or fungi, can transfer disease to a new host. In addition to objects in hospital settings, other common fomites for humans are door knobs, light switches, handrails, elevator buttons, television remote controls, pens, and other items that are frequently touched by different people and that may be infrequently cleaned.

>Researchers have discovered that smooth (non-porous) surfaces like door knobs transmit bacteria and viruses better than porous materials like paper money because porous, especially fibrous, materials absorb and trap the contagion, making it harder to contract through simple touch.

>So far as I know, there is no case of #2019-nCoV with a history of fomite transmission, so we will have to look to other viruses for indications. End sidebar.

>From the American Society for Microbiology, “[Significance of Fomites in the Spread of Respiratory and Enteric Viral Disease](https://aem.asm.org/content/73/6/1687)” (2007), a review of the literature:

>There is now growing evidence that contaminated fomites or surfaces play a key role in the spread of viral infections.

>Virus spread by person-to-person contact can be interrupted with isolation of the viral carrier. Yet, isolation may prove to be impractical or difficult if there are many people or if the source of infection is unknown (69). Consequently, interrupting disease spread via indoor fomites is one of the more practical methods for limiting or preventing enteric and respiratory viral infections.

>A majority of respiratory viruses are enveloped (parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, RSV, and coronavirus) and survive on surfaces from hours to days….

>Studies have demonstrated that viral transfer from hands to surrounding surfaces is possible in 7 out of 10 viruses reviewed. Generally, research evidence suggests that a large portion of enteric and respiratory illnesses can be prevented through improved environmental hygiene, with an emphasis on better hand and surface cleaning practices.

>(So clean your keyboards, light switches, etc. besides washing your hands!) For a corona virus, although not #2019-nCoV specifically, from the American Society for Microbiology, “Effects of Air Temperature and Relative Humidity on Coronavirus Survival on Surfaces” (2010):

>The potential reemergence of SARS or the emergence of new strains of pandemic influenza virus, including avian and swine influenza viruses, could pose serious risks for nosocomial disease spread via contaminated surfaces. However, this risk is still poorly understood, and more work is needed to quantify the risk of exposure and possible transmission associated with surfaces.

Perhaps there are other papers that looked into the expression of ACE2 receptors across different ethnicities.

""First American and Japanese deaths reported in Coronavirus epidemic."" - Washington Post

""First American Dies of Coronavirus, Raising Questions About U.S. Response."" - New York Times

I'd wager there will be more deaths & hospitalizations from the heat than the virus.

Also, there are many Olympic qualifying events in Japan / Korea etc. going on right now, which might reveal some measures Tokyo might take.

There were obviously tons of tourists there, including many many chinese tourists.... Then, we traveled through LA K-Town, and then from San Diego - Northern VA in 4 days. We traveled across multiple states that have had confirmed cases, and used maaannnyyyyy resting areas and gas stations bc I’m pregnant and my daughter pees a lot lol. 
The second to last day of our trip, at night in our hotel, my daughter randomly starts vomiting. Luckily I have Zofran for my pregnancy sickness, and checked the dosages for her age online and gave it to her - she instead has massive diarrhea and off and on and off and on vomitting when the Zofran just wasn’t enough... I caught it the next night, but I’m very used to throwing up and handling the dehydration due to the disease I have during my pregnancies, and so I just powered through it all night long until I’m pretty sure I threw up whatever was getting us in there.
My husband the next day.
My son... was weird. His started as a runny nose and very mild cough and mild diarrhea. I kept him hydrated and eating food, and when we got back to our home state, he was normal kid sick and had a fever with body aches etc.... I kept it down with tylenol, and he was ‘normal kid sick’ and I’m a nazi about keeping water down him, so I had him drinking it 24.7.... yet the next day he went from normal kid sick to legit limp in my arms and unresponsive. Since I’m uneducated, I thought he was legit dying in my arms. We freaked and drove to ER, they said he was at least breathing etc - did EVERY!!!!! test on him possible, including a lumbar puncture, because they really couldn’t wrap their heads around how he was so bad and unresponsive and how it went from 0-100 without any vomitting and not a ton of diarrhea. His tests showed his glucose at 55 (so low) and dehydrated (but not horribly so) and so they gave him popsicles and fluids.... after his glucose climbed back up past 100, it still took him 2 days of being hospitalized to recover. They even sent stool tests in and found nothing... so it was just closed as being dehydration mixed with low blood sugar - but none of the doctors seemed 100% on this and just used it as a “there’s no other reason we can find” type explanation.

After this, my entire family who lives in my house (kids, hubby, me, my mom) started running noses and coughs. My mom got insanely sick but avoided the ER at all costs and instead took pain meds and antibiotics (she won’t listen to me to go to Dr, so don’t even comment lol :( ) 
My husband got insanely sick for a few days and then it has now trickled into a sniffle, runny nose and mild cough.
I got sick and had chest pain and shortness of breath so I went to the ER - they found nothing in my lungs besides something called like pulmonary inflammation? Idk
My daughter got sick and then recovered, but still has a runny nose and mild cough. So do I. We’ve had the mild symptoms about 1.5 weeks now.
I told the doctors/nurses about our travel situation, and though they seemed to want to test us, they said:
1. You must have contact with someone who has traveled to Wuhan in the last 21 days.
2. You must have had contact with a person who is confirmed sick with coronavirus.
3. You must have had contact with someone of Chinese descent who was showing symptoms of being sick/confirmed sick.

They then said since I only know I was around chinese tourists, and I have no idea if they were sick or not, then I cannot qualify to be tested. 


Great timing to be given a ton of anxiety about all of this, huh? Lol"

I live in a wealthy Western country that has equivocated on the number of new cases and their circumstances, taken no preventative actions, and reminded us not to be racist against Chinese. Why does a government have such brazen disregard for its own people? Because its beholden to modern progressive doctrine, which says that globalization and world trade and the race to greater and greater ""prosperity"" matters more and cannot be stopped, and we have our international organizations and advanced medicine to help us cope with the fallout. In the end, many will get sick and spread disease, and it's because people have become enraptured by their blind faith in modernity: that things are better now, that things will only get better.

*  ""China's gross mishandling of this disease"": They could have done better, but they're improving from the SARS outbreaks and they're arguably doing better than many Western societies that are facing major public health crises.
* ""neo-colonialism vote manipulation of the WHO"": I've seen no evidence that this is actually happening, despite a lot of people claiming it.
* ""China isn't releasing reliable information"": Realistically, the number of cases is greater than the official statistics for confirmed cases. Equally realistically, the number of tests being ordered for the coronavirus is probably enough to use all capacity in testing facilities. China literally built [an entire new facility specifically to test for this virus](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/02/07/new-lab-in-wuhan-begins-testing-for-coronavirus); this wouldn't be necessary if there wasn't a backlog of tests.
* ""...all combines into the fact no one actually knows how contagious it is, its mortally rate, or how bad this is going to get."": There is uncertainty about this, sure. The disease presents with mild symptoms in a lot of people. There has been 1 death in 270 patients outside China so far, suggesting a mortality rate of 0.3%; these are in societies that are aggressively testing *suspected* cases and close contacts of cases.
* "" We'll know by the end of the month. And not because any number of intelligent people figured it out, our own CDC stopped releasing information to the public early this week, we'll just count the bodies."": The US reports cases to the World Health Organisation. The US currently has 12 confirmed cases; the last new case was on the 6th of February. The last CDC update was on the 7th. What you're saying here seems needlessly fatalistic; what exactly do you expect them to announce?

The first is to suppress bad news, leading to what I think is systematic underreporting across China, which has been upping the bar for what is considered a nCov case. The second is to act drastically in eliminating any threat of the coronavirus appearing, which leads to those containment measures. In the end, there's only so much you can censor, and a building contaminated is impossible to fully keep under wraps.

I'll also add that if major cities like Beijing gets a sustained outbreak, then heads coild roll beyond the local governments. The politburo will throw away some of their own to quell the anger if it must."

Q: Am I at risk for novel coronavirus from a package or products shipping from China?

In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the 2019 Novel Coronavirus website as it becomes available

This interview of a front line doctor: 
https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-06/reporters-notebook-we-interview-front-line-coronavirus-doctor-101512020.html

“I've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. 

There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. 

Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. 

The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.


The third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.

For most, the illness is over ‪in two weeks‬, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die ‪in three weeks‬.

35 year old male - symptom progression day 1 to 12

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191


On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and “remains isolated at home.”) see;

Is there anything keeping you from leaving or are you just trusted not to|so in China everyone lives in residential compounds with security guards (its not a rich or poor thing EVERYONE lives in compounds). ever since the outbreak we've been required to register our names every time we leave or come in. right now i'm trusted to pretty much not leave, but in the news there has been people trying to leave and police did have to be involved.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgwi5kw/)
Is it worse than what the media is portraying it to be? What is life like in China now? Are people the same or less willing to interact with one another?|i heard the situation is bad at ground zero - overflowing hospitals, doctors without resources etc. but the media (both chinese and foreign) have been portraying that as well, so id say it is an apt representation? Shanghai is where the party trains their best officials so things here have been pretty smooth, life is essentially staying at home: doing schoolwork at home, working from home etc. In terms of interaction, there is a LOT of stigma against people from Hubei in general. And its bad to the point where hubei license plates basically can't be driven around/drive on highways since they get pulled over so often. A lot of insults hurled at people from Hubei who has left the province as well. i see both sides but you cant possibly expect those people to stay in an infected cesspool.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgxp25c/)
Where's Waldo?|under quarantine|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgwi6ic/)
What’s the general sentiment there regarding the death of the whistleblower doctor?|Obviously everyone is pissed, and the fact that I know everyones pissed is quite surprising. Ive had friends and relatives post about how its despicable the circumstances under which he died, which usually would've probably meant a trip to the police station but those posts are still up. the government is trying to spin this by making him a state martyr and sent a anti-corruption team to wuhan, but i think everyone sees through it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgwo6kg/)
I was accepted to NYU Shanghai and was seriously considering attending starting this September, though I rejected the offer pretty early on. Some people were saying it's good I didn't accept. Do you think the situation will remain this way for a long time or is it getting better?|to be honest i have no idea. i was like rly young when sars happened but from what i heard the warm weather pretty much killed it off??? even from government figures the situation is worsening so imo this would go till mid-march at the very least. nyu shanghai is literally just one building at the middle of nowhere so probably a good decision nonetheless.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgwpafa/)
How do you get food and groceries?|this is done through deliveries. food delivery culture is much more prevalent (and cheaper) here than the states or the West in general. on food delivery apps you can order anything thats available at a super market, at pretty much supermarket prices. in the current situation they deliver to the compounds themselves, and get the guards to deliver it to your door, hence making the process ""contactless"". for meats that you have to refrigerate there are cold lockers at the security office where you pick up your meat.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgwu777/)
How did you get on Reddit?|vpn. works pretty nice to go over the wall.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgx1dhu/)
What is your current social credit score?|I think the coronavirus is making it so that the government won't roll out the program until later. I have a foreign passport anyway so this policy wont affect me.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgxd4z7/)
Is the virus as bad as the Western news is making it? Are you suspicious of your gov. hiding anything (there’s conspiracies in the West that they’re lying about certain aspects). Has anybody you know been infected? How are your hospitals holding up, videos have been circulating that are graphic, is it really like that?  How do you get food?|The virus is pretty bad in hubei province, not as bad elsewhere. Obviously the numbers are deflated, though the extent to which they are im not sure about - there are rumors online that hospitals has stopped accepting people so they don't get tested for the virus, which means that they don't show up on official statistics. However I heard the state is cracking down on that. Hospitals are being overflowed in Hubei province only, and the state is building more hospitals, reclaiming abandoned buildings and stadiums etc. I've seen those videos too and can only hope the hospitals are getting the relief they need.  I get food and fresh produce from delivery, I elaborate on that in a previous answer.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgxuwvs/)
Are people going mad and biting eachother?|I don't think biting, but I've seen videos of a patient pulling down a doctor's masks and spitting at him?? im sure its not happening widely though. probably highly illegal too, for obvious reasons.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgyctnj/)
ive been seeing a lot footage of people collapsing appearing to on the break of death. so does a death count of 580 sound right to u?|Eh it’s sketchy. The thing is some people die before they get diagnosed and the cause of death is simply “pneumonia”, so I suppose if you consolidate the data on pneumonia deaths and add it to coronavirus deaths that’s probably the actual death count.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgz92bu/)
any advice on how to avoid catching the virus?|Stay the fuck home.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/f0qg67/im_quarantined_at_my_house_in_shanghai_bored_af/fgz9r6h/)

The question is not, *""What will likely kill me/my family fastest if I find myself totally without this item?""*

The question is, *""What item that is significantly likely (or absolutely necessary) to boost my odds of survival is likely to be unavailable to me first?""*

First, the reason the masks & other protective gear comes to the top of most people's minds is that (a bit of a self fullfilling prophecy), people think that OTHER people will go for those first & therefore be some of the first items to run out.  Second, even if other items are technically more critical, if one is already sick w/ the virus, one's ability to secure the other items may be greatly diminished, so goal #1 is to avoid getting the virus in the first place.

Potable water & food is absolutely critical for survival, but it's unlikely to be one of the first items to run out.  First, city services aren't likely to stop immediately.  Second, even if traditional water & food supply chains start to dry up, people can get various water filtration/purification systems & ration, forage, grow, or hunt for food if necessary.

Certain potentially criticial items that CAN'T be easily replaced or obtained with improvisation will get hoarded/stolen first.  Face masks & other personal protective gear are some items.  If this goes on long enough, over the counter painkillers, anti-inflamation drugs, fever reduction drugs, etc. would be next.  Certain common perscription drugs like antibiotics, insulin, anti-virals, etc. would be critical too. Although many of these won't help much with treating a novel coronavirus case directly, they WOULD help garden-variety aliments that could become lethal if the entire healthcare system breaks down. Suffering from run-of-the-mill diabetes, an infection from a cut, a severe fever, an abcessed tooth, etc., are pretty much death sentences if the entire supply chain breaks down for a year or two.

There are other critical items like solar powered generators, various weapons, clothing, and shelter that eventually would become either critical or at minimum very handy.  However, I think people would have a greater ability to forage/loot these things from vacated buildings, or a greater ability to improvise alternative solutions (wood burning stoves/propane, etc.)"

I’m doing the best I can with getting extra supplies and  going through my daily motions like normal but honestly I don’t think I’ll be able to cope with it until it either starts feeling “real” or fades away. 
Too much unknowing right now (at least in the states)

So much has happened in such a short time. It was only two weeks ago, January 25th that I first even heard about the virus. I received a text from my brother who was in Dubai. He made a comment about all the people wearing doctors mask at the airport and then followed it with a Coronavirus meme. I had to look up what he was talking about...
Since then I’ve been following this sub and the news about the virus on other sites everyday.
It started as a curiosity and then it became intriguing; watching the numbers, seeing the videos, hearing the different stories. Now it’s a bit of an obsession laced with sadness for the people who are getting hit hard with this right now, disheartenment in the country I live in, mental exhaustion, bewilderment, anger and a few hopeful/positive emotions. This feels so huge and yet I feel like the only people I have to connect with about it are the people on this sub. Y’all are researching, thinking about it, questioning it, feeling it and thank you for that. Gosh just the fact that y’all have your eyes open to it, hopeful or not, is helping me. Everyday that passes I feel like I’m living in the twilight zone. Everything is so mind blowing; there’s the government on one hand doing things that are SO RIDICULOUSLY DUMB it’s truly unbelievable, (I live in NJ btw; I don’t think I have to tell the story about our governor and his recent love for cruises) and there’s the CDC and the WHO on the other hand and the things they say and do compared to the rest world, I just can’t. There are NO WORDS to even express how to decipher their actions. Speechless. And the news channels, Holy crow! I have always been used to them feeding on this type of craziness and they have been barely touching it. Its crickets. And to top it all off my family, friends and co-workers are waking around like it’s freakin’ Pleasantville and not a care in the world. I’m so confused on the daily. Twilight zone.
My personal opinion and feeling is this virus is gonna get bad so I have started to prepare with extra food and medical supplies but now I’m researching as much as I can about lung issues and viruses and things I can do to help heal. I’d like to say I won’t catch this virus but I think it may be inevitable especially with how the US and NJ is reacting. If I get sick I’d rather be at home than the hospitals and just try my best to get better.
Still kind of feel like I’m in limbo than in a coping phase but knowing that there are others out there really looking into this virus and taking it cautiously/seriously (the sub) is helping a lot more than i think I realized"

CCP is pushing hard for other provinces to keep their real stats hushed, and pushing the need for deaths to be ""unrelated to coronavirus"" above all else. That is their primary objective right now. Meanwhile HK has low infected, but has already reported one nCoV related death, probably as a middle finger to the CCP.

This is just what my tin-foil hat wearing head is coming up with for now. Could also be that infectious populations haven't developed enough yet to really strain medical services in those provinces yet. So they can still help patients fully recover."

""They also reignite a debate about whether that information justifies the [risk of such work](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31876/title/Deliberating-Over-Danger/), known as gain-of-function research. “If the \[new\] virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory,” Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris,""

&#x200B;

The GOF (gain of function) research debate was brought up again in 2018, hearkening back to the 2015 study:

**Is regulation preventing the development of therapeutics that may prevent future coronavirus pandemics?**

""Gain of function (GOF) research is critical for microbiological research in determining causal relationships between a mutation and its phenotype. In 2012, two studies describing GOF mutations facilitating the transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza in ferrets set off a firestorm of debate ultimately resulting in a ‘pause’ of active GOF research and its future funding.""

""As defined by the 2014 GOF policy, the creation of SARS MA15, HKU3 and HKU5 adapted viruses would have been prohibited, seriously eroding the development of key systems for therapeutic evaluation. In fact, the ‘pause’ halted all US efforts to adapt MERS-CoV in small animals. This moratorium was lifted months later for a few laboratories leading to the development of several animal models that replicate many aspects of human disease. Given that there are no US FDA approved therapies for any CoV, these mouse models have been essential for the preclinical development of multiple MERS-CoV therapeutics.""

""Given the massive amount of morbidity and mortality associated with EIDs over the past 30 years, the balance between public health risk and inaction is clear. For EIDs, the myopic ‘one bug, one drug’ approach will forever be regressive as the therapy specifically designed for the past epidemic strain (e.g., SARS-CoV vaccine) will likely fail against future emergence (i.e., MERS-CoV). ""

""**Regulation must adequately protect public safety but should also be fluid enough to evolve in step with EIDs.** Despite the best intentions, **one of the greatest risks of biosafety policy** is unintended over-reach that limits our understanding of EID biology and **prevents countermeasure development that could limit or prevent future pandemics.**""

A chimera virus is a ""new hybrid microorganism created by joining nucleic acid fragments from two or more different microorganisms in which each of at least two of the fragments contain essential genes necessary for replication."" 

Combining two [pathogenic viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease) increases the lethality of the new virus[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(virus)#cite_note-collett-3) which is why there have been cases where chimeric viruses have been considered for use as a [bioweapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent).

Studies have shown that chimeric viruses can also be developed to have medical benefits."

He never posted anything about the Coronavirus or China and a bio weapon until the news started coming out, yet he now magically has articles on his site dated as far back as 2013 in an effort to make it look like he had been covering aspects of the story for years, and especially through mid to late 2019.

In fact, he just backdated the posts in the WordPress database, unfortunately for him there are 2 problems:

1. He does not know that WordPress will still arrange them in the order they are written unless you modify it in a particular way. Because of this, the posts are listed in the real order on his blog and it’s obvious that the date was simply edited. There are old articles mixed in with new ones, and the rest are all sorted properly by date.

2. archive.org has several snapshots of his site throughout 2014 to the Present - none of these posts existed! The only post even remotely related would have been one from August 19th about the “Thousand Talents” program, but did not specifically mention anything that would tie it to this story at the time - note that it has now been edited as recently as Feb 3rd, 2020.

He did not post a single story about Coronavirus or a Chinese Bioweapons program until January 24th, 2020!

But don’t take my word for it, here’s a snapshot from late October:

https://web.archive.org/web/20191020163059/http://greatgameindia.com/

Yet he now has posts including “Canadian Lab Acquires Coronavirus Sample” dated May 16, 2013, to the alleged theft of the virus July 23, 2019, and other Coronavirus stories sprinkled around including more posts in August, and October.

Here you can see that even in November 2019 there were no posts related to Coronavirus:

2020-02-08,dangerface,China_Flu,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f0rgr2/almost_3_weeks_between_exposure_and_official/fgyt8oc/,"First they have to obtain samples of the virus, then culture it, then sequence its genome, then identify potential bits to target as the “key” to the test, then create those little bits synthetically, then test all these different targets to identify something adequately sensitive *and* specific to avoid both false positives and false negatives, then prove that it’s effective, then standardize the whole protocol, then disseminate to other labs to prove it’s repeatable, then disseminate further when they’re ready to actually “go live” across the country with this protocol, then all of these medical labs have to do their own tests and adopt the protocol, then start receiving patient specimens from hospitals and clinics, then extract the DNA from those samples and run the protocol to detect these specific targets in the samples (or not), which requires hours of repeated cycles of heating/cooling tiny samples to copy/amplify the signal - if it’s even in there, then report the result.

Given that the genome was only sequenced a little over a WEEK ago, I’d say this is all happening incredibly fast! The consequences of doing it wrong or just not choosing the best targets to go after could mean thousands or millions of false positive and/or false negative results, which could actually be very harmful to patients, public, economies, diplomacy, etc...

So it’s not just an abstract “test kit” like a boxed pregnancy test from the drug store. It’s a very complex protocol development process. Fortunately, it’s the same generic process used for many other viral diagnostic purposes, so we didn’t have to reinvent the general process, just the specific protocol for *this* new one. Also fortunately, CDC is only recommending biosafety level 2 (BSL2) facilities for processing 2019-CoV specimens. BSL3 would be *very* restrictive and severely limit testing capacity as there are only a handful of BSL3 facilities in the US. 

Once the protocol is developed and standardized, the testing capacity is theoretically no different from our capacity to test for confirmatory hepatitis or HIV viral presence. Note that *screening* tests for hepatitis and HIV are most often different assays (ELISA for detection of serum antibodies that shouldn’t be present unless the patient was exposed to the virus). If this screening is positive, THEN real-time PCR testing is done to confirm qualitatively and/or quantitatively the presence of actual viral genetic components in the sample. 

Also note that I am not yet actually sure real-time PCR is what they’re using. It’s just an educated guess based on some articles I’ve read, experience in the field, and reports from family whose entire profession is in the commercial development of exactly this kind of laboratory testing. In fact, they’ve developed a respiratory viral panel that includes coronavirus, but that was before 2019-nCoV, so still not sure their test is reliable for it. Would need control samples to experiment with first.

Now... in the next week or three, we should see much more testing and clearer data regarding the true spread of 2019-nCoV. That is, if governments don’t try to artificially limit testing to keep numbers low to prevent panic... which in my opinion will only risk even greater panic as trust eroded and the virus spreads (see example set by China with both SARS and now 2019-nCoV as well).

Hope that bit of insight helps."

The army was either being called to “manage” things on the Diamond Princess or for evacuation, a staffer said.A luxury cruise liner — World Dream — with 73 Indian crew members has been quarantined in Hong Kong, reports Saurabh Sinha.

A 26-year-old employed as a steward on the ship made a desperate call to his family in Karnataka, urging them to seek help from the government. Carnival Corporation & plc, the company which owns the ship, has assured his parents there was no need to panic and the Indian embassy also emailed a statement to them that it was in constant touch with local Japanese authorities.On Thursday, the call for help on 
Facebook of another crew member, Binay Kumar Sarkar, had gone viral. He told TOIthat it’s all hands on deck now. “We’re all chipping in — in the kitchen, with supplies, cleaning,” he said.
Sarkar added that “speaking out of turn” may not have been prudent. Till Friday, he was a chef. As of Saturday, he is a phone operator. Back home in Kolkata, his appeal led to a flurry of activity.

Based on its determination, the team, headed by Hokkaido University professor Hiroshi Nishiura, has called for preventive measures as well as reinforcing the medical care system against a potential sharp rise in coronavirus patients, rather than focusing exclusively on isolation as a way to contain the disease.

According to the estimate based on 26 human-to-human infection cases released by six countries such as China, Thailand and the United States, the timing of the secondary infection was shorter than previously thought.

Although the average period of incubation for the coronavirus originating from central China is believed to be about five days, the researchers found that second patients in more than half of the 26 human-to-human infection cases under study developed pneumonia symptoms within five days.
The team concluded that these second patients were infected with the virus during its incubation period for the first patients.

""The findings suggest that it is difficult to contain the illness simply by isolation,"" Nishiura said. ""We need to put more emphasis on prevention of infection for people with high risks such as the elderly.""

""It is also important to prepare the medical care system so that we will not experience confusion even in the event of a greater number of pneumonia patients,"" he added."

Since I had a China stamp from a layover on Jan 4 (prior to coronavirus) within the recent month, they wanted me to take a medical examination.

""Suspected cases were also included for investigation. **The diagnostic criteria for confirmed cases have not changed (requires real-time fluorescent RT-PCR of respiratory specimens or blood specimens to detect positive new-type coronavirus nucleic acid; or viral gene sequencing, which is highly homologous with known new-type coronaviruses.)**

>Hubei Province added a ""clinical diagnosis"" classification. And the ""suspected case"" standard is modified to: whether with or without epidemiological history, as long as it meets the two clinical manifestations of ""fever and / or respiratory symptoms"" and ""normal or reduced white blood cells in the early stage of onset, or decreased lymphocyte count"", then Can be considered a suspected case. This is equivalent to the relaxation of suspected cases. **Suspected cases with pneumonia imaging features are clinically diagnosed cases.** The diagnostic criteria for confirmed cases have not changed.

So not much changed aside from creating an exclusion for inside hubei where they don't require epidemiological history.

As you can see, confirmed cases are done through laboratory results whereas suspected cases with radiological evidence are clinically diagnosed but still considered suspected case."

In other provinces (like where I am), I think the numbers are correct (sorry all the China haters) mainly because of the information we are be given each day for each new case. Every day updated information about the movements of any new case (buses, trains, planes taken etc) are provided so we can check if we were there at the same time. Regrading the hospitals, each city has allocated certain hospitals to deal with the coronavirus. So as to not contaminate every hospital (people are still having babies, breaking arms etc) I haven't been near any of the 'coronavirus hospitals' (for obvious reasons) but i would assume they are busy, but not packed. As i said in the video, it's not super serious here and I hope it won't be.

Foxconn will not reopen its factories on February 10 as planned.
    
Public health experts have said that Foxconn's Shenzhen factories face a ""high risk of coronavirus infection.""
    
Authorities say it does not want to risk the virus spreading in such a labor-intensive working environment.

Local authorities have called off Foxconn's plan to reopen its factories in Shenzhen over fears they could be a hotbed for spreading the coronavirus.

As reported by Nikkei Asian Review:

    
Key iPhone supplier Foxconn's plan to resume production on Feb. 10 has been called off by the Chinese authorities due to worries surrounding the coronavirus outbreak, the Nikkei Asian Review has learned. Public health experts in Shenzhen informed Foxconn, which trades as Hon Hai Precision Industry, that its factories there face ""high risks of coronavirus infection"" after conducting on-site inspections and therefore are not suitable to restart work, four people familiar with the matter told Nikkei.

A memo seen by the outlet reportedly said that anyone found in ""violation of epidemic prevention and control could potentially face the death penalty.""

Perhaps even more worryingly for Apple, the report states that Foxconn has also canceled its plans to resume work at its Zhengzhou plant, which is the world's biggest iPhone production base. A source in the report stated:

    
""The local governments do not want to risk the potential virus spreading in such a labor-intensive working environment. No one wants to bear the responsibility of restarting work at this critical moment.""

It seems that the factories are considered particularly vulnerable given the use of central air conditioning used to keep dust out of the assembly process, along with the extremely high density of workers and close conditions.

The Zhengzhou complex will not be able to reopen until approved by the local government.

Yesterday, it emerged that Shenzhen workers had been told not to return to work at the end of the Lunar Break, which had already been extended to February 10.

Official figures now put the coronavirus death doll at 722, with reports of 31,744 confirmed patients.

Apple's iPad supplier Compal Electronics has also reportedly postponed plans to reopen by another week, to February 17. Apple also announced yesterday that it would extend closure of its retail stores to February 15."

2020-02-08,CharlieXBravo,China,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/f0uqle/wheres_xi_chinas_leader_commands_coronavirus/fgyigwk/,"The government is also having trouble controlling the narrative. Mr. Xi now faces unusually sharp public discontent that even China’s rigorous censorship apparatus [has been unable to stifle entirely](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/technology/china-coronavirus-censorship-social-media.html).

The [death of an ophthalmologist in Wuhan, Dr. Li Wenliang](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/world/asia/china-coronavirus-doctor-death.html), who was censured for warning his medical school classmates of the spread of a dangerous new disease in December, [has unleashed a torrent of pent-up public grief and rage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/business/china-coronavirus-doctor-death.html) over the government’s handling of the crisis. Chinese academics have launched at least two petitions in the wake of Dr. Li’s death, each [calling for freedom of speech](http://wqw2010.blogspot.com/2020/02/blog-post_8.html).

State media still portray Mr. Xi as ultimately in control, and there’s no sign that he faces a serious challenge from within the party leadership. The crisis, though, has already tainted China’s image as an emerging superpower — efficient, stable and strong — that could eventually rival the United States.

How much the crisis might erode Mr. Xi’s political standing remains to be seen, but it could weaken his position in the longer run as he prepares to take a likely third term as Communist Party general secretary in 2022.

 

In 2018, Mr. Xi won approval to [remove the constitutional limits](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/world/asia/china-xi-jinping.html) on his term as the country’s president, making his plan for another five-year term seem all but certain.

If Mr. Xi comes out of this crisis politically insecure, the consequences are unpredictable. He may become more open to compromise within the party elite. Or he may double down on the imperious ways that have made him China’s most powerful leader in generations.

 “Xi’s grip on power is not light,” said[ Jude Blanchette](https://www.csis.org/people/jude-blanchette), the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“While the ham-fisted response to this crisis undoubtedly adds a further blemish to Xi’s tenure in office,” Mr. Blanchette added, “the logistics of organizing a leadership challenge against him remain formidable.”

In recent days, despite a dearth of public appearances, state media have portrayed Mr. Xi as a tireless commander in chief. This week they began calling the government’s fight against the virus the “people’s war,” a phrase used in the official readout of Mr. Xi’s telephone call with President Trump on Friday.

There are increasing signs that the propaganda this time is proving less than persuasive.

The Lunar New Year reception in Beijing where Mr. Xi spoke became a source of popular anger, a symbol of a government slow to respond to the suffering in Wuhan. Mr. Xi and other leaders appear to have been caught off guard by the ferocity of the epidemic.

Senior officials would almost certainly have been informed of the emerging crisis by the time national health authorities told the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, but neither Mr. Xi nor other officials in Beijing informed the public.

Mr. Xi’s first acknowledgment of the epidemic came on Jan. 20, when [brief instructions](http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2020-01/21/nw.D110000renmrb_20200121_1-01.htm) were issued under his name. His first public appearance after the lockdown of Wuhan on Jan. 23 came two days later, when he presided over a meeting of the Communist Party’s top body, the Politburo Standing Committee, which was shown at length on Chinese television. “We’re sure to be able to win in this battle,” he proclaimed.

 Back then, the death toll was 106. As it rose, Mr. Xi allowed other officials to take on more visible roles. Mr. Xi’s only appearances have been meeting foreign visitors in the Great Hall of the People or presiding over Communist Party meetings.

On Jan. 28, Mr. Xi met with the executive director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and told Dr. Tedros that he “personally directed” the government’s response. Later reports in state media omitted the phrase, saying instead that Mr. Xi’s government was “collectively directing” the response.

Since nothing about how Mr. Xi is portrayed in state media happens by accident, the tweak suggested a deliberate effort to emphasize shared responsibility.

Mr. Xi did not appear on official broadcasts again for a week — until a highly scripted meeting on Wednesday with the authoritarian leader of Cambodia, Hun Sen.

There is little evidence that Mr. Xi has given up power behind the scenes. Mr. Li, the premier in formal charge of the leadership group for the crisis, and other officials have said that they take their orders from Mr. Xi. The group is filled with officials who work closely under Mr. Xi, and its directives emphasize his authority.

“The way the epidemic is being handled now from the top just doesn’t fit with the argument that there’s been a clear shift toward more collective, consultative leadership,” said [Holly Snape](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/staff/hollysnape/), a British Academy Fellow at the University of Glasgow who studies Chinese politics.

The scale of discontent and the potential challenges for Mr. Xi could be measured by repeated references online to the nuclear accident at Chernobyl. Many of them came under the guise of viewer reviews of [the popular television mini-series of the same name](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/arts/television/review-chernobyl-hbo.html), which is still available for streaming inside China.

 “In any era, any country, it’s the same. Cover everything up,” one [reviewer wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/technology/china-coronavirus-censorship-social-media.html). 

 The Soviet Union of 1986, however, was a different country than China in 2020.

The Soviet state was foundering when Chernobyl happened, said Sergey Radchenko, a professor of international relations at Cardiff University in Wales who has written extensively on Soviet and Chinese politics.

“The Chinese authorities, by contrast, are demonstrating an ability to cope, a willingness to take unprecedented measures — logistical feats that may actually increase the regime’s legitimacy,” he added.

Mr. Radchenko compared Mr. Xi’s actions to those of previous leaders in moments of crisis: Mao Zedong after the Cultural Revolution or Deng Xiaoping after the Tiananmen Square crackdown.

“He’s doing what Mao and Deng would have done in similar circumstances: stepping back into the shadows while remaining firmly in charge.”

Public health experts carried out inspections at Foxconn’s factories in the southern city of Shenzhen and told the company that its factories had a “high risk of coronavirus infection”, making them unsuitable for a production restart, the newspaper said, citing four people familiar with the matter without identifying them.

A Foxconn iPhone plant will also not restart work in the central city of Zhengzhou on Monday, the report added.

Taiwan’s Foxconn said operation schedules for its facilities in China followed the recommendations of local governments, but declined to comment on specific production facilities.

“We have not received any requests from our customers on the need to resume production earlier (than the local governments’ recommendations),” the company said in an emailed statement.

Foxconn could see a “big” production impact and shipments to customers including Apple face disruption if a Chinese factory halt extends into a second week, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters earlier this week."

touching the lowest level since the recession in December. This key
yardstick for the manufacturing sector had been in contraction
territory for five straight months. So the move to expansion from
contraction is certainly welcome, but we are not completely out of
the woods with the trade war, and we are only beginning to
understand the potential effects of the coronavirus outbreak and
what it means for supply chains

\

> . The non-manufacturing ISM has
been less vulnerable to some of the factors that have buffeted the
factory sector like the trade war and the slowing in global growth,
which perhaps explains why the service sector ISM has remained
in expansion territory throughout 2019. We learned this week that
in January the non-manufacturing ISM edged higher to 55.5 with
most subcomponents also in expansion territory."

>  
>What would you say to people who say that we should just abandon the cause in Iraq and Afghanistan?

Many lives have been lost, both from our own country and by citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan. Personally, I think we've passed the point of no return and to leave now would be premature. I think the State Department should be setting the agenda, not the Department of Defense.

>What would you say to people who said that the US military/NATO went into Iraq and Afghanistan “for oil” or the military industrial complex?

Maybe we did, maybe we didn't. If we did (and there was a conspiracy), those people who were in power when it occurred who knew it was a false narrative should be imprisoned. If we didn't, then we need to focus on an exit strategy that honors the wishes of the people of Iraq and Afghanistan.

>What do you think whenever people say that the US military intentionally kills/murders Middle Easterners (or South Asians in Afghanistan’s case)?

I think they are anthropomorphizing the United States as if it were a single entity with a mind of its own. I think globally, while it may appear that we are targeting specific people based on their ethnicity, I have to apply the principle of charity and assume the reasons are justified at an international level. The concerning thing is our domestic policy; there, it is evident that there are institutionalized racism and policies that negatively impact people of color.

>Aside from “everyone in the Marine Corps is in the infantry”, what are some other myths and misconceptions about the Marine Corps that you want to quash?

We don't eat Crayons as much as everyone thinks, maybe only a few times a week.

>Could you see yourself being POTUS sometime in the future?

Of the 107 billion people who have lived on this planet, only 45  have been POTUS. I'm not holding my breath, but being in a position to positively impact the lives of people is my ultimate goal.

>Aside from “don’t marry the first girl you see right out of boot camp/MCT/MOS school”, “don’t buy a ridiculously expensive car when you’re just a PFC”, “wrap it before you tap it”, etc., what are some other tips that you would give to junior Marines and those of us who are enlisting?

The same thing a Master Sergeant told me at morse code school: become indispensable.

>I’m probably gonna be hitting soft spots here but what are your views on guns and the Second Amendment?

I replied to another comment on this. In short, I love guns but I can't have them because I have PTSD. Other people with PTSD probably shouldn't have them either (along with other reasons). To me, a gun is a tool that can be used for good or evil. There's no serious simple answer to this question.

>How do you get into politics or working for the government?

I haven't become too involved yet but based on what I've researched the largest barrier of entry is fundraising. I have some ideas on how to deal with this, but I don't think the solution is to beg for money.

>What are some dumb and stupid things about the Marine Corps or things that the Marine Corps do?

Not valuing NCOs as much as they should. Much like any organization, the emphasis is on those at the top of the pyramid. If you neglect the base, the structure tends to crumble. Excellent Marines get out because they have better opportunities. If we afforded better opportunities to young Marines, they would more than likely to stay within the Corps.

>What was your first birthday ball like?

Pretty boring. I was under 21 so I couldn't drink, and I had only been at my unit for a week so I didn't really know anyone.

>You get a one hour audience with Trump in the White House. No USSS agents, no cameras, recording devices, etc. Just you and Trump sitting at a really nice table with fancy chairs. What do you say to him and what do you do?

I would try to understand where he was coming from in his policies. From the outside, it seems largely motivated by ego, and I think there is sufficient evidence that he is a narcissist. I don't know, people do what they do for their own reasons -- even if they aren't valid for others. Honestly, though I don't think I'd get very far with that conversation.

>Thoughts on the coronavirus?

It should stimulate dialogue on the importance of government cooperation. I think China is hiding the real figures of how deadly it has been, and that is scary. My worry is that when it is all said and done, they will claim that the ability to restrict movement and liberty of its citizens were in the national interest. The really scary part is that it's true -- authoritarian systems sometimes do serve the people, but only in times of extreme crisis (martial law).

>As a country, do you think that we should be more concerned about the coronavirus?

I don't really know what the response has been. I don't know if anything really has been published on what our exact response is, but there's a reason we have the CDC, and I trust the experts that work there.

>Thoughts on James Mattis?

If he were still a part of the Trump administration, I would think very little of him. I think he is a Marine Corps legend and is above reproach. He is a mind, weaponized.

>Lastly, I think that we all know about the bad things/flaws with the United States but what do you think are some unique and good qualities about America that you think should be highlighted?

I think our strength is in our diversity. When dissenting opinions and cultures clash, there is a period of violence and turmoil that eventually gives way to peace and progress. I think we are in that transitionary period, but I have high hopes for our future.

Thanks for the questions! I really enjoyed this."

NBCUniversal, Inc.

Twenty-seven Chinese nationals were screened for signs of the virus after the ship docked in Bayonne Friday morning. Myles Miller reports.

A crew member on a cruise ship that was delayed in New Jersey after more than two dozen of its passengers were screened for the coronavirus was found dead on the ship due to what appears to be an unrelated cause, law enforcement sources say. 
More than two dozen Chinese nationals traveling aboard Royal Caribbean’s Anthem of the Seas cruise were screened for signs of the new virus after the ship returned to Bayonne in New Jersey early Friday morning. Four were taken to a hospital out of caution. 

On Saturday, two law enforcement sources told NBC 4 New York a 54-year-old crew member died on the voyage. Authorities do not believe the man’s death was related to the coronavirus, but are treating it with an “abundance of caution” as they await autopsy results. 

The crew member, a Filipino national, was found in an engine room last weekend, two sources said. His body was kept in a refrigerated compartment until the ship docked in New Jersey, according to the sources. 

His body has been taken to Newark for what law enforcement sources described as a “rush” autopsy. It wasn’t immediately clear when the results would be released, but a law enforcement source said he had no signs of having the coronavirus.

""We can confirm that local authorities were immediately notified after a crewmember who did not report for work was found deceased. We cooperated fully with law enforcement in their investigation and have been advised the death was non-suspicious,"" Royal Caribbean said in a statement.
Twenty-seven Chinese nationals were screened for signs of the virus after the ship docked in Bayonne Friday morning. The virus has sickened tens of thousands in mainland China and killed more than 700. 

Royal Caribbean on Saturday said the four passengers were being tested by the CDC, adding that none of them ""showed any clinical signs or symptoms of coronavirus.""
""One had tested positive onboard for Influenza A,"" the company noted.
The Royal Caribbean cruise ship left Bayonne on Jan. 27, according to the itinerary, and returned Friday morning. It was supposed to depart again on Friday, but Royal Caribbean announced shortly before noon that the trip would be delayed.
The company initially said the cruise would depart at 5 p.m. Saturday with a shortened itinerary, but on Saturday said the departure would be pushed to Monday, Feb. 10.

""We are still waiting on the conclusive results from the CDC from their office in Atlanta, GA,"" Royal Caribbean said in a statement Saturday. ""Unfortunately, due to the volume of tests they are conducting for Coronavirus, they will need the next 24-48 hours to complete the test.""
The cruise said passengers who decide they no longer want to sail will receive ""a full refund.""

Bayonne Mayor Jimmy Davis told News 4 that none of the 27 people who were screened were from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, or had traveled there since the outbreak was first identified. 
No one in New Jersey or New York has been found to have the virus, but one patient with symptoms was awaiting test results in New York City as of Saturday. Four previous tests from Manhattan and Queens were negative"

> A second plane from Singapore to Wuhan took off from Changi Airport yesterday afternoon, carrying with it supplies for the coronavirus-stricken city, and it will be returning with Singaporeans stranded there.

> Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and the Chinese Ambassador to Singapore, Mr Hong Xiaoyong, met at the airport where the minister handed over diagnostic test kits and medical supplies to the envoy.

> Dr Balakrishnan, in a Facebook post later, noted that Scoot flight TR5120 would be ""extra special"" for the Singaporeans who have been stuck in Wuhan since it was put on lockdown on Jan 23.

> ""(The flight) is extra special because today marks 'Chap Goh Mei', a day for family reunion in Chinese tradition. This flight will bring our Singaporeans and their family members back home from Wuhan,"" he posted. The returning Singaporeans are expected to arrive this morning. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that appropriate quarantine arrangements have been made for all of them.

> One likely evacuee is Mrs H, 30, whom The Straits Times previously spoke to after she was separated from her Singaporean husband who returned home on a specially arranged flight on Jan 30. She said she could not join him at the time as Chinese nationals were not allowed to leave Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

> Mrs H and her infant son, who is only a few months old, have been staying with her parents since.

> She told The Sunday Times she and the other stranded Singaporean residents in Wuhan have been waiting anxiously for the second flight to take them home.

> She added that as of 2pm yesterday, none of them had received official confirmation that they would be able to return home or get a pass to go to the airport. ""We are still waiting anxiously,"" she said.

> In the meantime, she has been caring for her young son and passing the time surfing the Web or watching TV. She has been on video call with her husband every day.

That is about Eric-Feigal Ding, and how he is spreading misinformation to boost his social media accounts.

Before 2k followers, last I checked has exploded to 66k followers.

But just think about his behaviour, from what he says, to whom he says it to. If he was an actual virologist. He would be in a lab, doing this research himself, discussing it amongst peers, and then publishing papers.

Instead, we have him blasting ""“HOLY MOTHER OF GOD—the new coronavirus is a 3.8!!!” “How bad is that reproductive R0 value? It is thermonuclear pandemic level bad—never seen an actual virality coefficient outside of Twitter in my entire career. I’m not exaggerating.”

Not only was that information not correct, but is that how you expect a credible scientist to deliver information?

He is pretty much a legit piece of shit, because he is claiming himself to be an authority, and then blasting his new found followers with whatever little bit of sensationalist he can find. He is capitalizing on the very real pain and suffering people are going through, so he can continue to stoke his social media following.

Although I realize that anyone can and might visit China, I feel that statistically Chinese people may have occasion to visit there more frequently than other people, and they may have traveled to China recently.

I hate feeling nervous about a potential health risk that probably has such a minute possiblity here, and I also don't want lack of business to impact my local Chinese restaurant.

A tech company finally admitted the recent Coronavirus outbreak could be a problem. Facebook told UploadVR yesterday that the virus is expected to affect the production and availability of its hardware, which includes its Oculus VR headset line. 

UploadVR originally reported on Wednesday that Facebook stopped accepting orders for the Quest earlier this week, saying that it was ""out of stock."" Facebook then sent the outlet the following statement to explain the Quest's situation:

""Oculus Quest has been selling out in some regions due to high demand. That said, like other companies we’re expecting some additional impact to our hardware production due to the Coronavirus. We’re taking precautions to ensure the safety of our employees, manufacturing partners and customers and are monitoring the situation closely. We are working to restore availability as soon as possible.""

In addition to the Quest, this would presumably impact Facebook's other hardware offerings, like the Oculus RIft S and Portal devices. 

Facebook probably isn't the only company grappling with production issues because of the Coronavirus outbreak, (which you can read more about via the CDC and WHO). But it appears to be among the first to admit that it's having these problems.

Reports about other companies, such as Apple and those in the memory market have claimed that production hasn't been too badly affected by Coronavirus despite the forced closure of some factories. Others have pointed to impacts in Chinese markets."

I’m willing to bet- with China’s refusal time allow our CDC or even WHO to enter the country- that we are talking at least 10,000 deaths and almost 100000 with the virus. Only numbers that large could account for the issues they are having. 
With the number of people in their population- their hospitals and clinics should be dealing with these low numbers of patients easily.

“Every single Chinese person, every member of the Chinese nation, should feel proud to live in this great era,” he declared to applause on the day before the Lunar New Year holiday. “Our progress will not be halted by any storms and tempests.”

Mr. Xi made no mention of a dangerous new coronavirus that had already taken tenacious hold in the country. As he spoke, the government was locking down Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, in a frantic attempt to stop the virus spreading from its epicenter.

 The [coronavirus epidemic](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus), which has killed more than 700 people in China as of Saturday and sickened tens of thousands, comes as Mr. Xi has struggled with a host of other challenges: a [slowing economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/business/china-economic-growth.html), [huge protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-chinese-soldiers.html) in Hong Kong, [an election in Taiwan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/11/world/asia/taiwan-election-china.html) that rebuffed Beijing and a protracted trade war with the United States. 

 Now, Mr. Xi faces an accelerating health crisis that is also a political one: a profound test of the authoritarian system he has built around himself over the past seven years. As the Chinese government struggles to contain the virus amid rising public discontent with its performance, the changes that Mr. Xi has ushered in could make it difficult for him to escape blame. 

 “It’s a big shock to the legitimacy of the ruling party. I think it could be only second to the June 4 incident of 1989. It’s that big,” said Rong Jian, a writer about politics in Beijing, referring to the armed crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters that year.

“There’s no doubt about his control over power,"" he added, “but the manner of control and its consequences have hurt his legitimacy and reputation.”

Mr. Xi himself has recognized what is at stake, calling the outbreak “a major test of China’s system and capacity for governance.”

 Yet as China’s battle with the coronavirus intensified, Mr. Xi put the country’s No. 2 leader, Li Keqiang, in charge of a leadership group handling the emergency, effectively turning him into the public face of the government’s response. It was Mr. Li who traveled to Wuhan to visit doctors.

Mr. Xi, by contrast, receded from public view for several days. That was not without precedent, though it stood out in this crisis, after previous Chinese leaders had used times of disaster to try to show a more common touch. State television and newspapers almost always lead with fawning coverage of Mr. Xi’s every move.

That retreat from the spotlight, some analysts said, signaled an effort by Mr. Xi to insulate himself from a campaign that may falter and draw public ire. Yet Mr. Xi has consolidated power, sidelining or eliminating rivals, so there are few people left to blame when something goes wrong.

 “Politically, I think he is discovering that having total dictatorial power has a downside, which is that when things go wrong or have a high risk of going wrong, then you also have to bear all the responsibility,” said [Victor Shih](https://gps.ucsd.edu/faculty-directory/victor-shih.html), an associate professor at the University of California San Diego who studies Chinese politics."

>China's official health department confirmed on Saturday (February 8) that the new coronavirus can be transmitted through the air.

>At a press conference held in Shanghai, health and epidemic prevention experts confirmed that in addition to direct transmission and contact transmission, the transmission route of New Coronary Pneumonia also includes ""aerosol transmission"".

>Aerosol is a colloidal dispersion system formed by solid or liquid small particles dispersed and suspended in a gaseous medium. In simple terms, aerosols are small liquid or solid particles that are stably dispersed and suspended in the air and cannot be seen by the naked eye.

>The so-called ""aerosol transmission"" means that the droplets are mixed in the air to form an ""aerosol"", which causes infection after inhalation.

    
>Previously, on February 5, the National Health and Medical Commission's website published the ""Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition)"". To be determined "".

>After an interval of 3 days, the aerosol transmission route was confirmed by the official Chinese health department.

>**The difference between aerosol and droplet transmission is the distance of transmission. Both droplets and contact infections occur within close range, while aerosols travel long distances, increasing the risk of contactless infection.**"

I hadn't heard this speculation and all I've heard seems to indicate that coronavirus is a bit less apt for mutations than other viruses, due to copy-checking mechanisms in its replication.

That being said, really dangerous viruses will often mutate to a much less deadly strain as they spread throughout a population. This happens with pandemic influenza strains. Happened with Spanish flu and it happened to swine flu (H1N1) which is now part of the strains of influenza that affect people each year."

I was infuriated with NPR yesterday who cheerily announced, ""Good news about the coronavirus from WHO. 85% of cases not serious."" Do they know what that means? 15% of cases \*are\* serious (which you know good and well means requires oxygen at least if not a vent), compared to about 2% of flu cases. 15% is an  enormous number and one our hospitals couldn't begin to deal with."
