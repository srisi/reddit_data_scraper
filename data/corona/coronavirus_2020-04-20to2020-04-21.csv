A cloth mask is better than no mask. Don't buy N95 unless you immunocompromised, or elderly
Due to hospital shortages and the need for N95 masks specifically. 

If you get Coronavirus, Scientists say its the ‘viral dose’ you initially inhale that determines your viral load and if you're going to die or not. Remember young healthy 20 year olds are dying. If you want to have the assurance of a N95 (95% filtration) instead of a cotton assurance (70% filtration) wear a home made/ Etsy bought polypropylene/HEPA/cotton or air-conditioning/cotton 3 triple layer facemask (99% filtration) and to minimize the initial dose. Even if you wear a cotton single layer (70% effective) you'll only get mild symptoms, instead of deadly...by limiting the initial dose and  anything is better than nothing due to the fact that even if you're young and healthy a large exposure will kill you.

#I recommend buying/making triple layer nonwoven polypropylene with inner cotton fabric masks, they sell some on Etsy. It's the same concept as the
N95, since it sandwiches polypropylene between it's outer shell.

The rest of the whois information is obscured by a proxy organization that provides privacy for whois records (I even use them myself as do many others for privacy reasons), so I cannot tell *who* owns these domains. 

Following the pattern of their sites, I checked for ""reopenmd.com"", but it never resolved to anything. That said, the DNS lookup itself didn't result in a `NXDOMAIN` error which tells me the domain does exist.

Registered a little more than week later with the same registrar. The thing is, they didn't actually complete their whois information this time, and whoever set it up cheaped out or forgot to pay for the Domains by Proxy service. Although whois information is literally a public record, I'm not inclined to place my account at risk by opening myself up to accusations of doxxing. That said, anyone who feels inclined to can go to https://whois.godaddy.com and search for `reopenmd.com`. I myself would be personally curious as to why someone in Florida is registering domains claiming to be gun rights organizations in other states.

Seriously, even without that information - who or whomever is responsible for this astroturfing couldn't make this more obvious if they tried. It honestly took me longer to type all of this up to present here than it did for me to find this all. Yet people have taken the bait hook-line-and-sinker.

> The sudden outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally with more than 1,300,000 patients diagnosed and a death toll of 70,000. Current genomic survey data suggest that single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are abundant. However, no mutation has been directly linked with functional changes in viral pathogenicity. Here we report functional characterizations of 11 patient-derived viral isolates, all of which have at least one mutation. Importantly, these viral isolates show significant variation in cytopathic effects and viral load, up to 270-fold differences, when infecting Vero-E6 cells. We observed intrapersonal variation and 6 different mutations in the spike glycoprotein (S protein), including 2 different SNVs that led to the same missense mutation. Therefore, we provide direct evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 has acquired mutations capable of substantially changing its pathogenicity."

I'd love for them to be right, honestly. But they clearly are not. And if we all do like the protestors, and ignore social distancing, then we will be in some real trouble. It's a shame some people are taking this position of it not being a threat."

Now, I’m not an economist so take what I say next with a grain of salt. This action today, to me at least, raises a rather large red flag. We are entering territory we’ve never seen. Massive deflation. But more massive than we’ve ever experienced. There is just too much production available in the world - for everything.

By ReutersApril 20, 2020, 6:30 p.m. ET
BOLINAS, Calif. — Researchers began testing an entire town in northern California for the novel coronavirus and its antibodies on Monday, one of the first such efforts since the pandemic hit the United States.

Bolinas, a wealthy beach town in Marin County, near Silicon Valley, raised funds to test all 1,680 of its residents, in partnership with University of California-San Francisco (UCSF).

Dr. Aenor Sawyer, an assistant professor at UCSF and a Bovinas resident, said the town is uniquely situated to teach the medical community about how the disease spreads because it lies two miles (3 km) from a highway with no through road.

""So we're fairly isolated, rural, and (with) stable ecosystems right now for the last several weeks. So it will be very interesting to see the footprint of the virus in this arena,"" Sawyer said.

The tests are being offered for free. Volunteers direct the town's residents to drive into four testing bays set up for nasal swabs and finger pricks. The swabs are used to test for the coronavirus, while the finger prick is used to collect blood samples that will be tested for antibodies which can help show who has been infected and recovered."

Anthony Brooks and Phillip Tsai-Brooks married six years ago and were active in their San Antonio-area community.

April 20, 2020, 5:21 PM EDT
A Texas councilman and his husband died two days apart after contracting COVID-19.

Live Oak Councilman Anthony Brooks, an employee at the San Antonio Military Medical Center and a military veteran, and Phillip Tsai-Brooks, a local business owner, died early last week at Methodist Hospital Metropolitan in San Antonio.

“There are two family members we will miss, and will never get back,” Robert Tsai, one of Phillip’s brothers, said, according to NBC affiliate WOAI-TV. “It’s not worth going out and socializing and risking that chance of getting it.”

Robert Tsai said the deaths of Brooks, 42, and Tsai-Brooks, 52, should serve as a warning that the coronavirus can be deadly, even to those who are otherwise healthy and relatively young.

Anthony Tsai, another brother of Phillip's, said he was “in disbelief” over the passing of the couple and echoed Robert’s plea for social distancing in a post shared on Facebook.

“We urge EVERYONE to stay home! Stop the spread! You don't want to go through what we are going through. Rest in peace Tony and Phillip,” he wrote.

The couple leaves behind Tsai-Brooks' mother, who lived with them and has also tested positive for COVID-19, according to WOAI-TV. Alfred Tsai, another brother, told the station that their mother, who is quarantined in the home she had shared with her son and son-in-law, is now forced to grieve alone.

“It’s very hard,” Alfred Tsai, who lives in California, said of his mother’s grief. “We had to arrange for my other brothers that live in San Antonio to stand outside the house while we tell her the news. That’s the heartbreaking side. We can’t go in. My brothers can’t go in and comfort her. She’s standing in the doorway crying.”

His brothers said Phillip Tsai-Brooks went to the emergency room late last month after experiencing shortness of breath and was subsequently put on a ventilator. His husband was at home at the time after being diagnosed with a low-grade pneumonia, the brothers said. Initially, no one in the family suspected the couple had contracted the coronavirus, but by the time the tests came back positive, the two men were getting increasingly ill.

In his final post on Facebook, shared on March 26, Philip Tsai-Brooks confirmed he had tested positive and was experiencing low oxygen levels, a low heart rate, shortness of breath, vomiting and a high fever. He said he expected to be in the ER for just “a couple of days” and would then begin to self-quarantine at home. He died in the hospital a few weeks later, on April 12, Easter Sunday, two days before his husband passed away.

“Tony Brooks and Phillip Tsai loved each other so much, and they left this world together,” Alfred Tsai told The San Antonio Express-News. “It’s a love story that ended too soon in this world, but in heaven, it will last for eternity.”

Live Oak Mayor Mary Dennis mourned the loss of the two men in a public Facebook post shared late last week.

“We are forever grateful for both Anthony’s and Phillip’s service to our Live Oak Community and to our country,” she said. “May God Bless their family and all who were blessed to call both men ‘friend.’”

Since the coronavirus outbreak became public late last year, it has claimed more than 35,000 lives in the United States alone and over 168,000 globally."

I shudder at the thought of you being handed any kind of responsibility over patients’ lives when you think the lives of your own colleagues are so expendable.

Futures contracts are tied to a specific delivery date. Toward the end of a contract’s expiration date, the price typically converges with the physical price of oil as the final buyers of these contracts are entities like refineries or airlines that are going to take actual physical delivery of the oil. 

Futures contracts ultimately are contracts for physical delivery of the underlying commodity or security. While some people in the market speculate on the contracts, others are buying and selling because they have use for the commodity itself. Near the contract’s expiration, traders just start buying the next month’s futures contract. Those who stay in the position to the final day are typically buying the physical commodity, such as a refiner.

The contract that fell more than 100% on Monday is for May delivery, and it expires on Tuesday. With the coronavirus pandemic leading to unprecedented demand loss, and with storage tanks quickly filling up, there is no demand for this oil contract expiring Tuesday. 

That’s why it turned negative, meaning producers would pay to get this oil off their hands because there is no one that needs that oil this week with the country shutdown.

Futures contracts trade by the month. The contract for June delivery traded 16% lower at $21.04 per barrel.

So after that contract expires on Tuesday, oil will be back above $20.

TLDR the May contract expires tomorrow and physical buyers in the US don't need oil and have nowhere to store it. So when you look at the price tomorrow, it'll basically be back in the $20s. The Brent contract for June is at $26 (it was simply rolled forward early so you didn't see this mayhem for Brent at all).

This is a fun market quirk but oil will stay at very low levels for a while as long as there's negligible demand and OPEC+ and shale keep pumping."

""New test: At least 11 out of 100 have antibodies to the coronavirus in the Stockholm area

PUBLISHED TODAY 20:58

**In a new corona test done on blood donors in the Stockholm area, it turns out that at least 11 out of 100 had developed antibodies.** **The actual figure is believed to be higher.**  
**""It's enough information that we can't keep it,"" says Jan Albert, professor of clinical microbiology at Karolinska University Hospital.**

Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet have collaborated to produce a new antibody test in the fight against covid-19. In recent weeks, researchers have conducted test tests in two sessions of 100 persons each. The tests used blood from blood donors. The second round, conducted last week, showed that at least 11 people out of 100 had developed antibodies to the coronavirus. 

Jan Albert is a consultant in clinical microbiology at Karolinska University Hospital and has worked on the preparation of the samples. Tomorrow the tests will be put into operation on a larger scale.

 \- We are happy to have a test that we know is okay. It is not 100 percent sensitive, it has sensitivity of 70-80 percent. Some will test negative even though they have had it. But no one will test false positively. Those we have tested that should be negative have been, says Jan Albert.

#### A good start

The first blood donor test is not a facet, but can be seen as an indication of the extent - even though it is believed to be higher. For example, given the accuracy of the test and that it was only performed on a person who has been healthy from covid-19 for at least two weeks.

\- One cannot draw conclusions about the exact percentages, but we know that the 11 percent have had it. It is too little for a research report, but too important to sit and hold on, says Jan Albert, and says that further research remains.

\- We will continue to get better and better clarity. We will be looking at more blood donors this week. It would be best to have a large random selection, says Jan Albert.

#### One third were infected

Tom Britton, professor of mathematical statistics, says that a third of Stockholmers have already become infected. According to his calculations, the spread is still large, but is slowly declining.

 \- In about a month, the worst spread of infection will be over in Stockholm. Then we will be close to the so-called herd immunity, Tom Britton tells SVT.

Although Tom Britton's calculations do not fully match the tests conducted by Jan Albert, Tom Britton believes that there are no contradictions between the two studies. 

 \- Both studies have uncertainties. If my estimation is slightly high and the other a little too low, it is likely that the truth lies somewhere in between, says Tom Britton."""

The only way out is either a vaccine or a proper exit strategy to contain the virus as much as you can.

They certainly may have to adjust pricing post-coronavirus, but it wouldn’t be up.  That would put them even further under capacity and likely lead to less money than they’d make with their previous $200 price as people would do things like cut back on days (meaning less ticket revenue and less hotel revenue and so on).

I will not be proposing a full education here, merely some hints and references.

Following WW2 the prevailing powers met in [Bretton Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system) and decided the dollar would be the global reserve currency, one dollar being backed by 1/35th ounces of gold. The big society programs and morbid monetization in the 60s caused the collapse of the [London gold pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Gold_Pool), and ultimately a sovereign American default.

Of course Nixon ""temporarily"" [suspending the gold window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRzr1QU6K1o) is not called a default in orthodox circles. But that's what it was. The USA reneged on its promise. That meant the end of the gold *exchange* standard (the gold standard itself had died a few decades back already).

Confronted with an existential challenge, the USA negotiated with the Saudis that the dollar should be informally backed by Saudi oil. Cue the *oil exchange standard*, and the beginning of [petrodollar diplomacy](http://www.321gold.com/editorials/paul/paul021806.html).

What was called the 1973 ""oil crisis"" was not an oil crisis, it was a *dollar* crisis. In other words it was a monetary event.

Followed a bumpy road for the US dollar prominence, with Volcker saving it *in extremis* at the end of the 70s, and American allies agreeing to devaluations in a series of accords. If you don't know about the [Plaza accord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Accord), [Louvre accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre_Accord), it is time to read up.

Following US victory in the scripted cold war, the dollar seemed to have no challenger left. This allowed the Greenspan [great moderation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moderation) years, an euphemism for a historical era of credit expansion, unseen since the 1960s. 

The Nasdaq crash of 2000 and 9/11 symbolically signified the end of that era, and signaled the ""new world order""; understood exoterically as a ""new American century"", insiders were actually esoterically signaled towards the ""new Chinese millennium"".

By the time the 2008 crisis hit, the end of the dollar system had become ""baked in the cake"". That's when powers that be started talking about it openly. That's when the gold manipulation program started becoming admitted (vindicating GATA), and when China started overtly hoarding bullion. That's also when the rumour of Fort Knox being empty was allowed (encouraged) to spread.

The current Coronacircus situation, [as highlighted here](https://coronacircus.com/2020/03/31/covid-19-in-context-subversion-psychological-warfare-and-new-world-order/) among other places, is meant to catalyse the ""fall of America"" and the ""new world order"", that is a world order led by China. But [please](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-18/coronavirus-could-reshape-global-order) don't [take](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/coronavirus-who-will-be-winners-and-losers-in-new-world-order) my [word](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-17/coronavirus-is-making-china-s-model-look-better-and-better) for it.

Trump's ""trade war"" with China, that will culminate in ""accusing China of spreading the virus"", will lead to a monetary conference that will be billed as a Plaza accord 2.0, but will actually be more comparable to the 1945 Bretton Woods conference. China will be ""forced to accept"" that the US dollar be depreciated against the Yuan Renminbi, as ""compensation for the virus"" (as competitive devaluation is being promoted as something beneficial by Mr Donald ""I'm the king of debt"" Trump). He will be celebrating a ""great deal"", and he will be triumphantly reelected.

Will follow a period of morbid inflation for the USA. Soon China will be remonetizing gold. That will end the era of the dollar's supremacy.

What you are seeing today is a symptom of this. This is a monetary event. A *deflationary* event, that [always precede](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2607575-deflation-leads-to-hyperinflation) periods of [very high](https://www.kitco.com/ind/Taylor/2015-03-20-The-Case-for-Deflation-before-Hyperinflation.html) inflation.

It is important, at this point, to realize the USA is undergoing a controlled demolition by a parasite that has chosen China as its new host. The USA, the only country of significant size to have ever been founded on the natural principal of individual liberty, must be humiliated and destroyed. It is a historically productive and industrious country, whose values the parasite and eternal enemy of civilization abhor.

I am sorry to have to tell this to so many well-intended patriotic Trump supporters, but he is not what you think he is. Please look into his *actual allegiances*. I will not spell them out here.

For what it matters: I believe they will fail. The union might not survive, but places like Wyoming or Texas will never be subdued. The blood of Thomas Jefferson still flows in the veins of many Americans.

* Oil is incredibly toxic and difficult to store safely (it generates H2S, a gas which can kill you in literally seconds), and all that storage has become incredibly expensive because it's nearly full

* You can't just dump oil into the environment because of environmental regulations (fully expect to read some stories of nefarious companies doing exactly this instead of paying through the nose to store it)

> Would the vaccine inoculate for life?

Probably not, the guess is on the order of 1-3 years. But different vaccines work different ways and some of the new technologies being developed might be better or worse.

> Would we need yearly boosters? 

If it's a 1-3 year immunity, then yeah, probably. That's totally manageable, though.

> Does contracting the virus actually confer immunity? And for how long? 

Yes, almost certainly (again, the length isn't known, but again, probably for 1-3 years).

> Are we able to make a vaccine against coronavirus? 

One way or another, absolutely. If the immune system can create antibodies for it (which it can), then there is absolutely a way to trick the immune system into doing that, which is all a vaccine is. It may take a few tries but there's dozens of companies trying.

> We haven’t been able to thus far with other corona viruses.

We didn't fail, the outbreaks stopped before they could finish testing. A MERS vaccine was likely effective and safe but you can't complete clinical trials when there's no outbreak anymore, because there's no way to test its effectiveness against getting a virus when the virus is gone. So when you say ""we haven't been able to"", you're technically correct, but it's not for the reason that ""we haven't been able to"" insinuates. If the outbreaks continued, we would have finished development.

> a vaccine is an incredibly long shot...

In his timeline? Maybe he's being too optimistic. But a long-shot on any timeline? That's just not true. It's very likely, we just don't know when.

The person you're replying to may be too optimistic, but you're certainly being too pessimistic. If your threshold for knowing something is ""100%, there's no shadow of a doubt that any part of this is even remotely wrong"", you can't do science. Science is incremental, based on statistics, and gets improved over time. Just because we don't know something for sure doesn't mean we know nothing. We know a lot, and we fill in the unknown details as we go."
2020-04-20,btfjechan85,Brunei,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brunei/comments/g4viex/random_daily_discussion_thread_for_21_april_2020/fo13p3h/,"**Oil falls below $0**

For the first time ever in history, US oil prices [is negative](https://qz.com/1841668/oil-prices-are-negative-for-first-time-ever/). It is $-14/bbl as of typing. Yes don't forget the negative in front. Countries like [Canada](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/0-Oil-Forces-Canada-To-Shut-Down-Crude-Production.html) have shut down crude production.

The good thing is, Brunei doesn't follow WTI Crude prices, otherwise the entire Brunei oil industry might be shut down by now. Brunei Seria Light and Champion Crude closely follow Malaysian TAPIS. At the moment the TAPIS is around $28 last contract.

Bad thing is, a very low WTI Crude prices will eventually force down other global oil prices like Brent and TAPIS. This is how the market works. BSP might sell oil at $28/bbl under current contract,  but the next contract it might have to price it lower. The oil market now is like who sells cheaper buyers will buy from who. Producers are in no position to bargain.

Just several years ago when oil hit above $100, nobody would ever thought it will reach negative today.

Apart from oil the other major Bruneian export is LNG (gas). Last year Asian LNG prices was $4-5/mmBtu. Now it has [fallen to $2.30](https://www.lngindustry.com/liquid-natural-gas/20042020/asian-lng-spot-prices-decline-due-to-coronavirus-disruption/).

Perhaps it is time to think again of a Brunei without oil. I have posted last time it is easy to imagine a Brunei without oil. It will not be Singapore, Hong Kong due to big differences in culture and work ethics. It will be more like Limbang, Marudi, Lawas, Sipitang, Beaufort, Kuala Penyu, Keningau.

Bruneians like to boast about free healthcare, free education, no income tax, etc, more so every time when comparing to other countries. Let's be frank, these are now all at risks. The government cannot keep taking $2-3 billion in deficits every year. It will not end subsidies or welfare right away, but gradually so the people can adjust to it. Electricity is one, higher water cost, higher petrol, higher rice prices might be probable in future. Then it might be free public education only until secondary, free healthcare only for outpatients. These are the possibilities.

Income tax is still unlikely because if an absolute monarchy collects taxes from people, the public will demand greater accountability or even representation.

And if Brunei is to cut its welfare and subsidies, there will totally be no more pull factors to stay in Brunei anymore. For expats, Brunei is where you can save money. If this is no longer the case why don't they go Singapore, South Korea, Japan or top-tier Chinese cities like Shanghai and Beijing. You get to have much more in life there. Truth is there is nothing in Brunei. For citizens/residents, if there is no more welfare why stay in a country with not much to offer (apart from prayers), not much freedom and where you couldn't save much money due to lower salaries.

The world has changed. The first ever negative oil prices brought out many questions and scenarios.. If you are 30s or below it is time to think much further."

The head of the World Health Organization has warned that “the worst is yet ahead of us” in the coronavirus outbreak, raising new alarm bells about the pandemic just as many countries are beginning to ease restrictive measures.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus didn’t specify why he believed that the outbreak that has infected nearly 2.5 million people and killed over 166,000, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University, could be even worse.

Tedros also alluded to the so-called Spanish flu in 1918 as a reference for the coronavirus outbreak.

“It has a very dangerous combination and this is happening in hundred years for the first time again, like the 1918 flu that killed up to 100 million people,” he told reporters in Geneva. “But now we have technology, we can prevent that disaster, we can prevent that kind of crisis.”

“Trust us. The worst is yet ahead of us,” he said. “Let’s prevent this tragedy. It’s a virus that many people still don’t understand"

First, commodities like oil are mostly traded on _future exchanges_, you buy a standardized contract to buy a certain quantity of a certain product at a certain date in a certain place. This contract is called a _future_. It's not directly oil barrels even though it exists on _spot exchanges_ but it's marginal.

This is one of the oldest derivative products. Its predecessor, the _forward_ (the same but not standardized and often over the counter rather than publicly traded), is believed to be as old as writing. Its first use was probably a contract to buy the next crop harvest in exchange of goats or whatever the farmer needed.

The big advantage for a seller is that you sell once at one price, often before producing. So you are unaffected by market fluctuations during the production cycle. For buyers it's the same, whether it goes up or down, you will have your product at said time for a guaranteed price.

Second, as oil futures are for a specific oil sold at a specific place, WTI is not the same as BRENT which is not the same as Dubai Crude etc. WTI is the gold standard of oil, it's very light and low on sulfur. It's very easy and cheap to both extract and refine into car gas. For instance, Venezuela or Alberta crude are very heavy, their cost of extraction and refinement are much higher, they're better suited to make tar.

Third, as noted in the first point, these contracts have an expiration date. Every month on the 20th, there is an operation called _settlement_, the exchange looks at who's holding what and calls on buyers and sellers to arrange for the delivery (paying storage fees, delivering the oil, date of pick up etc.). This day for WTI contracts of May 2020 is tomorrow (April 21st).

Now that you have the basics, let's talk about negative prices. Let's say the world oil production is 100 millions of barrel per day, with the coronavirus going around consumption is way down, let's say 65 millions of barrel per day, the OPEC met and agreed to cut production by 10 millions of barrel per day, not every oil producing country is in the OPEC (the US isn't and it's the biggest oil producer). Now we have an excess of 25 millions of barrel per day. Sure you can store it for a time, but at some point even anchored super tankers will be filled.

This is where we are. We have a daily output largely exceeding consumption for a month or so, storage is full. Now as noted in the third point, the settlement date is tomorrow morning (April 21st). It happens that some traders kept their futures in hope to sell them at a higher price and this morning they realized that they will have to take delivery of the oil if they don't sell before tonight. No one wants to buy oil for now, no one knows where to store it at least for cheap. So these traders sold at whatever price someone was willing to pay as long as they didn't have to handle 10,000 barrels of crude oil themselves.

Sooner today, the CME (the future exchange for commodities) said negative prices were allowed. The cost of storage is so high and the number of people willing to take delivery of oil in May is so low that people **paid for someone to take their contract to take delivery of oil**.

Note that, so far it's a technical event, the price for June and July are still in the 20's, positive 20's. It's a low price for oil and is unsustainable for many countries but unless we get a hold on Xi's disease, oil consumption will be down and these countries strapped for cash."

More cases will be found continuing into the future as spread may have started up to two weeks ago.

The Cargill outbreak started because of outbreaks within some of the long-term care centers. Some workers were infected within the care centers and spread the illness within their large households where there wasn't the room to properly self-isolate. Those households also contained workers from the Cargill plant, who became sick and exposed others at the plant.

Measures were put in place by AHS once the first case at Cargill was identified, but exposure had already happened before the measures; within the facility, within carpools, and within households. Which is why it has caused so many cases.

When has *anything* in life, health or policy ever been 100% certain?

Those uncertain, now-disproven early guesses are the only basis on which you might be able to claim 

> millions of deaths

You can't have it both ways. It's either lethal but not very contagious or contagious but not very lethal. The data is now clear and inarguable. It's no longer possible that CV19 can be both contagious AND highly lethal.

ALL of these new, separate and independent serology studies from Iceland, Scotland, Finland, Sweden, Holland, Boston, Santa Clara, Italy and Los Angeles are now in directional agreement. Three of those were published in the last 24 hours. All of them in the last week.

For example, Mass General Hospital did a random sample of 200 people walking down the street in Boston last Tuesday and got 32% with immunity antibodies. These results are all generally supportive of each other but done in different locations, on different populations, by different scientists using different methodologies. It's ""Replication"" which is the ""gold standard"" of science. The recent RT-PCR studies including yesterday's Ohio prisoner study and last night's Greek air passenger study all support widespread infection that's primarily asymptomatic too. For at least three weeks there have been no new findings pointing the other way. 

Everything we're seeing is broadly supportive of the hypothesis that R0 is high, asymp/mild is massive and IFR is very low and no new information is conflicting with that hypothesis. That's really all that matters because there are only two broad scenarios that can fit the data we have. It's either high R0 / very low fatality or the opposite. Those are the only answers that can fit the data and there's a grand canyon-sized gap between them. All the studies and data are now broadly lining up on one side of that canyon.

More than 300 Amazon employees will call out of work starting Tuesday in protest of the online retail giant's treatment of workers during the coronavirus pandemic.

The call out is organized by labor groups United for Respect, New York Communities for Change, and Make The Road New York and will be the largest mass action by workers yet amid the crisis.

The nationwide protest follows several strikes at facilities in Staten Island, Chicago and Detroit where employees have tested positive to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. 

“I’m calling out this week because I’m scared to come to work and can’t trust Amazon to keep me and my co-workers safe,” Jaylen Camp, an Amazon worker at a fulfillment center in Romulus, Michigan, said.

“We have to make an impossible choice every day: go to a workplace that’s not safe or risk losing a paycheck in the middle of a global recession. Rather than take real steps to protect our health, Amazon would rather stall, lie, and fire the people who speak up. We will not be intimidated. Our health and everyone’s health is too important.”

Over 130 Amazon facilities have had at least one employee test positive for COVID-19, according to the Athena Coalition, which is made up of advocacy groups focused on working conditions at Amazon.

The company last week confirmed the first death of a warehouse worker from the disease, although it remains unknown where the worker contracted it.

Amazon has taken steps to address some of the issues raised by workers, including pledging to increase cleaning and enforce social distancing measures at warehouses.

It has also raised wages for hourly workers by $2 per hour and offered paid time for those with fevers, a common symptom of COVID-19.

Workers say Amazon has not fulfilled its commitment to provide personal protective equipment for workers and that the paid leave policy has not been applied consistently.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the call out."

A future is basically a way for a company to protect themselves from increased costs. For example, if the cost of a barrel of oil is $20, and companies expect that price to increase, a company like Holiday Gas Station might go to BP and say ""I'll pay you $20 for a barrel now, but I don't want you to give me the oil until 6 months from now"". If the price increases to say, $40 a barrel, Holiday Gas Station saves $20 on that barrel of oil. 


Now Holiday won't gamble all of their product on futures, so they're always buying oil on the open market. So a company like Goldman Sachs will come in and buy some of those $20 futures. If the price goes up to $40, then they can say to someone like Holiday and say, ""I bought these at $20, I'll sell them to you for $30"". Goldman Sachs makes a $10 profit and Holiday saves $10 when they buy that barrel of fuel from BP.

Basically what's happening now is that Coronavirus is restricting people's movement, so there's a huge surplus of crude oil, and companies like Goldman Sachs can't find people to buy the futures. Goldman Sachs obviously doesn't have the facilities to store fuel, and there are stiff penalties that Goldman Sachs would have to pay BP if they refused to take ownership of the crude oil, so it's cheaper for them to write it all off as a loss and give it away."

theres a whole market for oil futures where you agree to buy a barrel of oil at some time in the future at a certain price.  but most people trading these contracts never actually intend to complete the sale, they'll just sell the contract itself to someone else down the road and then either make or lose money depending on the price at the time.   and ideally whoever they sell it to will be an energy company who has the capacity to take possession of the oil itself

but at this point nobody can physically store any more oil, so all these contracts which are due in may are now collapsing in value so that whoever is left holding the hot potato contracts has to actually pay someone else to take it, rather than making money from re-selling it.   because for them, if they are unable to physically take possession of the oil in the contract they will get sued by an oil company for breach of contract"

Pointing out that a million people could die globally sounds enormous, but it needs to be kept in perspective.

We keep being told about this overwhelming healthcare thing and yes it might be true in specific hotspots with specific hospitals but even in NYC, most of the hospitals are fine.  Flattening the curve may have been a fine argument at the start, but the goal posts are being moved - we have peaked in the UK, the curve is flattened, hospitals are significantly less full than at the same time last year.  Sweden's experience is that they have peaked, they are done with the virus, they will get immunity by end of next month latest and can carry on as normal, no healthcare system overload, no full lockdown - just sensible measures.  Even in London, hospitals are significantly below 80% full and we didn't even need to use the 4,000 bed hospital that was built.  I understand fully what the implications are, but we now have enough data, and enough is enough, we need to be opening things back up.  We are causing immense damage with lockdown.  500 million could be forced into poverty in the developing world, even if you ignore the effects on our own economies.  This isn't a lives vs money argument, this is a lives vs lives argument, and I could accept it when there was 'some doubt' (even though it was actually obvious from the beginning the virus was not as deadly as stated), but now we have more than enough data to say OK, time to change strategy.

You **really** want to keep people safe? Fine. Then why didn't you suggest this: Everyone over 60 or has a serious medical condition is locked down in their homes for a few months under penalty of jailing in a prison hospital. So those who are most at risk (You do know which demographic is dying in droves due to the Wuhan Coronavirus, and which ones aren't right?) are sequestered and those who are not go about their lives.

Meets you need to keep the vulnerable safe and doesn't cripple the economy. Why aren't you supporting that?"

Registered a little more than week later with the same registrar. The thing is, they didn't actually complete their whois information this time, and whoever set it up cheaped out or forgot to pay for the Domains by Proxy service. Although whois information is literally a public record, I'm not inclined to place my account at risk by opening myself up to accusations of doxxing. That said, anyone who feels inclined to can go to https://whois.godaddy.com and search for `reopenmd.com`. I myself would be personally curious as to why someone in Florida is registering domains claiming to be gun rights organizations in other states.

Seriously, even without that information - who or whomever is responsible for this astroturfing couldn't make this more obvious if they tried. It honestly took me longer to type all of this up to present here than it did for me to find this all. Yet people have taken the bait hook-line-and-sinker.

Meanwhile, the President then starts tweeting [""LIBERATE MINNESOTA""](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251168994066944003), [""LIBERATE VIRGINIA...""](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372), and [""LIBERATE MICHIGAN""](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130); and one of the major forces behind the group in Michigan was a political group that [has direct ties to](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greg_McNeilly&oldid=933829692) and has historically been heavily funded by the family of the Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos (though [said family denies direct involvement in last weeks protest](https://www.newsweek.com/residents-gridlock-michigan-streets-protest-governor-whitmers-coronavirus-lockdown-measures-1498112))?

2020-04-20,mrandish,COVID19,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g4wds8/total_covid19_mortality_in_italy_excess_mortality/fnzwwsv/,"> We combine this with the IFR estimate from the Princess Diamond cruise ship for ages above 70 to estimate the age dependent IFR which range from below 0.1% for ages below 50 years to 15% for ages above 90 years

This seems consistent with the earlier data from [Italian National Institute of Health](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Report-COVID-2019_20_marzo_eng.pdf):

* Median age of fatalities is 80.5. Median [life expectancy in Italy](https://www.google.com/search?sa=X&q=italy+life+expectancy) is 82.5
* Zero fatalities under 30 (as of 3/20).
* 99.1% of fatalities are over 50. 
* 97.6% of fatalities are over 60.
* 99.2% already had one or more serious health conditions (cancer, chronic heart disease, chronic liver disease, etc).
* About half already had three or more serious health conditions.

> We estimate that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy is 47,000

I wonder how they are defining ""COVID-19 deaths"" in this context. Since they are comparing with prior year's all-cause mortality data it's going to include indirect fatalities that may not have had CV19. Due to the massive societal disruption, many things changed that would impact mortality and trigger a forward harvesting effect, including lack of access to medical care (or choosing not to seek medical care), isolation from lockdowns, stress and other factors.

It might be useful to compare this year's excess mortality with prior year's influenza-like illness fatalities to see if there are similar trends for the highest outlier regions (Bergamo etc). For example, in 2016-17 Italy had over [25,000 seasonal flu deaths](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285).

*[Journal of Infectious Diseases, Aug 2019](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712\(19\)30328-5/fulltext)*

> In recent years, Italy has been registering peaks in death rates, particularly among the elderly during the winter season. Italy showed a higher influenza attributable excess mortality compared to other European countries especially in the elderly.

Comparing this year with previous year's influenza-like illness fatalities could help tease out how many might be direct CV19 deaths vs indirect deaths (eg disruption, isolation, economic)."

Here's what Snopes says:

""The Kennedy Center, a major venue for classical performing arts in Washington, D.C., did receive $25 million from the $2.2 trillion federal-relief package to stem financial fallout from the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. The relief package included millions earmarked to support various arts organizations.

The Center also completed a privately funded [$250 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/kennedy-center-announces-250-more-layoffs-in-wake-of-25-million-federal-grant/2020/03/31/461d21ec-72b7-11ea-a9bd-9f8b593300d0_story.html) renovation in late 2019 and received an appropriation in 2019 of [$41 million](https://kcwebsiteprod.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/default-source/pdfs/about/kcpa_fy20-budget-justification-to-congress.pdf?sfvrsn=d9c65d92_2) from the U.S. government in 2019. Both examples listed in the meme, however, are unrelated to funds it received in the coronavirus-relief package.

Furthermore, the Center did indeed furlough workers, including orchestral musicians, even after learning it would receive $25 million from the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that President Donald Trump signed into law on March 27, 2020. However, the Center, which is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, did not then donate $5 million of relief funds to the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Under U.S. tax law, 501(c)3 organizations are [legally](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/the-restriction-of-political-campaign-intervention-by-section-501c3-tax-exempt-organizations) prohibited from making “contributions to political campaign funds.” A spokeswoman for the Center confirmed to us that the organization made no contribution to the DNC and said the Center “has never donated money to a political organization.”

According to a statement from the Center, the organization furloughed the majority of its workforce beginning April 6 through “at least May 10, 2020.” Even with the $25 million federal relief funds, the Center said its financial projections showed it would “run out of cash as early as July. In order to stretch the Center’s finances as long as possible, we must take immediate action to change our expense structure and preserve cash.”

The Twitter user who originated the meme followed up by [clarifying](https://archive.is/YianI) that she meant the scenario as a “hypothetical” and not as something to be taken literally""

The rest of the whois information is obscured by a proxy organization that provides privacy for whois records (I even use them myself as do many others for privacy reasons), so I cannot tell *who* owns these domains. 

Following the pattern of their sites, I checked for ""reopenmd.com"", but it never resolved to anything. That said, the DNS lookup itself didn't result in a `NXDOMAIN` error which tells me the domain does exist.

A future is basically a way for a company to protect themselves from increased costs. For example, if the cost of a barrel of oil is $20, and companies expect that price to increase, a company like Holiday Gas Station might go to BP and say ""I'll pay you $20 for a barrel now, but I don't want you to give me the oil until 6 months from now"". If the price increases to say, $40 a barrel, Holiday Gas Station saves $20 on that barrel of oil. 


Now Holiday won't gamble all of their product on futures, so they're always buying oil on the open market. So a company like Goldman Sachs will come in and buy some of those $20 futures. If the price goes up to $40, then they can say to someone like Holiday and say, ""I bought these at $20, I'll sell them to you for $30"". Goldman Sachs makes a $10 profit and Holiday saves $10 when they buy that barrel of fuel from BP.

Basically what's happening now is that Coronavirus is restricting people's movement, so there's a huge surplus of crude oil, and companies like Goldman Sachs can't find people to buy the futures. Goldman Sachs obviously doesn't have the facilities to store fuel, and there are stiff penalties that Goldman Sachs would have to pay BP if they refused to take ownership of the crude oil, so it's cheaper for them to write it all off as a loss and give it away."

Here's the statistics to date:

Dead: 71

Average age of dead: 79 years

Average life expectancy: 82.5 years

When considering a question like this, a popular metric used is called [Years of potential life lost (YPLL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_potential_life_lost). This metric normalises or adjusts deaths by taking into account the ages of people that have died to get an indication of how many *total years of life* have been lost.

As the average age of those killed by COVID-19 in Australia is 79 years, using the average life expectancy (82.5) as the reference rate, we can roughly determine that an average of 3.5 years per person was lost as a result of the virus.

Multiplying this against the total dead (71), we get 248 years of potential life lost in total. Dividing this by the average life expectancy (82.5) in Australia, we can determine that Australia has had a YPLL-adjusted total of **3.01 deaths**.

Now that we've determined the number of deaths, let's compare it against the number of Australians that are either unemployed or will become unemployed as a result of lockdowns (2.2m to 3.3m, estimated by the Gratten Institute).

Dividing unemployment figures by the YPLL-adjusted death rate, we can calculate that  in Australia **0.9-1.4 million people have lost (or will lose) their jobs for each (YPLL-normalised) coronavirus death**.

Now tell me, is the impact of these two things aligned?

*Edit: It was mentioned that for the purposes of the above that I should use the life expectancy of a 79 year-old rather than the average life expectancy. This is completely correct, however I cannot find reliable Australian data for this. That said, even if the difference between 79 and the reference age was double or triple what I used, it doesn't change the overall point (it might be 500,000 jobs lost per death or something).*"

He is also Research Director, Vaxine Pty Ltd**

An extremely important but still unanswered question is what was the source of COVID-19 virus. While COVID-19 has close similarities to SARS and other bat viruses no natural virus matching to COVID-19 has been found in nature despite an intensive search to find its origins. This raises the very legitimate question of whether the COVID-19 virus might be the result of human intervention.

Certainly, our and other analyses of the genomic sequence of the virus do not reveal any artificial gene inserts that would be the hallmark of a gene jockey, genetic engineers who manipulate or even create viruses by splicing in artificial inserts into their genome. These are generally easily recognisable and hence clear signatures of human intervention in the creation of a virus. The fact that these artificial inserts are not present has been interpreted by some to mean this virus is not the result of human manipulation.

However, this logic is incorrect as there are other ways in which humans can manipulate viruses and that is caused by natural selection. What do I mean? All viruses and bacteria mutate and adapt to their environment over time, with selection of the fittest individuals for survival in that particular environment.

Take a bat coronavirus that is not infectious to humans, and force its selection by culturing it with cells that express human ACE2 receptor, such cells having been created many years ago to culture SARS coronaviruses and you can force the bat virus to adapt to infect human cells via mutations in its spike protein, which would have the effect of increasing the strength of its binding to human ACE2, and inevitably reducing the strength of its binding to bat ACE2.

Viruses in prolonged culture will also develop other random mutations that do not affect its function. The result of these experiments is a virus that is highly virulent in humans but is sufficiently different that it no longer resembles the original bat virus. Because the mutations are acquired randomly by selection there is no signature of a human gene jockey, but this is clearly a virus still created by human intervention.

My group in collaboration with other Australian researchers have been using a modelling approach to study the possible evolutionary origins of COVID-19 by modelling interactions between its spike protein and a broad variety of ACE2 receptors from many animals and humans.

This work which we will publish on a prepress server next week shows that the strength of binding of COVID-19 to human ACE2 far exceeds the predicted strength of its binding to the ACE2 of any of the other species. This points to the virus having been selected for its high binding to human ACE2. **In the absence of evidence of historic human infections with this virus, which could result in such selection, this either is a remarkable coincidence or a sign of human intervention.**

**This, plus the fact that no corresponding virus has been found to exist in nature, leads to the possibility that COVID-19 is a human-created virus.** It is therefore entirely plausible that the virus was created in the biosecurity facility in Wuhan by selection on cells expressing human ACE2, a laboratory that was known to be cultivating exotic bat coronaviruses at the time. Is so the cultured virus could have escaped the facility either through accidental infection of a staff member who then visited the fish market several blocks away and there infected others, or by inappropriate disposal of waste from the facility that either infected humans outside the facility directly or via a susceptible vector such as a stray cat that then frequented the market and resulted in transmission there to humans.

Whilst the facts cannot be known at this time, the nature of this event and its proximity to a high-risk biosecurity facility at the epicentre of the outbreak demands a full and independent international enquiry to ascertain whether a virus of this kind of COVID-19 was being cultured in the facility and might have been accidentally released.""

>I think that the devastation can be extreme and can be far worse than anything that coronavirus can do. I have to quality that statement with the fact that we have never seen that before. So we have to extrapolate from previous economic crisis and economic meltdowns that were nevertheless different. We’ve never seen such an acute meltdown, we’ve never seen such a set of perfect storm circumstances. In some ways, it could mean that maybe we could be a bit more optimistic. If this thing goes away one reason or another, seasonality, the virus disappears, of course that’s a very optimistic scenario, and then everybody forgets about it and goes back to work, one might argue that the damage might not be that severe, however you realize that this is not a scenario that is so easy to imagine, even if all that data is optimistic, even if all the cases start going down the entire society has gone through a stage of shock. It's very hard to convince people to start doing again what they used to do, they will have fear justifiably so, they will avoid lots of things, and it will take time to get back to get back to normalcy even if the virus ""disappears"". There are data from previous economic crisis that can give us some hit to the magnitude of the impact. We know that suicides go up by one percent for each one percent increase in unemployment. And as you know, as of now we are talking about 25 million people filing for unemployment and probably almost 10x as many around the world becoming unemployed, and the number is rapidly increasing as we speak. We know that there is huge problems with other problems of common disease like cancer and heart attacks, they can go up, or actually the trajectory of decrease for many of these conditions are reversed, and they are not decreasing at the same slope or even increase in situations of meltdown. Less people will die because car accidents, but is that really a benefit to be proud of? And then there is other problems, there is all that meltdown of mental health, there’s child abuse, there’s domestic violence, we already see hints that these problems are escalating. Violence in general, we see that gun sales are escalating, and I do really worry about people who are locked down and desperate, loosing their jobs and just feeling completely lost in a world that they cannot understand how it is evolving and why. Its very very difficult to fathom the consequences of what is going on and what we are doing, but I really worry that unless we manage to have a viable plan to exit from lockdown and shelter in place and reopen our world the consequences will be far worse than coronavirus. Our data suggests that COVID19 has an infection fatality rate that is in the same ballpark as seasonal influenza. It suggests that even though this is a very serious problem we should not fear. It suggests that we have solid ground to have optimism about the possibility of eventually reopening society and gaining back our lives."

## Teachers given priority coronavirus testing as NSW school return date confirmed

Premier Gladys Berejiklian has confirmed students will return to school one day a week from May 11 and that teachers will be given priority access to coronavirus testing as six new cases of COVID-19 were recorded across NSW, bringing the state's total cases to 2968.

NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday there was one new case at Anglicare Newmarch House, taking the total at the the western Sydney aged care facility in Caddens to 42, including 14 staff and 28 residents.



Students will return to class one day a week from the third week of Term 2, with the aim of full-time lessons in Term 3.

Ms Berejiklian said students would return to school one day a week from May 11.

The goal will be to have all children back at school full time by term 3.

Teachers will given priority access to coronavirus testing, Ms Berejiklian said.

Students learning remotely from home would begin returning to classrooms from May 11, Ms Berejiklian said, the third week of term two, with a view to a full-time return to classrooms from term three.




NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said schools should aim to have about a quarter of students on campus each day from May 11, ""but how they break that group up will be a matter for them"".

""We are asking [schools] to certainly consider family groupings, keeping siblings together, so that that will make it a lot easier for parents as we transition back to normal schooling,"" Ms Mitchell said.

""We will have extra cleaning, extra sanitiser, extra health provisions, including forehead thermometers and also extra health equipment in our sick bays,"" she said.

""We'll also be asking parents to stagger drop-off and pick-up times, and recess and lunch breaks within our schools. We think that these are important measures in line with health advice that will ensure that everybody feels safe in their school environment.""

In this sample 11% has antibodies and the test detects 70-80% of people with antibodies. So, that leaves us with 14.6% immune. With a population of 2,377,081, that means 347053 people would be immune in Stockholm now, for an IFR of 0.27%.

It could be lower, [if we consider Sweden reports deaths *with* COVID-19, it's not directly clear if those deaths are due to COVID-19.](https://www.thelocal.se/20200414/understanding-swedens-figures-on-the-coronavirus) Additionally, blood donors are thought to be less likely to contract the virus.

As I wrote in my above post, the Stanford/USC team could be correct in their substantive claims. What I and other critics are saying is that there’s a lot of uncertainty: their data are consistent with their claims, but their data are also consistent with much lower prevalence levels.

The researchers should release their raw data so that more people can take a look. The problem is too important to do anything otherwise.”

binomial probability confidence interval calculator](https://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx?id=85) online. This takes into account the uncertainty of whether your random sample is representative of the whole population. 


But then there's the added uncertainty that your positives might not actually be positives due to the false positive rate of the test. We don't know the exact specificity of the test, we estimate it by testing a number of samples that couldn't possibly have coronavirus. 


So now we have a confidence interval for the specificity of the test and a confidence interval for the percent infected assuming the test is perfect... How do you combine those two confidence intervals? This is a very complicated question and one that these researchers are sometimes getting wrong which is why it's important that we see their exact calculations.

My personal opinion - this worry about long-term organ damage is overblown, and considering the massive % of people that end up in hospital with SARS-COV-2 have at least one underlying condition, where we are seeing it, it is probably mostly caused by those conditions, not the virus.  It could also be that people with undiagnosed conditions are being picked up as well.  I'd want that hypothesis thoroughly disproved before I go believing this is some special virus that is completely destroying every organ in the body anyway.

Its really nothing more than 1st responder simulation training - like SWAT training by gearing up with fake weapons and doing a bust or firefighters doing car fire rescue drill. On a large scale, these things aren't done often but on a smaller scale, policies are updated as something pops up that hasn't been seen before. Event 201 is nothing more than a stress test on those policies.

The choice of coronavirus is unsurprising because it was the cause of 2 of the other virology big news events - SARS and MERS. There are also very few viruses outside coronavirus that could cause a pandemic - influenza (but we have a quick way to vaccinate against it) and adenovirus (very, very rarely causes outbreaks and even more rarely causes death), and possibly hantavirus (if it mutated to be able to be transmissible between humans). 

A virus needs to be limited transmissibility and relatively mild to be effective and not kill its self off. From a science perspective, if a virus had transmissibility like Measles (1:12-18) and was as deadly as Ebola, it would kill too many people too quickly and would die off. Viruses that have lower transmissibility and very mild symptoms are most typically common colds and flu. So they had to choose either more transmissible or have higher mortality in order to create a fake pandemic. 

I just glanced at the project and outside the name of the virus, it was about preventing economic fallout than anything else. 

Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security actually does these relatively often as they're a think tank. They did a cool one on smallpox bioterrorism called Atlantic Storm about 15 years ago and another one called Clade X that I've referenced several times. 

I graduated with a BS in Microbiology (human pathogens) and Political Science (International policy) and minored in History of Health and Medicine. I'm also working on my MPH and basically plan to do this type of stuff when I ""grow up"""

That really was the challenge—coordinating between the different agencies, and in that case in particular focusing on getting a lot of help to West Africa, which was obviously the frontline of this epidemic in the fall of 2014. The high-level lessons applicable today are, first and foremost, let the medical experts be the touchstone of the responses—let them be the people who are formulating this strategy, let them be the spokespeople. And, secondly, use every power that the federal government has to harness that direction into effective action, whether that’s getting the right equipment produced and put in the right places, whether it’s getting the right people mobilized and put in the right places. The federal government has vast power to do things if a president is willing to use it effectively.

I was an insecure, white, teenage male. Complete with racist parents who propped me up as ""Better than others"". My father is an incredible narcissist, and a racist, and sees me in him, leading to him putting me on a pedestal of sorts from an early age. He used to be extremely into Nazism, so I assume that, considering, at least to him, since I was an aryan version of him, I was something to be praised no matter who I became!

Like many young teenagers, whether they're white, black, regardless of their gender, I wanted to be part of something. I was introduced to 4chan through internet memes, mainly the MLG Compilations that floated around youtube from 2014 to 2016. This, combined with a powerful superiority complex, both from my parents insisting I was gifted, intelligent, etc., along with the praising of my ethnicity, led me to /pol/, and other reactionary internet forums. 

Trump's announcement, at the time, appeared as a powerful, intelligent, successful, white alpha male stating what everybody had supposedly been thinking. Albeit thinly veiled, I saw the propaganda I consumed on 4chan and other forums being reflected in a presidential candidate, and a ""Successful"" one to boot. I had representation, or at least I thought I did. I was actually among the first religious users of r/the_donald, and I remember being their 75th subscriber, on a very old account I have since removed.

I found myself being indoctrinated into the far-right, and even started watching Infowars. I was a 15 year old, gleefuly espousing the jewish question on the internet, while turning around and pretending to be an economically anxious libertarian in my freshman year sociology class. I was a disgusting human being, and I regret everything I had done. 

As the election came to a close, my interest in Trump very slowly began to wane. My zealous support was cracked by the aformentioned sociology class. My teacher, bless her soul, started to make me question my ideals. I discovered that the so-called ""Facts and logic"" that I was regurgitating in class were easily beaten. I was not Ben Shapiro. I was not capable of taking a podium, talking over the opposition, beating down people below me with a flurry of misinformation and slimy debate techniques. I was on equal ground, the ""Free market place of ideas"", and I was being crushed.

I still remember my parents, at 1:30 in the morning, happily watching the results, as I spectated from behind. I was happy, but not as ecstatic as I had imagined I would be. Part of me thought of the women in my life, the few black and latino friends I had. I kind of felt like ""What have we done?"" was running through my head. That regret seeped into the foundations of my beliefs, and began to rock it. 

Months went by, Trump's administration grew more blatantly corrupt, obviously so, with cabinet picks, with transparent lies being spouted by him and his supporters surrounding them. Over the entire year of 2017, I shifted from a radical right wing reactionary to a centrist. I of course, hadn't informed my parents, but to those I knew, I was mellowing out, becoming more of a fence sitter. Very few of the ideals I held dear in my formative years survived 2017.

And on and on the months went. The more disastrous Trump's presidency was. I was questioning my reality. I was realizing that so, so many people - Both women, black people, and latinos, were more intelligent than me. They knew better than I did. They were more capable and set their minds on more than I had. I was not special. I was not more intelligent than everyone else. I was an equal. My predispositions were not being confirmed by reality, only by the intensely racist websites I read. 

By the end of 2016, I was no longer intentionally racist. Rather, I supported racist policies, and ignored those implications. It was mirrored in sexism. By mid 2017, I was beginning to realize those exact implications were what made me racist, not by me consciously and genuinely thinking that black people or women were equal to me. Actions and policy matter. And I started to understand that. Politics were not a game. Not something you flaunt to show how edgy you are on the internet, not something you paint over a frog and post for giggles, they were human souls being lost or saved, and they led to the bolstering of hatred and monstrous acts across the US and the world. 

I began identifying as a progressive supporter of Bernie Sanders and justice democrats as early as late 2017 to early 2018. From then on, my ideals began to stop being based off of my own insecurities or inflated ego. I have focused on humility and trying not to talk over people in the last few years. This led to obvious changes in my personality, and to my parents implying I was indoctrinated. It only got worse, and over the last year, me and my parents' relationship has decayed to the point of not being tenable. 

I moved out of my parents' house due to frequent abuse due to how I've changed. I never outwardly tried to shout them down with my ideals, but the little things stuck. My parents telling me I'm a ""N***er lover"", a ""Libtard"", a ""Race traitor"", or that I hate America. My Bernie sticker being found, leading to a physical attack and it being torn and thrown in the trash. My eager following of the primaries (I initially supported Beto, then moved to Bernie, now to Biden) being quashed, physical confrontations and constant shouting fits resulting if I dared to even watch anything remotely anti-right wing in the privacy of my own room.

I now live in a 500 a month roommate situation, and work at a grocery store. I start college in possibly June 24th, most likely in September. The only issue is, if I am fired or contract coronavirus, I will be homeless. I am not welcomed back. I am taking a huge risk to avoid how bad the household has gotten - and this was exclusively because I disagreed and stopped being a monster. I refused to continue being that way, even if just to save face. The way my father spoke and had convinced me to speak as young as when I was a toddler makes me ill.

I work very hard to make sure the old me is dead and buried, and that I don't buy into propaganda or hatred. I work very hard to ensure that the policies I support are well thought out on my part, and aren't in bad faith. I believe that Joe Biden embodies them, at least on most fronts. My reverence for purity tests has fallen as the primary has gone on, and I don't think Biden is an evil, soulless, corporatist shill. I believe now, in fact, that maybe it's good Bernie lost the nomination, because more and more I see now that he may have lost the election against Trump. 

So yeah. I fell through a pipeline, and shook the conditioning of both my parents and the hatred I bought into. I am very thankful for how lucky I am, and to the influences that pulled me out, mainly being my sociology teacher, a trans friend I made and reconnected with, and now my wonderful girlfriend and friends. I am going to work my ass off to ensure Trump loses, and with Biden being the nominee, I browse this subreddit, and other neoliberal sources to try and challenge my progressive beliefs. I really, truly, honestly want what's best for people, and I want to have the full scope of knowledge that I can get to achieve that."

More than 300 Amazon employees will call out of work starting Tuesday in protest of the online retail giant's treatment of workers during the coronavirus pandemic.

The call out is organized by labor groups United for Respect, New York Communities for Change, and Make The Road New York and will be the largest mass action by workers yet amid the crisis.

The nationwide protest follows several strikes at facilities in Staten Island, Chicago and Detroit where employees have tested positive to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. 

“I’m calling out this week because I’m scared to come to work and can’t trust Amazon to keep me and my co-workers safe,” Jaylen Camp, an Amazon worker at a fulfillment center in Romulus, Michigan, said.

“We have to make an impossible choice every day: go to a workplace that’s not safe or risk losing a paycheck in the middle of a global recession. Rather than take real steps to protect our health, Amazon would rather stall, lie, and fire the people who speak up. We will not be intimidated. Our health and everyone’s health is too important.”

Over 130 Amazon facilities have had at least one employee test positive for COVID-19, according to the Athena Coalition, which is made up of advocacy groups focused on working conditions at Amazon.

The company last week confirmed the first death of a warehouse worker from the disease, although it remains unknown where the worker contracted it.

Amazon has taken steps to address some of the issues raised by workers, including pledging to increase cleaning and enforce social distancing measures at warehouses.

It has also raised wages for hourly workers by $2 per hour and offered paid time for those with fevers, a common symptom of COVID-19.

Workers say Amazon has not fulfilled its commitment to provide personal protective equipment for workers and that the paid leave policy has not been applied consistently.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the call out.

That means that the overwhelming majority of cases are not actually confirmed via a proper test so there really is no way to know who recovered or in the wider world. 
The only ones bring recorded would be those entering hospital or dying and needing s as cause of death recorded. 

You could record recoveries from hospital admissions possibly but really once you enter the hospital there’s literally only two ways out; you walk out the front door or go out the back in a body bag sadly. So it’s safe to assume that unless you are recorded as dying from the virus then you will recover at some stage. So really outside of that small percentage of people sadly losing their lives to this the recovered numbers are the opposite of the death numbers. It doesn’t really serve much use recording those numbers in detail I guess when the hospitals just need to get you out of the door to deal with the next person. 
Really if you don’t die from coronavirus you will recover and that’s about all there is to it. The only exception I could see would be recording how long it takes to recover on average as that can help with planning of medical care, resources etc."

FAQ

Q: Why is your data different than OP's?

A: I pull my data from the [Ohio Coronavirus website](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/home/dashboard) via a spreadsheet they update daily. That gives different numbers than what OP posts. 

From my understanding, rather than just saying ""we have 400 new cases today"" they backdate some of the cases to the day they likely actually contracted the virus. So the total remains the same, but the daily amount changes. For example, on 4/7 the number of cases on 4/6 was 56. On 4/8 the number of cases on 4/6 went up to 137."

But unfortunately for such idealists, we don't live in the 18th century anymore. The world is more integrated and globalized than ever and it will continue to be that way whether we like it or not. 

We are currently all isolated in our homes right now because an autocratic regime on the other side of the world failed to contain a terribly contagious disease and attempted to cover it up rather than act transparently. In 2001, Americans were reminded how terrorists on the opposite side of the world can still threaten Americans. And we have experienced terrorist attacks since then that confirm that. Mostly Europe, but the United States too, experienced several terrorist attacks and a migration crisis due to the Syrian Civil War and the rise of ISIS. We'll never be invaded by Canada or Mexico but we live in a world where millions of Americans could be killed by any country with WMDs and the technology to deploy them. Our electoral discourse has been meddled with by foreign actors, and these actors will likely continue to be so. Cyber-warfare threatens to disable American power grids or steal or destroy American economic assets. 

And these are only the threats that the United States faces, disregarding the reality that the US has allies abroad that we are strategically and morally obligated to work with. We could try and cut ourselves off from the world and shut out the world's problems, but eventually those problems will become our problems. But once we're willing to accept that reality, then we can actually discuss what foreign policy should be pursued. 

When we intervene in another country, it is almost always under the philosophy that it is preferable to fight the war overseas rather than let the war come to us. After 9/11, Bush realized that the US cannot afford to take a reactive posture to foreign threats but adopt a preventative posture instead. It isn't always easy, but it will often be easier to prevent crises than to mitigate them after they've happened. This cannot be more obvious, as our country struggles to mitigate the current coronavirus crisis without being adequately prepared beforehand. In the case of Vietnam, the US strategy was fighting to limit the spread of communism. If the entire world outside the US fell under Soviet influence, by then it would be too late for the US to defend itself. The Soviets would have had the power to defeat the United States and bring an end to American democracy. In this way, to self-preserve you must intervene or else you will wait until your fate is already sealed. In 2003, when Bush decided to invade Iraq, he did so because he feared the fate of countless Americans if Al-Qaeda managed to acquire WMDs and he realized it was not a risk he was willing to take. In hindsight, we can recognize the intelligence was faulty but what if it wasn't? 

The US has also intervened to defend the American world order and a rules-based world order. It is in America's interest to create a safe and stable world order where dictators like Hussein can't just annex their smaller neighbors or deploying chemical weapons in war, as Assad has done, isn't tolerated. These motivations for intervention are less motivated out of immediate national security concerns but rather creating a rules-based order, that in turn, promotes our national security and the security of our allies."

ur kommentarerna:

**Prof Babak Javid, Principle Investigator, Tsinghua University School of Medicine, Beijing and Consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University Hospitals:**
> We know from common cold coronaviruses that total antibody responses do approximate (not perfectly) with neutralizing antibody responses.  Furthermore, immunity to common cold coronavirus has been experimentally verified with human re-challenge studies (in 1970s and 1980s), and again, correlates with magnitude of the antibody response.  So there is a reasonable scientific rationale that a good serological test may be useful.  What is urgently needed is first of all identifying a high-quality test that is very specific.

**Prof Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine:**

> Dr van Kerkhove (WHO) is technically absolutely correct.  We do not know for certain that someone with antibodies will not be re-infected.  If the virus mutates at a sufficiently high rate, then it will be possible to be re-infected by a markedly different strain.  It is usually the case that even if re-infection with a different strain occurs, then the second infection will not result in as severe disease as the first."
2020-04-20,Flyboy_Will,Coronavirus,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/g4t5ud/daily_discussion_post_april_20_questions_images/fo0rx8r/,"A slightly more important data point is the actual coronavirus statistics.

Sweden: 1,580 total deaths for a population of 10.23M, with 14,777 total cases

Denmark: 364 deaths for a population of 5.8M, with 7,711 total cases

Norway: 181 deaths for a population of 5.3M, with 7,127 total cases

Finland: 98 deaths for a population of 5.5 million, with 3,868 total cases

Per capita, Sweden has nearly the same infection rate as Denmark of Norway but twice that of Finland. However Sweden has twice the mortality rate of their nearest neighbor and nearly eight times that of the best performer, Finland, which interestingly enough has much stricter measures in place.

If you die before being tested, it’s not counted.  If you die at home because you’re afraid to go to the hospital, you don’t get counted.  If you die because of overtaxed medical systems but don’t have COVID-19, you don’t get counted. (IE, you go to the hospital for unrelated treatable respiratory failure, but you die because all the ventilators are in use on coronavirus victims, you died from the pandemic even if you were never infected.). 

The best way to determine the death toll is excess death statistics—how do current death rates compare to the average for the same period.  New York’s excess death figures suggest we’re only counting about 50% of actual deaths, so it’s likely closer to 80,000 have died from the pandemic.

Note that flu statistics you cite are for confirmed *or suspected* cases.  If we only measured confirmed flu deaths, it would be around 10,000 a year.  So this has *already* killed about 4x the flu, WITH widespread interdiction measures, after only a couple months."

If we lived in a system that valued human lifes over money we would have a complete lockdown months ago. Food would be distributed and no one would have to worry about paying rent or healthcare care or anything. People would stay inside, they would have no reason to demand going back to work and the virus would dwindle and die out with minimal casualties. 
I mean damn the best example is my home state Tyrol in Austria. In a very popular skiing resort town named Ischgl there were multiple coronavirus cases. The politicians and ski resort owners knew this but decided not to lock down the town for a few more days because they wanted to make more money, which caused hundreds of infections among tourists who upon returning home spread it all over Europe.

[This article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.zeit.de/amp/arbeit/2020-04/erntehelfer-coronavirus-infektion-rumaenien-deutschland) was published by one of the biggest papers in the country. 


It's necessary to view two problems apart from one another: 

1. The general conditions for foreign harvest workers: Cramped, run-down lodging with shabby sanitary facilities. Those have been the same for decades and are known. Unfortunately, since there are still enough people putting up with those conditions and coming for the harvest, there never was a political need to change that. The asparagus got harvested, dissatisfied harvest workers left, and in the next season, harvest workers came again. 

2. Corona. There are rather strict rules for harvest workers in Germany right now: a. Everyone gets tested for an infection at the airport and all sick people get sent home to go to a hospital instead of work. b. Workers are divided into small teams and must not have contract to other workers in order to prevent the spread of infections that do spring up (this gets mentioned in OP's link). c. Workers are not intended to have contract to possible infected people outside work. This, too, is reflected in this thread's source. d. The workers are supposed to wash regularly to prevent infection. 


Now, the problem additional to the existing unsatisfactory conditions is that there is just not enough oversight to ensure the rules are followed by the farmers employing the harvest workers. It just cannot be excused that there is a lack of soap and facilities. This needs to be reported to the authorities. 



However, the real problem with this article is that the interviewed are scared. The conditions were bad before, yes, but combined with the new rather strict containment rules, one must feel like a slave or detainee. There is very little that can be done immediately to help that. I understand that the officials try to comfort Romanian workers in the conditions by sending the police to check on their well-being regularly and playing the Romanian national anthem, but apart from aborting the harvest, what can be done right now?


I do hope this Romanian newspaper gets into contact with the German media. The regular Johann has no idea in what state of mind these people live and with enough reach, the future workers could have it better. 

That, or this fiasco leads to a shortage of harvest workers in the future which would put some pressure on the right people."

It's OK to have different opinions on lots of things. Tupac or Biggie. Whether pineapple belongs on pizza. The likelihood of your local team winning the league. What the best movie of all time is. Fundamentally, those opinions don't matter. They're preferences, nothing more. You might feel strongly about them, but whether *Moonlight* or *La La Land* should have taken home the Oscar really doesn't make much difference.

Then there are opinions that *do* make a difference: whether the coronavirus is something we can afford to ignore; whether minorities deserve equal protection under the law; whether there's a grand Jewish conspiracy and the Nazis were really onto something with that whole Auschwitz thing. There are numerous things that the Trump administration have done that have made things harder for certain groups of people -- restricting trans rights, making abortions harder to come by, removing healthcare provisions, the whole business when it comes to immigration -- and that's quite aside his traits as a person. It is *absolutely* valid to want nothing to do with someone who'd vote to make your life harder in that way -- or even who'd do that to others.

You're not required to shrug your shoulders and say, 'Well, I guess we're all special in our own way!' for people who are actively using their vote to make your life more unpleasant. That doesn't make you an asshole. It just means you're not an apologist for his particular brand of bullshit -- *especially* if the people in question go completely off the rails with their support."

The controversial shirt was reportedly put on sale on Sluder’s website and promoted on his Instagram account @deadringer. It attracted criticism for its apparent xenophobic and racist design.
.
“Where did COVID-19 come from? Nothing is certain, but we know a bat was involved. Beginning today, my limited edition #quarantees are now available. Link in bio or DM for details… Thank you for your support and sense of humor! #humornothat #batfriedrice”

The post, which has since been removed, also tagged Fleming, Lululemon’s senior global art director, leading social media users to believe that he had a hand in the shirt’s design.

Some noticed that Fleming also promoted the shirt on his Instagram bio.

Among the first ones to call out Sluder on the problematic design was entrepreneur and businesswoman Dorothy Wang, who sent a private message urging him not to sell the shirt. She was promptly blocked.
.
“I was completely shocked and disgusted that people took the time and energy to create such a hateful and racially charged shirt, and were proudly marketing it in hopes of profiting off of the current xenophobia against Chinese/ Asians due to the coronavirus,” Wang tells NextShark.
.
“I was also surprised to see people commenting and supporting something that is so obviously dangerous in today’s climate. I tried to speak to the parties involved privately but was quickly blocked and felt that I had to speak up about it publicly in order to stop the production and distribution of the shirts.”
.
Wang would later reveal in an Instagram Story that the original post was removed, she has been unblocked, and that “parties involved” apologized to her in private.

As social media users continue to hound Lululemon for a response on its Instagram posts, it eventually posted a comment addressing the issue.

NextShark has reached out to Sluder for comment as well as Lululemon and Fleming to clarify if he was involved in the creation of the shirt.”"

Every podcast I listen to it’s brought up in one way or the other. 

I can’t even try to escape into music because I’ve found the past few days that I’ve lost my enjoyment in that because I can’t let myself stop thinking. 

I’ve got asthma. I’ve also got two roommates. One who is deemed essential and is in and out of different places all day. The other one has been working from home for pretty much the last month like me, but she constantly has her boyfriend over (who at least has been laid off himself and only at his house if he’s not here) and she’s constantly looking for reasons to leave the house.

Today I come downstairs to work and I notice she’s coughing and sneezing a lot. Could be allergies. Could be a normal cold. Hell shes a smoker so the cough could be from that. 

But it set my alarms off and now I’m convinced she has the coronavirus. I can’t force her to go get tested, I don’t feel like I can even bring it up.

I feel trapped and scared and I thought maybe writing my feelings out here would calm me down some but it hasn’t. 

My anxiety meds aren’t working at this point, because I’m taking them so much I feel like my body is too used to it and they aren’t working.

Even if we assume that this is beneficial from an economic and public health perspective the amount of people who are willing to drastically slash their freedoms and privacy for a long period of time in exchange for security, especially for a virus with a CFR of 1-3% (which is high but it could be far worse), is appalling. We need to be safe, we need to mitigate risks, but we can’t eliminate risks, and we need to accept this reality. It’s far more important to make sure the virus doesn’t fundamentally change who we are as a society, or we are no better than countries like China.

I know there’s a good chance I will get coronavirus, and I’ll will continue to take numerous precautions, but I’m not going to live my life in complete fear and beg for the government to give people $800 fines for sitting in a park bench.

No vaccines exist that protect people against infections by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, or the ones that cause SARS and MERS. As COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc, many labs around the world have developed a laser-like focus on understanding the virus and finding the best strategy for stopping it.

This week in *mBio*, a journal of the American Society of Microbiology, a team of interdisciplinary researchers describes a promising vaccine candidate against the MERS virus. Since the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak began in 2012, more than 850 people have died, and studies suggest the virus has a case fatality rate of more than 30%.

In the new paper, the researchers suggest that the approach they took for a MERS virus vaccine may also work against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine's delivery method is an RNA virus called parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), which is believed to cause a condition known as kennel cough in dogs but appears harmless to people. The researchers added an extra gene to the virus so that infected cells would produce the S, or spike, glycoprotein known to be involved in MERS infections.

""We know people have been exposed to PIV5, but it seems to be an innocuous virus in humans,"" said pediatric pulmonologist and coronavirus expert Paul McCray, M.D., at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, who co-led the new study with virologist Biao He, Ph.D., at the University of Georgia, in Athens. ""PIV5 doesn't seem to cause a cytopathic effect."" The MERS virus cannot replicate in mice, so to test the vaccine McCray developed a mouse model that mimics human infections. The mice had been genetically engineered to express DPP4, the protein used by the MERS virus as an entry point for human cells.

Lab tests showed that a single dose of the vaccine, given intranasally, effectively caused infected cells to produce the S protein, which in turn triggered immune responses against the protein in the animal host.

Four weeks after the mice received the vaccine, they were exposed to a strain of the MERS virus, adapted to the mice to cause a lethal infection. The MERS virus was also given to groups of mice that had received a different PIV5 vaccine -- one without the genes for the S protein -- or an intramuscular vaccine with inactivated MERS virus.

All the mice immunized with the modified PIV5 virus survived MERS virus infection. In contrast, all the mice immunized with the PIV5 without S died from the infection. The intramuscular vaccine of inactivated MERS virus only protected 25% of the mice from a lethal infection. The mice that received inactivated MERS virus showed above-average levels of eosinophils, white blood cells that indicate infection or inflammation. This connection raises a safety concern for inactivated MERS virus as a potential vaccine, said He. The study demonstrates that an intranasal, PIV5-based vaccine is effective against MERS in mice, said He, and should be investigated for its potential against other dangerous coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

""We're quite interested in using viruses as gene delivery vehicles,"" said McCray, who has also investigated similar strategies as a way to treat cystic fibrosis. Now, like colleagues around the world, McCray and He have both focused their research efforts on SARS-CoV-2, taking a similar tack to working with mouse models of infection and testing vaccines.

Finding an effective vaccine against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is a race against time, McCray said. ""One hundred percent of the population is not going to be exposed to the virus the first time around, which means there will be more people to infect when it comes again,"" he said. ""We don't know yet if people get lasting immunity from the SARS-CoV-2 infection, so it's important to think about ways to protect the population."""

Viral load IS a predictor of the intensity of viral infections in general. There’s a stark difference with the speed of infection here - a 100 particles replicating grows slow enough so the immune system can keep up, 1000 goes that much faster (we’ve all had our exponential growth tutorial by now) and can overwhelm the system. Viral load matters. I don’t make any claims about what the rate of young people dying should or shouldn’t be but you can read these experts:

Prof Wendy Barclay, Action Medical Research Chair Virology, and Head of Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, said:

“In general with respiratory viruses, the outcome of infection – whether you get severely ill or only get a mild cold – can sometimes be determined by how much virus actually got into your body and started the infection off.  It’s all about the size of the armies on each side of the battle, a very large virus army is difficult for our immune systems army to fight off.”

Dr Michael Skinner, Reader in Virology, Imperial College London, said:

“We must be more concerned about situations where somebody receives a massive dose of the virus (we have no data on how large that might be but bodily fluids from those infected with other viruses can contain a million, and up to a hundred million viruses per ml), particularly through inhalation.”

“Under such circumstances the virus receives a massive jump start, leading to a massive innate immune response, which will struggle to control the virus to allow time for acquired immunity to kick-in while at the same time leading to considerable inflammation and a cytokine storm”

Professor Willem van Schaik, Professor in Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham, said:

“On the basis of previous work on SARS and MERS coronaviruses, we know that exposure to higher doses are associated with a worse outcome and this may be likely in the case of Covid-19 as well.  This means that health care workers that care for Covid-19 patients are at a particularly high risk as they are more likely to be exposed to a higher number of viral particles, particularly when there is a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) as is reported in some UK hospitals (https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/22/nhs-staff-cannon-fodder-lack-of-coronavirus-protection).”

From my personal experience in GA, 90% of people who are likely carriers of the virus are not getting tests, so our understanding of the scale is very limited. [Take Richmond county for example, we have nearly 400 positive cases from a week ago and this is not seen in our reporting yet.](https://www.augustachronicle.com/news/20200413/augusta-has-nearly-400-cases-of-covid-19-as-testing-enters-new-phase) This lag in daily numbers and reporting makes a false peak/bell curve flattening exist in the data.

I love this sport. I've paid dues through this whole thing, but it is not smart to open the state yet and I will not be training. The point of the shutdown has never been to eradicate the virus. It has been to give us time to allocate resources and infrastructure to combat it. With these optics and the uncertainty in the scale of the virus, I don't think it makes sense to reopen the state. We still have much to lose and little to gain from reopening.

I can totally understand where you are coming from about the anxiety of not knowing what's around the corner. I am always worried about that too, ""if I'm like this at 26 then what will I be like at 30 or 40 or 50 or 70!!??""  
Maybe you'll sympathise with this too but even with all that's going on with coronavirus I don't feel as gravely concerned as some people are and I think it's because I'm normally under some stress and anxiety because of the pain and the worry associated with it. So when terrible things like this virus do happen (and it really is awful) it's just another bad thing to add to a bit of a list.

He also said that it’s not likely the patients got the virus from other infected people, as they’re retesting positive shortly after having been released. Relapse cases have been detected after an average of 13.5 days from recovery, with the longest reported interval being 35 days. The age and regional distribution of relapse cases are in line with that of the total infections.

I've also seen interviews with Woo-Joo Kim from Korea University Guro Hospital where he discusses this, and the current prevailing theory is that it's relapses or testing sensitivity errors.

PLEASE NOTE - I am not a scientist or healthcare professional, but this is the information I have gathered from reading the journal linked in the above article, and another study about the Chinese restaurant where infection through air conditioning was a possibility. Please read these papers for yourself so that it may help you draw your own conclusions.

The journal above is a compilation of everything that we know already of the coronavirus. It breaks down in more detail how the virus is spread, and how the virus lasts on what they call the ""built environment"" or ""BE"". In the journal itself it says that the main cause of infection is from respiratory droplets from someone who is infected, noting that there have been no confirmed cases coming from fomites, and suggests that fecal-oral transmission is possible.   The journal reccomends that you wipe down high traffic surfaces with either 10% bleach solution, or a 60-70% alcohol based cleaner. Again, information we already knew, just distilled in detail.

In the journals breakdown of ventilation, it in no way states any concrete evidence that Covid-19 travels through HVAC systems, or at least from what I've gathered. Please, again, read the papers for yourself and draw your own conclusions. They use a lot of vague terminology like ""could"" and ""may"" prevent, all without conducting an experiment to see if it is an actual risk factor, or listing a case of Covid-19 being contracted from ventilation.

The journal mentions a study of a Chinese restaurant where they believed transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation. In the study they conclude that ""in this outbreak, droplet transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation. The key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow.""

They also state - ""Our study has limitations. We did not conduct an experimental study simulating the airborne transmission route. We also did not perform serologic studies of swab sample–negative asymptomatic family members and other diners to estimate risk for infection."". 

Of the families that were infected, both of them were sitting at neighboring tables. This suggests that the spread of droplets was heavily influenced by the air flow in the same room. This study does not mention how Covid-19 can spread through ventilation systems in apartments or duplexes through a more complex series of ventilation corridors. 

At the end of this it seems that whether or not covid spreads through HVAC systems is inconclusive, and until a study is done I'm not so sure a deciding factor in whether or not you become infected is leaving the blinds open to let the sun kill the virus like the article suggests. If anyone has any information out there that could prove otherwise, I would be grateful to hear it so that I can adjust my lifestyle accordingly. Again, as I've said before, please read these papers for yourself and take what I say with a grain of salt because I'm not an expert.

The post is a video made by a coauthor of the above Harvard paper, published earlier today, about how to end the pandemic and reopen the economy as safely, quickly, and ethically as possible.

To me, the timeline sounds pretty optimistic—I don't know if we can ramp up the production of accurate fast-turnaround tests quickly enough. But the plan sounds solid to me, even if the timeline gets stretched out. It's basically ""do what worked in South Korea, except since we're starting much later we're gonna need way more resources"", with all the details filled in (we're way more heterogeneous of a nation than South Korea, so it'd have to play out differently in different parts of the country, as the paper goes into). From my position of almost complete ignorance, this seems like a better exit ramp than either ""sit, wait, and hope for a vaccine"" or ""aim for herd immunity by infecting the healthiest 25%-75% of the population in small doses"".

The June WTI contract, which expires on May 19, fell about 18% to settle at $20.43 per barrel. This contract, which was more actively traded, is a better reflection of the reality in the oil market. The July contract was roughly 11% lower at $26.18 per barrel.""

The conservatives will win their “states rights” agenda in the end, but they will overreach with a national abortion ban, or something equally egregious, eventually. The blue states will begin ignoring the federal government almost entirely and work with each other, mostly their neighbors.

It sounds absurd, and it’s not unreasonable to argue that the Republicans will never actually push an abortion ban, but I foresee a change in their leadership.

This process started years ago, when states started ignoring federal marijuana scheduling laws. The formation of interstate compacts to coordinate coronavirus response is another step down this road.

The south, southwest, and Midwest will be their own flavors of dystopia.

I predict that in 50-100 years there will be full on chattel slavery in the South again. The thirteenth amendment loophole will be used as a pretext to begin outright enslaving and trading in people. The social transition from indentured servants to slaves happened gradually before using similar pretexts; slavery evolved out of the extension of indentured as a form of punishment."

All you state one tidbit of personal experience. Which, is a small bit of evidence, I guess, but nothing to prove your above claim.

But I digress. For the majority of people, staying at home in the long run will not be healthy. Millions have already lost their jobs, and millions more are coming if we keep the lockdowns in place, [at a rate of 5 million per week](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/16/coronavirus-unemployment-claims-numbers-190026). If that keeps up at even a fraction of that rate, what will unemployment look like in just a few weeks or months? Many of those families will have children to support, nonetheless themselves. Where will the money come from? How will they feed their families? And how long will it take them and their businesses to recover after the lockdown, if at all?

[The mortality rates were likely overestimated as well for all populations - antibody tests are showing that much more people may have come in contact with the virus than previously thought](https://off-guardian.org/2020/04/19/watch-covid19-fatality-rate-in-the-ballpark-of-seasonal-influenza/). It's probably not nearly as dangerous to take a stroll through the local grocery store than previously believed. Mental health will also inevitably decline, causing things such as suicide rates to increase.

In summary, the stay at home orders , if prolonged for another few weeks, will cause FAR more harm to not ONLY the elderly and the vulnerable to coronavirus, but the millions of normal, healthy individuals who would otherwise be living life as normal right now. That is my, and in general this subs issue with the lockdown. I'm not arguing that there WONT be any harm if we open up with proper precautions - a second wave is inevitable, regardless of what we do. But we also cannot stay on lockdown forever for the reasons mentioned above."

This article says the fund was exhausted in 13 days and suggests the money went to corporations larger than the program was supposed to allow. Specifically, qualifying companies were supposed to have less than 500 employees, yet Shake Shack qualified for $10M in loans since each of their locations had fewer than 500 of their 7600 employees. The article also mentions many companies who qualified had very strong cash flow, suggesting the money was not needed. Overall, 30% of the funding went to 2% of the applicants.

There is little in the article to defend the disbursements. Shake Shack has said it would return the money. President Trump has generally touted the program as a success. The article also states that many of the companies mentioned refused to comment.

We wanted to share some information with you regarding temporary changes to the Velocity program and what this means for you.
You may be aware that some of the Virgin Australia Group companies have entered Voluntary Administration. Deloitte has been appointed as the administrators, meaning they have assumed responsibility for the business and operations of those companies in administration.
The intention of the administrators is to bring the relevant Virgin Australia Group companies out of administration as quickly as possible and return to normal operations.
Although Velocity is owned by the Virgin Australia Group, it is a separate company and it is not in administration. That means we’re still operating, but we’ve made some temporary program changes in the interests of members.
We’ve made the difficult decision to pause all redemptions for an initial period of four weeks, effective immediately. This means you won’t be able to redeem your Points for rewards during the pause.
We know how much you love to plan your travel and use your Points to redeem flights, however the ongoing travel restrictions and reduced flights have limited the options for you to use Points for flights. We’re seeing more members use Points to shop online for items such as gift cards, electronic goods, and wine. This unexpected demand has made it difficult for our suppliers to provide these offers and limits the availability for all members to redeem their Points.
What you need to know:

Your Points aren’t going anywhere. They will remain in your account.

Your existing Points will not expire through this period. We will be extending the expiration period for your existing Points by the timeframe of the pause.

You can continue to earn Points with our partners, although you won’t be able to redeem them during the pause.

These changes take effect immediately. Although the initial timeframe for this restriction is four weeks, this period may be extended. We will come back to you with an update as soon as we can.

What’s next?
Velocity has a trustee in place to look after the interests of members. We will continue to assess a range of options for the program and we want that to include a continuation of our long-standing partnership with Virgin Australia.
We thank you for your patience, loyalty, and understanding in these challenging times.

Scroll down to Case Map.

Under 'United States,' click ""Death/10M"" to see the per capita death rate from the disease.

New York is at the top because it has unmatched population density, and Illinois is similar because of Chicago. Louisiana is really high due to, probably, Mardi Gras happening right before social distancing was ordered.

I'm in Georgia, and the southwestern rural areas have the highest per-capita death rates. Not sure why. Might be poor access to the necessary healthcare, or a disregard for social distancing.

In any case, the disease is serious enough that we need to take these sorts of precautions to save tens of thousands of lives. If you want to make a difference, contact your representatives and senators, and maybe organize a group phone or letter-writing campaign, demanding we spend more to set up contact tracing and testing. 

That's what's going to let us safely end this. Once we implement that, the stay-at-home orders will slowly be lifted. If we have testing and contact tracing in place and *any* place keeps a stay-at-home order in effect once the transmission rate gets to a safe level, I'll gladly join in protesting."

There are undoubtedly technical and possiblly legal issues that made tokens incompatible with YouTube. The last we heard is that they're working to find a way to make tokens available again. It probably comes down to creating a new system from scratch.

Remember how long it took for Twitch to award those tokens? It didn't start until halfway through the Inagural Season. And viewers in many countries were not eligible due to the privacy and gambling laws in those countries. The number of countries was expanded.

And now the coronavirus lockdown is probably slowing down implementation of the new system, because everyone at Blizzard and YouTube  is working from home, if at all.

And that's assuming the company lawyers have an agreement about who owns the viewer data, who is allowed to do what with them, who should pay who how much, and if privacy laws governing both companies are not being violated.

The state now has the third-highest number of COVID-19 cases in the country, with 38,077 positive cases--- behind New York and New Jersey respectively.

“We’re right in the middle of the surge now,"" the state's Republican governor, Charlie Baker, said Sunday on CBS News' “Face the Nation.""

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose state has battled through the worst of the pandemic with overflowing hospitals, overcrowded morgues, and overwhelmed funeral parlors and gravesites to accommodate the massive death toll of 18,609 people, vowed to send 400 ventilators to support Massachusetts.

In New York, the number of daily hospitalizations and deaths has finally begun to fall, but Massachusetts has seen a surge in recent days and is expected to surpass 2,000 deaths this week.

On Monday, two additional field hospitals were opened in the state, joining two other sites that have been up and running. A fifth one is expected to open in about a week.

Vice President Mike Pence said the White House is closely watching the Boston area, and the coordinator of the federal coronavirus task force, Dr. Deborah Birx, said officials are “very much focused” on Massachusetts.

In some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods, many of which are densely populated with houses crowded together in minority communities, authorities are urging people to stay indoors and practice social distancing but warmer temperatures have tempted some to abandon rules of caution.

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh warned that violators congregating in parks and outdoors would be sanctioned by law enforcement if necessary.

""We won’t hesitate to send police officers to deliver the message and -- if necessary -- deliver citations,"" Walsh said in a statement on Twitter.

The city has also outfitted at least seven public work trucks with speakers that are circling hard-hit neighborhoods broadcasting messages about social distancing, washing hands and covering faces in seven different languages."

The actual findings of the study: 1.5% of people tested had a positive antibody test. However, the test they used has a false positive rate between 0.5-1.8% (95% confidence interval). Within the normal workings of science, that would not meet the bar to say that we detected ANY positive Covid-19 antibodies as there is a reasonable chance that they were all false positives. [The post where a stats professor says the authors should apologize](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/04/19/fatal-flaws-in-stanford-study-of-coronavirus-prevalence/) has a ton more detail, but the point is, their conclusion is not supported by the data they have.

Additionally, the sample was based on people responding to a Facebook ad which specifically mentioned Covid-19. One might reasonably suspect that given the lack of access to testing in the US that people who thought they had Covid-19 might be overrepresented in the sample. One could reasonably adjust for that using their symptom history (which is data they took), but they don't actually seem to do this.

Finally, if the study is more accurate than people give it credit, there are some interesting implications. If the mortality rate is actually 0.12-0.2% as they suggest, then the 10,000 deaths in NYC mean there have been 5-8.3 million infections in NYC, which has a population of 8.4 million. That would put NYC well into the downward part of herd immunity but new cases have been reasonably flat for a while now. Additionally, it would mean that S. Korea, which has an aggressive testing and contact tracing program missed 100,000+ infections, despite seemingly having very good control over their outbreak."

A lot of people there ate up the Stanford study that implied a rate of 0.1%... even though the study was super flawed and not for the purpose of estimating fatality rate.

You would think a science based sub wouldn’t get so many upvotes on sentiment based comments unless most people on there... weren’t of a science background. Like why do I see comments with dozens of upvotes that extrapolate antibody studies from a very niche German town to the whole USA?

Good things: multicenter trial is really important and it’s really good that they did so here; also appreciate that they had a pretty robust list of matching criteria. Effect size is large enough that it’s plausible there’s a clinically significant effect.

However: Methods leave a LOT to be desired about describing the selection criteria, which I’d like to see more about — it’s hard to assess generalizability without that.

Mortalities are really really good — unusually good — for both the treatment and non-treatment groups, especially in the group requiring mechanical ventilation, which makes me a significantly more concerned about generalizability. Possible that the selected group was less sick and more likely to respond to ivermectin than general population.

Table 1 looks pretty good — if anything, maybe the ivermectin group was a bit more susceptible? Not by much though. Love the demographic diversity, that’s helpful. Maybe a demographic breakdown of results would be helpful, especially in light of recent findings that individuals of some races have more significant disease burdens than others? Probably a bit premature at this point, might be more interesting down the line in RCTs.

Figure 1 appears mislabeled by a factor of 10? That’s just sloppy.

Text of discussion refers to the role of ivermectin on importins — I’ll have to read more about that, seems odd, not sure why nuclear transport would be relevant for a coronavirus (or really any non-retrovirus positive-sense RNAs), so I’m skeptical but not inherently dismissive.

Remainder of the text isn’t all that illuminating.

Overall: Interesting study. Results seem surprising but fascinating and potentially worthy of further exploration with RCTs, as the authors themselves note. However, concerns about patient selection makes it difficult for me to get too excited about this just yet."

I don't think any of us have ever seen anything like this. the oil companies are running out of space to store the oil and have to pay to have it stored.

I assume this situation is temporary, but no one knows for how long the effects of the world wide lockdown will linger.

China, which is a net buyer of oil will benefit on this measure. Even as it loses substantial amounts of its exports. Thing is, which is what people can't get heads wrapped around, is that China's population is huge, and for some time now China had been encouraging its internal consumer markets. They can most probably weather the storm for many months longer, even if their export markets become more tilted to Asia. I'd be surprised if they were not planning for just such an eventuality.

The US however, may see its trade balance become ever redder, as oil revenues and other exports take a hit.

In any case, I expect this Coronavirus pandemic to exacerbate the inequality already built into the economy. Showcase the many systemic weaknesses of a Capitalist system propelled by consumerism.

Over where I live, in a red state and a semi-rural area, there's more and more talk of ""going local"". Indeed there's much co-operation and good will on the local level and a huge cynicism about the federal/national level, which is seen as a cesspool of toxic divisions. This attitude goes far beyond red/blue divides too, which is kind of interesting. left and right they heap praise on the competence and organization of local providers, from healthcare workers, to hospitals to small business owners.

Viruses infect people at exponential rates.  Viruses keep infecting people until they reach a limit where there isn't anyone else to infect. Without a vaccine, stay at home/shelter in place orders prevent people from bumping into each other as much and spreading the virus around) and slows the rate of infection but here's the key thing: those measures don't eradicate the virus.  

Once people start bumping into each other again, the rate of infection will increase and deaths will increase again.

Places like China and South Korea where they did extreme contact tracing and supported isolation of those infected were able to quash down the rates of infection even more, but once these countries start allowing external travel from outside their zone and once they relax and let up on all the containment measures, there will be other waves of increased infections/deaths.

Influenza annually infects about 10 percent of the global population. The coronavirus is twice as infectious as the regular flu. Let's say that 20 percent of the global population eventually becomes infected over the course of one year, without serious permanent social distancing containment measures.  That's 1.6 billion people (roughly) infected.  If the case fatality rate is 2% that's 32 million who may die, eventually over the course of a year (or slightly longer if they stretch out the pace with intermittent social distancing measures (on/off).  Compare these numbers to 80 million who died over the course of 6 years for WWII.   If the case fatality rate for COVID is actually 1% then it's only 16 million that may die.  Compared to the 600,000 that die annually for the regular flu.

Phase 1 allows some gyms to reopen but only with strict limitations, including social distancing considerations (6 feet distance, face coverings, etc).  Things have to reopen but it is going to be a phased reopening with the ability to return to higher levels of shut down.  We aren’t trying to make the virus go away with the quarantine.   We are trying to slow it a bit so the health care system is able to keep up with patients.  If we are significantly under health care capacity in some areas then they should be opened up slowly.  There are two ways out of this, gain herd immunity or hope and pray for a vaccine which may or may not work.  All of us will probably contract the thing eventually.  Like I said, the lockdown is mostly about keeping the healthcare system from being overwhelmed.  It’s not about stopping the virus.       If the health system has capacity (and most outside of the hottest areas are actually losing money due to little Covid and no elective procedures), then stuff should be slowly opened.  Now, seeing what I’ve seen in my lab... I’m not going to train until a workable vaccine is out or I get it some other way and (hopefully) gain immunity.  One factor to the severity is definitely the initial inoculate size.  BJJ is a good way to get a huge inoculate.  But no, under none of the federal guidelines (which you can see repeated daily at the coronavirus task force press conferences) would BJJ gyms be allowed to open right away.  That said, state governors are allowed to run their states how they see fit (because that’s how the USA is set up), so some might do it differently especially in areas with little to no exposure.

Best case scenarios:  

1.	 You contract it with a very small inoculate and don’t have any other factors that contribute to it being super bad (no one really knows why some people are asymptomatic while others get full blow bat AIDS).  
2.	 You somehow get super lucky and bunker down for 18 months without contracting it and then get a working vaccine.  


That’s really the only 2 outcomes that don’t suck and allow us to get back to training 🤷🏽‍♂️"

I don't love DHT because they already contracted out a lot of their fleet for long-term storage, and at only moderately gouging prices.  Need to learn more about TNK and FRO (though it looks like those entry points have become unattractive.  Shame on me for missing them yesterday and this AM).

NAT (around $5) comes with a .14 dividend ex-5/22, which I'm going to consider a discount on the purchase price.  If I were to hold it past May, that becomes a yield of 11-12% depending on entry point.  NAT is announcing earnings on 5/18.  This is expected to be the first quarter in a long time with solid earnings and cash flow, even though it's mostly before the massive tanker rental price increase.  Analysts haven't touched their EPS estimates for the quarter, year, or 2021 yet ***at all***.  Debt exists, but is manageable and being paid down, and free cash flow is increasing bigly.  They could probably use some free cash to retire more debt and will definitely return some to shareholders.

What's amazing is this is mostly the situation **before** the oil glut and coronavirus pandemic!  Tanker rental rates have skyrocketed, which is going to megacharge earnings and free cash flow, for at least the next few months (is two quarters too much to ask for?).  Tankers sheltering in place reduces expenses slightly as well.  With lending rates so low and strong assets to back up the business (\~1.3billion to about 400 mil in debt), I could definitely see new debt being issued to retire old debt at lower rates.  I wouldn't be shocked to see an increase in dividend, as even in loss-making quarters NAT has shown an extreme dedication to returning value to investors through dividends.

There's going to be a lot of very, very good news coming for this company in the next month, both rearward- and forward-looking.  They got their shit figured out just in time to take advantage of these incredible ~~generational~~ first time ever conditions (we've never seen oil in super contango like this, ever, in the history of oil).  I easily see NAT trading up to their 8ish year highs in the mid-teens within the next few months.  Yes, the hype might bring this stock into overweight territory and oil will eventually stabilize.  That's the whole ""sell high"" part of the equation.  It's tough to see a situation where I'm still holding this stock six or nine months from now, but it's gonna be a great ride into the summer, and I think the value of holding NAT outweighs playing it with options.  I'm also gonna play some options on it too, because WTH.

&#x200B;

Yeah, some of the first few NAT leases are trash, but the beauty is that they're short term.  Some of the later contracts are straight $$$$$$$$.  DHT is locked into $67,300/day for 12-18 friggin months.  NAT, OTOH, says ""\[w\]e have concluded contracts of longer duration than above,"" above being 60 days, to capture price increases using shorter contracts.  Since they were smart enough (smarter than DHT) to stop signing long-term contracts, hopefully they'll see when prices start to plateau and switch to signing long-term.  This was in March.  When oil prices still suck in mid-May (i.e. 60 days), DHT is going to be entering into new contracts. In March, even before oil got absolutely shitfucked to oblivion, they had deals on tanker time leases as high as $110,000/day.

For example they have never observed asymptomatic transmission in coronavirus, and I believe the way it remains alive in surfaces and air surpasses most coronaviruses.

Regarding antibody levels after infection, this is extremely serious, as it will lead to reinfection or reactivation.

My understanding is for that to happen, the adaptive immune system is failing. Now the innate immune system can help you fight the virus, but that would mean the next time you get infected it will be like the first time.

I don’t understand what it could lead this to happen. In HIV this happens because the antibodies are autoimmune, and thus the body inhibits those antibodies from being made, but my understanding is that we still develop antibodies, although they are not broadly neutralizing, since other strains can still reinfect you.

Another possibility is that the assay has limitations. That means they are using an antigen that is not binding to the antibodies. This could happen if you use one stain of the virus, and people that were infected with another strain, are producing antibodies that are not reactive with the strain being used in the assay.

This is also a big red flag, meaning that multiple strains can infect you, and there’s no way to build herd immunity. Also that would mean a vaccine would be useful only if it can induce a broadly neutralizing antibody response, otherwise it will be like the flu but worse. You will need a shot anytime this virus mutates, and it’s possible it can mutate so much, that a vaccine will be obsolete.

Either way there’s nothing good about this post. The only thing we can hope is that this assay has some limitations and the data is wrong, otherwise I fear we won’t have any answers anytime soon, and we may look at a prolong period of isolation."

Mostly due to collapsed demand—fuel demand is down 70% worldwide. That’s a coronavirus thing. The other issue is that there’s WAY too much being pumped. OPEC+ isn’t cutting back 10 million bpd until May and there’s already nowhere to put the oil: world storage capacity is over 70%. That’s why the futures went “negative” (selling cheap contracts for more expensive later contracts because the buyers have nowhere to put it).

For every month from Jan. 2000 to Dec. 2019, the chart shows all deaths that occurred in New York. You can see the annual spikes due to flu complications, the rise in heart attacks around the holidays, etc. You can see the massive spike in September 2001, with the terrorist attacks that killed 3000 people.

The chart doesn't have the full number of deaths from all causes for the past few months. But they included just the number of Covid-related deaths claimed in March 2020. And you can see that it just blows everything out of the water.

Even if half of those deaths were secretly from other causes, the fact that there are just *so many more* of them than there were due to Sept. 11 means that *something* big is happening in New York right now that is killing lots of people. If they don't think it's Covid, then ask them what they think is *new* and killing twice as many New Yorkers as 9/11."

Here’s an article from 2004 which hints at how hard it is to work at developing a vaccine for any coronavirus:

Relevant quote:

“Unfortunately, despite long-term efforts, effective vaccines to prevent enteric CoV infections remain elusive, and generally live, but not killed vaccines, have induced the most consistent protection against animal CoVs. “

This whole notion that we just need to wait 12-18 months for testing a safe vaccine presumes we can develop one quickly like a flu vaccine.  This is not the case. Coronaviruses (4 of which affect humans) have never been vaccinated against because we haven’t been able to make one.

2020-04-20,anhonestscribbler,redscarepod,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/g53y8b/multigenerational_homes/fo1liis/,"My younger sister left Brooklyn for Miami to live with my mom and 89-year-old grandma. My mom's lived with my grandma for the past two years or so out of economic necessity (foreclosed house because of the '08 crash; crushing credit card debt and a bankruptcy; precarious work as a freelance graphic designer and a substitute teacher; lost work followed by more crushing debt; the works). My sister and my mom are like Lady Bird and her mom. It's uncanny, though I'd say my mom is much more maternal in comparison.

Like you, the overarching anxiety is with someone in the family passing it on to my grandma. My sister, paranoid as hell about being in Brooklyn as things went to shit, canceled her flight and took a train down to Ft. Lauderdale from Penn Station instead. She stayed with my other sister and her husband in their cramped apartment while recovering from a cold. My mother, maternal and foolish, took my sister to get tested for coronavirus and, without waiting for the results, took her back to my grandmother's. My sister stayed in the guest room without leaving, other than to go to the bathroom with masks and gloves. The results came back negative, thank God, but I was still angry at my mom for taking the risk.

Things have been okay with all three of them. My grandma enjoys having my younger sister around, and my mom, who more than anyone else I know gets her purpose out of being a mother, loves having her daughter around.

My grandma's house is a modest single-story home in a working-class neighborhood. She doesn't speak a lick of English. I don't expect a lot of her neighbors do either. Growing up, my mom took out a mortgage for a house she couldn't afford so my sisters and I could attend one of the best public schools in the country. My classmates (Colombian, Venezuelan, or Jewish, but all upper-middle-class) often joked my grandma's neighborhood was ""ghetto"" and ""sketchy,"" but I always saw it as nice. A decent place to raise a family but nothing to brag about. It's amazing my grandparents raised five kids in that house. It must have been so cramped. Still not so cramped that my aunts and uncles fled South Florida when they started families. All of them live within thirty minutes away from my grandma's house. My uncle, who works near MIA, not ten minutes away from my grandma, would often take his lunch break at her place as she's always cooking great food. For all her life she's seen her children most days of the week. Though that contact's been restricted, at least she sees my mother. All seemed good until...

Coronavirus began spreading more in Miami and Ft. Lauderdale. For the past year, my mom's worked as a receptionist at an engineering firm that focuses on construction. Because they're in construction, they're a necessary business. When shelter-in-place became a reality, my mom's business stayed open. Her employer wouldn't let her work from home

There's something I left out: my mom is pushing sixty and obese, if not very overweight. Because of her financial straights, she's not been to the doctor in years. Hard-headed as ever, she wouldn't go when she got insurance too.  The past several weeks have been a fight between her and my sister and me about when she should go out and in what settings. I've been the most successful at calming her down over the phone, reminding her of the risks she is taking, telling her what she can do to minimize them, reassuring her that though what she's doing is difficult, it's easier than a stint in the hospital or death. Two weeks ago she took time off from work, fearful of catching the disease. A week later, her employer begged her to come back but refused to make her coworkers wear masks at work so she could be safe. She's now out of a job

How much family matters came into sharp relief, but it's hard to not focus on the economic devastation of this disease. For the life of me, I don't understand people who mock others who wish to get back to work, misguided as they are. Doubly so for those who say all of this is fake and doesn't matter. For my mother and other men and women who were fucked by a poor health care system and predatory home lending practices, coronavirus and the shutdown is destroying their small dream of pooling together enough money so they don't have to work until they hit the grave

I'm lucky enough to still have a well-paying job. I'm giving my mom my stimulus check, and saving enough money to help her out when she needs it, even though she'll never tell me that she needs it. Hopefully, when she reaches retirement age, she could even move in to take care of whatever future kid I have. But not a lot of people have that backup plan at all"

>He leads the emergency department in the hospital and is the responsible crisis coordinator for Covid-19 patients. In the clinic, doctors have treated dozens of coronavirus sufferers in recent weeks, from symptom-free spreaders to intensive care patients on the heart-lung machine. 

>**Among them were six active divers, all of whom did not have to be treated in hospital, but cured themselves in home quarantines. All of them were not severe cases, their illnesses were five to six weeks ago and they are considered to have recovered.**

>**But they can no longer dive. ""The damage to the lungs is irreversible,""** said Hartig in an interview with the APA.

>**And this despite the fact that they were considered clinically healthy after several weeks of control and showed only individual symptoms such as a coughing or reduced physical fitness.**

>**""This is shocking, we don't understand what's going on here.**

>They are probably lifelong patients, so it doesn't matter whether they dive again or not,"" said the doctor. 

>The bad news was made clear by lung CTs. ""They didn't get any better at all in imaging,"" said Hartig. ""As an emergency doctor with 20 years of experience, you swallow when you see something like this in a 40-year-old patient.""

>In the control after several weeks, two patients showed significant oxygen deficiency when under stress as a typical sign of persistent lung shunt. In two, the bronchi were still very irritable when under stress, as in asthmatics. Four out of the six divers still showed impressive lung changes on the control CT. ""I even called on the X-ray to see if they had swapped the pictures because a healthy patient was sitting in front of us,"" said Hartig.

By Dana Thomas 

April 20, 2020 at 11:00 a.m. GMT+1

SAINT-TROPEZ, France — ""The very rich,"" F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, ""are different from you and me."" Rarely has that statement been so glaringly clear, as the self-isolation strategies of the ultrawealthy are revealed by the coronavirus pandemic.

Some individuals are hiding out in state-of-the-art bunkers. Some have leased seaside mansions to hunker down for the duration. In the Grenadines, billionaire entertainment mogul David Geffen posted pictures on Instagram from his 454-foot megayacht, Rising Sun, replete with a tone-deaf “hoping everybody is staying safe” message.

And here in this Riviera resort — one of Geffen’s favorite summer ports of call — a gated compound of some of the world’s richest people has its very own, very private testing site.


Set in the director’s office of the 270-acre Les Parcs de Saint-Tropez — where LVMH luxury group chairman Bernard Arnault, Ritz Paris owner Mohamed al-Fayed and Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal have palatial villas — the medical unit is staffed with a doctor and lab technician to take and process samples from residents and their friends. Details were leaked to the regional newspaper, the Var-Matin, which reported that the effort was organized by Les Parcs’ association president, Jean-Louis Oger. The wealthy pharmacist-turned-entrepreneur owns several clinics and laboratories in the south of France.

Townspeople have widely condemned the clandestine center as yet another example of the inequality that spurred the gilets jaunes — or yellow vests — protest movement that has roiled the country since late 2018.

“So much for solidarity,” one local told the Var-Matin.

Across France, which already counts more than 19,700 deaths in the pandemic, most public hospitals are overwhelmed with covid-19 patients. Tests are in short supply or are completely inaccessible. Outside the compound’s walls, the situation is not much different at the Pôle de Santé du Golfe de Saint-Tropez hospital.


Medical personnel are “scandalized,” according to one hospital doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue on the peninsula. “It’s not normal that we have nothing — no tests — and that it is a nightmare for us to get a hold of one.”

Oger insists that the medical unit has only conducted blood tests for a clinical trial that his company is running to determine levels of immunity to the virus in people who have been infected.

“We have not done any nasal tests, which is how one determines if a patient is sick,” he said Friday. (Locals claim to have heard otherwise.) And if the trial proves successful, Oger promised to offer immunity testing to Tropeziennes once the government lifts its stay-home order.


What are the symptoms of covid-19 or coronavirus?

A half-hour drive from Les Parcs, a lab in Sainte-Maxime has coronavirus tests, and Oger said he has advised neighbors to go there if they fear they are infected. When told that the Saint-Tropez hospital had none, he responded: “That’s not my concern.”

The town isn’t buying his explanation. “I don’t believe it for a second,” scoffed Laetitia Leplaideur, a former president of the Rotary Club. “Tropeziennes are talking about the covid-19 testing, . . . and they are furious. We would all like to have a test.”

￼Coronavirus tests are in short supply or are inaccessible in medical facilities across France, including the Saint-Tropez hospital, located in the adjoining town of Gassin. (Sandra Mehl for The Washington Post)

Les Parcs de Saint-Tropez was founded in 1951, when builder Robert Geffroy, stuck in the picturesque fishing village after his yacht’s engine conked out, discovered a stretch of wild beachfront land just minutes away. By then, Saint-Tropez had already become a favorite holiday hideaway for the rich, famous and privileged.


Errol Flynn regularly sailed through on his ketch, Sirocco; Colette wrote books at her bungalow; and Coco Chanel and Jean Cocteau vacationed here. Geffroy spent the next 30 years developing the scrubby parcel on Pointe de l’Ay into a spectacularly exclusive neighborhood replete with a guard in a gatehouse — an early novelty.

Its most chronicled resident has long been billionaire Jacques Gaston “Tony” Murray, a World War II hero who later made a fortune in fire extinguishers. For years, Murray hosted the jet-set bash of the summer, attended by such glitterati as Ivana Trump, Naomi Campbell, Elton John and Prince Andrew. Entertainers such as Natalie Cole crooned poolside, and the tabloids provided breathless coverage. Alas, the fabulous fete is history. The centenarian’s age, not the coronavirus, is the reason.

Most owners of the 150-plus homes on the point are now more discreet, usually chauffeured to the manicured enclave in July and August by dark-windowed sedans or, even better, flown by helicopter. Many have private security details to supplement what the residence association provides. The mansions along the coast sport jetties to allow access to the superyachts anchored in the azure blue bay. There is a private beach club as well — though government decree closed it, like all beaches in France, on March 18, and the earliest reopening will not come until May 11.

Much of Saint-Tropez is shuttered because of the national lockdown; only essential businesses, such as grocery stores and bakeries, remain open. The narrow, stone-paved alleys that meander to the 15th-century port are empty, and the dusty Place des Lices, where old-timers play boules under the leafy canopy of gnarled plane trees, is quiet.


Les Parcs, however, is buzzing with activity. About a third of the residences are occupied, according to Oger. Gardeners and pool cleaners apparently are coming and going with ease, and construction projects are proceeding on schedule. Indeed, in disregard for safety concerns, some homeowners have told their property managers that if the maintenance personnel and contractors don’t show up, no one gets paid.

“This is an example of the Happy Few,” Leplaideur said. “As if they are saying, ‘Well, we have money, we do what we want, and we don’t care what the state says.’ The rules of confinement are well-respected across the peninsula, except in Les Parcs.”

It is unknown if the community has had any confirmed cases of covid-19. Since the testing site is on private property, it is outside the municipality’s jurisdiction. The Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur Regional Health Office in Marseille is “aware of the testing,” whatever sort it may be, spokeswoman Brigitte Lopresti noted last week with a whiff of exasperation. “There are norms to respect, and we gave them conditions one should follow. But it’s a private residence, and we don’t know what’s going on.”


C’est la vie, c’est la pandemic.

2020-04-20,ChunkyArsenio,Conservative,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/g564y8/bill_mcgurn_the_lockdown_rebellion/fo1hxco/,">  **Article:**

There they go again, ordinary Americans denying science and refusing to defer to their betters.

In state capitals across the country, citizens are protesting the continued coronavirus lockdowns. A CNN critic calls them “Covid-19 deniers,” notwithstanding that the science they allegedly deny still lacks conclusive answers to some of the most fundamental questions about the coronavirus.

In the past week, demonstrations have broken out in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia and Washington. In Pennsylvania the state legislature got into the act, sending Gov. Tom Wolf a bill that would order much of the state re-opened more quickly than he would like. More protests are planned for this week.

So who are these people? Some are folks who fear a permanent expansion of government and worry when they hear leaders such as New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy saying that constitutional considerations about lockdown measures are “above my pay grade.” Others are troubled by the First Amendment implications of politicians shutting down churches.

The do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do behavior of those imposing these rules isn’t boosting trust in authorities, either, whether it be Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot going out to get her hair done or New York Mayor Bill de Blasio being driven to his gym even as they were imploring everyone else to stay home. On Monday Mark Zuckerberg told George Stephanopoulos on ABC News that Facebook now classifies “a lot of the stuff” protesters are saying as “harmful misinformation”—and that Facebook will “take that down.”

Lost in all this is that the protesters are for the most part simply struggling Americans who have concluded that—at least for them—the cure is turning out to be worse than the disease.

“These protesters aren’t rich or privileged,” says Stephen Moore, a Trump economic adviser. “Most are folks living paycheck to paycheck or small-business owners seeing their livelihoods destroyed, and they are the ones who are bearing the crushing burden of the lockdown in their states.” Mr. Moore says he’s formed an organization, Save Our Country, to help them ensure their voices are heard.

Feeding the sense of grievance is not just the lockdowns but the way they have been imposed. Start with the overkill. This includes sheriff’s deputies arresting a paddle boater alone in the ocean off Malibu, Calif., city officials in San Clemente filling a popular skateboarding park with 37 tons of sand, and various states restricting big-box retailers from selling “nonessential items,” which means that you can get three scoops of chocolate chip from your local ice-cream shop but God forbid Home Depot sell you a bag of mulch.

Though it is common to portray the protesters as putting profits over public health, these are hardly wealthy investors worried about their portfolios. Unlike the roughly one-third of Americans who can work at home and still draw paychecks, for most Americans the lockdowns are more than an inconvenience. And the urgency of reopening looks very different for the 22 million American workers who have just lost their jobs—or the 1 in 4 small-business owners who, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say they are two months or less away from shutting down permanently.

Ditto for the charge that they are antiscience. Surely we could all use a little more modesty. Any honest appraisal would have to concede there is much that scientists have gotten wrong (the many models whose estimates of, say, deaths and ventilators needed proved wildly off), and much we still don’t know (the true lethality of Covid-19, the average number an infected person will infect, and so on).

Medical officials haven’t always been right, either. In January, Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who serves as a lead member of the president’s coronavirus task force, assured America that Covid-19 was “not something that the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about.”

This is no slam on Dr. Fauci. To the contrary, this is the way science works, as experts revise and adjust to new information. But it should be a warning not to regard these experts as oracles or science as a source of unequivocal answers beyond dispute. Scientists should have doubts and continue to put their hypotheses to the test.

The protests remain relatively small. But they do expose the elite disconnect with ordinary America. A recent New York magazine article captured the condescension and lack of empathy when it declared the protests are probably “going to spread nearly as rapidly as the coronavirus itself in the rich soil of anti-government subcultures where it’s widely accepted that ‘tyrants’ are exploiting the emergency to impose their godless socialist views on freedom-loving but fearful Americans.”

A better sense of this subculture might be the words chanted by Kentucky protesters outside their governor’s office last week. Their outrageous message? “We want to work.”"

January 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

February 2: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

February 28: “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa.” “They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it.

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

Edit: March 9: ""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant.”

March 10: ""It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.""

March 13: National Emergency Declaration

March 15: ""TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!""

March 16: ""I give myself a 10 out of 10""

March 22: “It is absolutely critical that Americans continue to follow the federal government’s guidelines. So important about social distancing, non-essential travel, and hand-washing.”

March 23: Democratic concerns have focused on a $500 billion funding program Republicans want to create for loans and loan guarantees, with some Democrats calling it a “slush fund” that lacks any oversight because the Treasury Department would have broad discretion over who receives the money. Asked about this Monday evening, Trump responded, “I’ll be the oversight.” The vote Monday was 49 to 46, well short of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the legislation for a final debate.

March 24: “THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!”

Scenario A
You're a 35 year old, in good health, but you found a tumor on your balls in the shower. The oncology offices arent seeing new patients and no one is taking non emergency surgeries. Well you're stuck with the tumor on your balls til further notice. Few months go by, its spread to the rest of your body. It could've gotten removed back in April or May and youd be cancer free but you couldn't get in due to lockdown. He dies later on from the cancer. 

Scenario B
You're a 40 year old, just divorced and your kids just left for college. You got by with your depression and anxiety always hanging with you by using medication and staying busy and living a good life. Suddenly everything is gone and you cant even see your doctor except over video call. Sure the medication is still there but your entire sustenance in life is gone. The depression and anxiety has reached astronomical levels and you are this close to putting a bullet through your head. Some of these people eventually will. 

There are MANY more similar type situations going on right now. I, and any rational human, isnt saying let's open things back up immediately and let whoever dies from the virus die. No, instead we're sympathizing with the millions being neglected and affected negatively by the societal reaction and peoples neglect. Also, have you bothered to look at the statistics at all? Curves are flattening around the world and have been. Overall cases in the US have been going. Take a look at any actual data backed graph and not just social media or news outlets.

>Newsom [outlined](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/politics/california-economy-coronavirus-newsom/index.html) a framework for reopening the economy in the Golden State on Tuesday that he said was predicated on the state's ability to do six things: expand testing to identify and isolate the infected, maintain vigilance to protect seniors and high risk individuals, be able to meet future surges in hospitals with a ""myriad of protective gear,"" continue to collaborate with academia on therapies and treatments, redraw regulations to ensure continued physical distancing at businesses and schools and develop new enforcement mechanisms to allow the state to pull back and reinstate stay-at-home orders.

> Keeping this level of social distancing going for an indefinite amount of time isn't just unsustainable, it's literally impossible. People want to get back to making money so they don't starve to death or kill themselves. People also don't want to die of coronavirus, but there's little to no guidance about how the US is going to go about doing that, which is absolutely necessary. 

While I understand your sentiment and agree with your point about how Reddit is comprised, in large part, by those who are less affected by the social distancing measures put in place by the government, the only thing that will stop this level of social distancing from becoming indefinite is by **flattening the curve**. And the only real way of doing that is through people maintaining their distance and staying home as much as possible. 

At the end of the day, money is money. While I recognize that not everybody is going to share the same viewpoint on money as me, I think it's fair to try and keep in mind how paradoxical your central argument is. The only way there is ""no endgame in sight,"" in regards to social distancing, is if people don't do their part. The longer everybody does their job and stays home, the less time it'll take for us to flatten the curve of newfound cases on a day-to-day basis. The less time we take to do that, the less time we'll be required to stay home, and the quicker we'll be able to start rolling out the economy again. 

The more successful we are at accomplishing all of that, the less stressed the healthcare system will be if (and when), another outbreak burst emerges, and the better able they'll be able to mitigate the situation. Thereby allowing for the economy to continue to roll out job reopenings and get things back to normal."

Edit. I noticed in your comments you keep stating that the flu kills more people than the coronavirus so what’s the big deal. Taking just your comments and what we know so far, the coronavirus has killed 40,000 in one month. Your stating the flu killed 80,000 over the entire flu season. Combine the flu with this new virus which we have zero immunity to and no vaccines and you are talking about having at least two flu seasons in one year. That’s extremely hard to deal with. Especially when we lack a leader who will face this issue head on and deal with it.

However, I’m afraid of getting coronavirus from customers coming to the store, so I quit and filed for unemployment. Can I obtain benefits under the CARES Act?

> No. Under the CARES Act, you may be eligible for benefits if you meet one of the circumstances listed in the Act, but none include the scenario described. On these facts, you are not eligible for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) because you do not meet any of the qualifying circumstances.

> There are, however, circumstances under the CARES Act in which specific, credible health concerns could require an individual to quit his or her job and thereby make the individual eligible for PUA. For example, an individual may be eligible for PUA if he or she was diagnosed with COVID-19 by a qualified medical professional, and although the individual no longer has COVID-19, the illness caused health complications that render the individual objectively unable to perform his or her essential job functions, with or without a reasonable accommodation. However, voluntarily deciding to quit your job out of a general concern about exposure to COVID-19 does not make you eligible for PUA. If you believe your employer’s response to the possible spread of COVID-19 creates a serious safety hazard or if you think your employer is not following OSHA standards, you can file a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

> As a general matter, you are likely to be eligible for PUA due to concerns about exposure to the coronavirus **only if you have been advised by a healthcare provider to self-quarantine as a result of such concerns. For instance, an individual whose immune system is compromised by virtue of a serious health condition, and who is therefore advised by a healthcare provider to self-quarantine in order to avoid the greater-than-average health risks that the individual might face if he or she were to become infected by the coronavirus will be eligible for PUA** if all other eligibility requirements are met.

Much complaining about wearing masks, curbside pickup, etc etc.  They live in a rural area of the state (of course) and are complaining that they're so restricted when ""there aren't even that many cases here!""  I pointed out that rural areas like where they live are actually pretty vulnerable even if there aren't many cases, because rural residents tend to be older and more obese than urban residents, and those are the two biggest risk factors for dying from COVID-19 (source here:  [https://www.healthline.com/health-news/rural-america-hardest-hit-by-covid-19-outbreak](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/rural-america-hardest-hit-by-covid-19-outbreak) ).  They flat-out refused to believe that rural residents tend to be older and fatter than urban residents....like, I'm sorry, but do you have eyes?
* FINALLY, and this is the thing that made me the most upset, I was like, jokingly, to my mother, Please don't be like those idiots going out and protesting against the stay at home orders without a mask and getting super close to other people, AND SHE SAID SHE WAS THINKING OF GOING TO A PROTEST TOMORROW at the state capital!! I told her (trying to stay calm) that i didn't think it was a good idea for her to go be in close proximity to other people without a mask, given she's over 60 and not in the best health, and she was like ""oh I'll just stay in my car and protest with a mask on"".  Does she not see the irony in protesting to open things back up while she herself is sitting in a car wearing a mask??? (she does not see the irony).
* Parents will not consider voting for Biden because ""he's senile"".  When asked for proof, they said he referred to the disease as ""COVID-9"" once.

i'm not sure this satisfies the issue, but i'm very much an amateur if someone wants to explain. is it still posisble that people who already were looking for reasons to ignore covid therefore may have chosen to watch hannity or stuck with him more, vs carlson's audience which may include individuals generally more skeptical of the republican party

Their education they so love to espouse has failed them.  Failed to teach skepticism and how to properly question and analyze a situation.  They don't want to hear any other side, diversity be damned, because they are right.  They've been told they are right their entire lives.  Their echo chambers continue to tell them they are right.  And, as much as they want to claim astroturfing is only occurring on the right, fail to see how they themselves are being astroturfed.  They have become the modern zealot.  Unquestioning faith in an ideology.  I believe there are some with ulterior motives, and there is certainly some incompetence, but I believe the underlying issues is zealotry fueled by social media.  That doesn't make them bad people anymore than atheists claim hyper religious people are bad.  It just means, in some ways, they are misguided.  At a minimum, their decision making is not rational, rather emotional or otherwise belief based.

As for lock downs, here's some hard data I've been researching.  This is a copy/paste from a thread yesterday.  

The current system is an all or nothing extreme approach.  The virus itself is not universal.  [We know the most impacted by demographic](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/).  We do not know the asymptomatic population numbers.  Further, we know the most impacted economically by the current lock down, young hourly workers and small businesses, are the least impacted by the virus.

According to [current statistics](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) there are 740928 cases in the US with a population of 330 million.  At the current rate of 30k new cases ([Log](https://imgur.com/7Uxmu6v), [linear](https://imgur.com/nYH6mw1)) a day, which has been sustained for 17 days with very little irregularity (new cases per day from 2-Apr to 18-Apr mean 30715.8, StDev 2565.3), we are looking at 11k days, or 30 years before we get through the virus.  The [number of days to double the amount of cases](https://imgur.com/T1Jc8pv) has been steadily increasing since mid-March.  Right now R0 is about 1 (assuming no asymptomatic people).  

What does that tell us?  The most impacted by the virus are also the most likely to weather an economic stop while the least impacted by the virus are also the least likely to weather an economic stop.  And that the rate of the spread has stalled.  Not that the spread has stopped, but the rate of increase has stalled.  (And before we move the goal posts to testing, [New York has one of the highest test rates in the world at 30,407 tests per 1M population](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) only rivaled by the U.A.E at scale and nearly 3 times the rate of South Korea).

Can there be a balance between those with low viral risk continue working while those with high risk, also typically retired or on fixed incomes, hunker down?  Can there be any amount of additional protection, such as distancing and masks, to help keep R0 down instead of a nearly universal lock down?"

“It has a very dangerous combination and this is happening in hundred years for the first time again, like the 1918 flu that killed up to 100 million people,” he told reporters in Geneva. “But now we have technology, we can prevent that disaster, we can prevent that kind of crisis.”

>The Lombardy outbreak came to light when a 38-year-old Italian tested positive in Codogno, a comune in the province of Lodi. On 14 February, he felt unwell and went to a doctor in Castiglione d'Adda. He was prescribed treatments for influenza.[34] On 16 February, as the man's condition worsened, he went to Codogno Hospital, reporting respiratory problems.[34] Initially there was no suspicion of COVID-19, so no additional precautionary measures were taken, and the virus was able to infect other patients and health workers.[35] On 19 February, the wife of the patient revealed he had met an Italian friend who had returned from China on 21 January, who subsequently tested negative.[34] Later, the patient, his pregnant wife and a friend tested positive.[34] On 20 February, three more cases were confirmed after the patients reported symptoms of pneumonia.[36] Thereafter, extensive screenings and checks were performed on everyone that had possibly been in contact with or near the infected subjects.[37] It has been subsequently reported that the origin of these cases has a possible connection to the first European local transmission that occurred in Munich, Germany, on 19 January 2020, consistent with phylogenetic analysis of viral genome.

It appears the virus found in the couple arrived from Wuhan slightly differs from those found in North. Could be nothing, could be a local mutation, too early to tell. But we shouldn't be probably reaching such conclusions. Kinda sounds racist tbh.

Our TraceTogether app is entirely voluntary (with govn't strongly recommending) and comes with no punishment for failure to dl and install. I can't speak for the data it collects, but let's be honest, sg govn't already have so much of our data even without using this app so it's really a non-issue for most ppl.

We punish people heavily for non-compliance and [passed the bill that enforces these punishments the very same day it was presented in parliament](https://www.clydeco.com/insight/article/covid-19-singapore-guide-to-temporary-measures-act-2020). For example, [we stripped a Chinese national of their Permanent Residency status and barred them from coming back into SG because they willfully disregarded govn't containment orders] (https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-singapore-permanent-resident-who-breached-stay-home-notice-stripped-of-pr) along with [charging a couple for lying to contact tracers with regards to their movement in SG](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/couple-who-had-coronavirus-charged-under-infectious-diseases-act-for-giving-false). I imagine these will be considered barbaric & unthinkable in the US."

2020-04-20,SakanaToDoubutsu,NoStupidQuestions,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/g4zytb/how_does_oil_have_a_negative_price/fo0hvui/,"Oil prices aren't negative, oil futures are negative.

A future is basically a way for a company to protect themselves from increased costs. For example, if the cost of a barrel of oil is $20, and companies expect that price to increase, a company like Holiday Gas Station might go to BP and say ""I'll pay you $20 for a barrel now, but I don't want you to give me the oil until 6 months from now"". If the price increases to say, $40 a barrel, Holiday Gas Station saves $20 on that barrel of oil. 


Now Holiday won't gamble all of their product on futures, so they're always buying oil on the open market. So a company like Goldman Sachs will come in and buy some of those $20 futures. If the price goes up to $40, then they can say to someone like Holiday and say, ""I bought these at $20, I'll sell them to you for $30"". Goldman Sachs makes a $10 profit and Holiday saves $10 when they buy that barrel of fuel from BP.

Basically what's happening now is that Coronavirus is restricting people's movement, so there's a huge surplus of crude oil, and companies like Goldman Sachs can't find people to buy the futures. Goldman Sachs obviously doesn't have the facilities to store fuel, and there are stiff penalties that Goldman Sachs would have to pay BP if they refused to take ownership of the crude oil, so it's cheaper for them to write it all off as a loss and give it away."

This is about May contracts only, they are now worthless. They expire tomorrow.

The reason that it's negative is that if you're left holding the contract in a glut with not enough storage, you have to take delivery of a barrel (or more) of oil.

Speculators are so common now they make up more of the market then the people who actually use the oil (refineries and warehousing).

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-19/oil-drops-to-18-year-low-on-global-demand-crunch-storage-woes

>The price on the futures contract for West Texas crude that is due to expire Tuesday fell into negative territory -- minus $37.63 a barrel. The reason: with the pandemic bringing the economy to a standstill, **there is so much unused oil sloshing around that American energy companies have run out of room to store it. And if there’s no place to put the oil, no one wants a crude contract that is about to come due.**

>Underscoring just how acute the concern is over the lack of immediate storage space, **the price on the futures contract due a month later settled at $20.43 per barrel. That gap between the two contracts is by far the biggest ever.**

>...


>Since the start of the year, oil prices have plunged after the compounding impacts of the coronavirus and a breakdown in the original OPEC+ agreement. **With no end in sight, and producers around the world continuing to pump, that’s causing a fire-sale among traders who don’t have access to storage.**"

We wanted to share some information with you regarding temporary changes to the Velocity program and what this means for you.
You may be aware that some of the Virgin Australia Group companies have entered Voluntary Administration. Deloitte has been appointed as the administrators, meaning they have assumed responsibility for the business and operations of those companies in administration.
The intention of the administrators is to bring the relevant Virgin Australia Group companies out of administration as quickly as possible and return to normal operations.
Although Velocity is owned by the Virgin Australia Group, it is a separate company and it is not in administration. That means we’re still operating, but we’ve made some temporary program changes in the interests of members.
We’ve made the difficult decision to pause all redemptions for an initial period of four weeks, effective immediately. This means you won’t be able to redeem your Points for rewards during the pause.
We know how much you love to plan your travel and use your Points to redeem flights, however the ongoing travel restrictions and reduced flights have limited the options for you to use Points for flights. We’re seeing more members use Points to shop online for items such as gift cards, electronic goods, and wine. This unexpected demand has made it difficult for our suppliers to provide these offers and limits the availability for all members to redeem their Points.
What you need to know:

Your Points aren’t going anywhere. They will remain in your account.

Your existing Points will not expire through this period. We will be extending the expiration period for your existing Points by the timeframe of the pause.

You can continue to earn Points with our partners, although you won’t be able to redeem them during the pause.

These changes take effect immediately. Although the initial timeframe for this restriction is four weeks, this period may be extended. We will come back to you with an update as soon as we can.

What’s next?
Velocity has a trustee in place to look after the interests of members. We will continue to assess a range of options for the program and we want that to include a continuation of our long-standing partnership with Virgin Australia.
We thank you for your patience, loyalty, and understanding in these challenging times.
The Velocity Frequent Flyer Team."

As far as I can tell this means that anyone near by someone will be able to collect their name and phone number.
Am I missing something here?
Even if the app keeps other people's data  inaccessible from users a modified version of the app would not be limited by that.
It can also be done without any modifications made to the app. There's apps that can tell you what requests your phone is making and what data those requests are sending so all someone would have to do is download one of them and make a fake claim of catching covid-19 through the contact tracing app and they would get all of the phone numbers and names of people they had been near.
This seems extremely problematic if this is the case.
The way Apple and google do this seems far more secure and does not give away any personal data to anyone near by or the government so why aren't the authorities implementing the same strategy.

In the late 90's Clinton went heavy on banking de-regulation before leaving office. After the repeal of Glass-Steagull Act, banks grew exponentially in size and had massive profits to throw around. 

Goldman Sachs was one of the first to apply for a government sanctioned exemption to trade shares in oil futures. Up until this point, natural resources that traded on the futures markets were priced almost exclusively on the real-world supply and demand. There was however, a very small group of ultra-wealthy investors that were allowed to buy and sell shares of crude oil. They were meant to act more like bonds, in order to act as a stabilizing force.

Unfortunately, after Goldman was granted an exemption to trade futures, other big banks followed suit. Eventually, these banks used their new found privileges to transform futures trading from a stabilizing entity into a speculative cash-cow.... which allowed them to manipulate oil prices, regardless of actual supply and demand, and wring out profits for themselves. 

Coronavirus is definitely having a negative impact on the market but this is undoubtedly a result of speculative manipulation, combined with an insane surplus of oil reserves that were made possible by massive de-regulation and unnecessary pipelines and fracking ops being green-lit by our government.

So I think I can offer one perspective. 

On one hand I think the monarchy are just something quintessentially British/UKish. When people think of the U.K. they think of things like Red phone boxes, London buses, British bulldogs, football, Big Ben, Westminster and so on and the monarchy are part of that. They’re just something we’ve pretty much always had and I think a lot of people don’t see the issue with paying a bit extra in tax to have them.

In terms of what they actually do it’s nice to have an ambassador with actual longevity to represent the nation. Prime ministers have come and gone but the queen commands respect worldwide no matter what. They do a good bit of charity work, they’re supposedly good for tourism and so on. I’m not sure if the benefits outweigh the cost but that’s what they actually do. They are figureheads. They’re also supposed to be smart well educated figures of authority that people can put faith in. For a lot of people what the queen says has real weight. Her speech on coronavirus put a lot of old people’s fears to rest for example. People generally trust them, which is why the Andrew scandal was such a blow. 

In other ways it’s just the fascination thing. Why are the Kardashians so popular? It’s like that except even more exclusives Cos the royals don’t put themselves in the spotlight quite the same way. Human interest stories really is a lot of the obsession. People also enjoy the pageantry of things like royal weddings, coronations, trouping of the colour, the queens birthday and other such occasions.

I mean I’m not the biggest fan of them. I’m quite indifferent. But that’s what I can gather it is."

Overall, the city (and state) are doing a phenomenal job at adhering to social distancing.  It's incredibly good to see compared to my home in Florida which continues to be a hot mess.

The most troubling part of this all is that those who are affected by COVID-19 are those who are unable to socially distance.  It affects everyone, but [disproportionately affects the underserved and minorities](https://twitter.com/ckelly60637/status/1250803701989740545).

Social distancing is a privilege that not everyone can afford.

It's been an annual tradition since 1897, and today is the first day it's canceled, [concurrent with us hitting our anticipated COVID peak](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/massachusetts).

It's real when my half-white friend's Muslim mom gets stopped for secondary assessment for every flight she's been on, because her name screams terrorist to most airport security staff. My friend passes through each time with her dad's French last name and light brown hair. Btw her mom is a scientist who flies frequently for conferences. She's been stopped every time.

It's real when the black percentage of the population in Michigan and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, is nearly three times smaller than the black percentage of their coronavirus death tolls (as of April 7th) due to decreased access to healthcare, and the greater proportion of black communities living in food deserts than other ethnicities in the US (maybe except for Native Americans), among other reasons.

I know plenty of white people are very disadvantaged for other reasons, but being a part of the ethnic majority in your country makes you that much less likely to encounter discrimination and barriers to success. It is a privilege to live without those barriers.

First, of course doctors and nurses are going to work. Right now their services are needed most. It's truly a slap in the face to those front line workers to continue life as normal during this time, and risk spreading the virus, thus putting them in greater risk. What's more is the egotism you show comparing you dildo packing day job to that of a doctor, nurse or police officer in these times. I do the same job you do so I know for a fact our jobs packing god knows what bullshit all day is not truly ""essential"" and honestly the fact that you have such an egotistical attitude towards your menial job shows how pathetic your life must be.

Second, I currently live with my father who is 70, and my brother who has athsma. If not working because I don't want to spread a disease that would surely kill them makes me a coward, then fine, I take no shame in that. And yes, I know a thing or two about pride. I was incredibly disheartened when my FC got its first confirmed case and I could no longer work. I love my job, I work my dick off every single day. I'm a consistent top performer in my department and I'm certain my rates are better than yours. In fact, I was chosen for ambassadorship by multiple managers in my department. I didn't ask to be made one. They each independently decided I met the standards for that role and gave my name to the learning team. Additionally, I was being scheduled as a process guide with the understanding from my manager that I was to become a process assistant when a spot became available. Believe me, I wish I could be working right now, but its not an option given that there is a very real, very dangerous epidemic going on currently and it doesn't care how ""brave"" you are for showing up.

Last, I don't even collect unemployment, nor have I ever. I am fortunate enough to not need to, but I am an emotionally mature human being capable of this thing called empathy, so I don't look down upon those in worse circumstances than myself. I am glad the safety net exists for those who need it, and am happy that my hard earned tax dollars are going towards helping someone in need.

I really encourage you to read up on the Coronavirus, and how it is killing people by the thousands [and is still getting worse](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2020/04/02/coronavirus-death-rate-is-increasing-in-the-usthese-are-the-worst-hit-states/#38bc872c6a67), and also things like the fight for labor rights in this country and [systemic inequality](https://www.thebalance.com/structural-inequality-facts-types-causes-solution-4174727) that necessitate such safety nets. I really think you ought to try considering yourself fortunate for being in a position where you are still able to work, rather than passing judgement upon others in less ideal circumstances."

Plus, the thing about Michigan is that--like most states and most countries--they don't do that 'old fashioned' thing of locking up entire infected households and leaving them all to die inside. When more people get sick, the government has to use whatever available staff and resources to prevent these people from getting critical. Which means we wind up losing more resources (and potentially, we wind up with sicker medical staff) which puts the state into increasing the lockdown period.   

People may be out and about in your town (just like in my old home town in Spain! When Spain first went to lockdown, hundreds of people flocked to beaches as if it was a big federal holiday), but two things are going to happen: either the virus never develops into a full-on outbreak in Michigan--or it's going to wind up like Spain where the entire infrastructure gets overwhelmed (with local doctors, nurses, policemen, teachers and military personel also getting sick, and being physically unable to carry out their jobs). 

Hopefully it blows over for you guys. But having increased infections like this is going to cost the state a lot of money (and people, and its medical resources that also cost money)."

Risk Watch: Why the Chinese Regime is Gearing Up for a Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis

April 20, 2020

◎ The PRC’s recent belligerence foreshadows a fourth confrontation in the Taiwan Strait. 
Even as the People’s Republic of China continues its “people’s war” against the novel coronavirus pandemic, the communist regime’s behavior in recent weeks suggests that Beijing is spoiling for a fight with Taiwan. 
Since late January, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army has stepped up military activity near the Republic of China—as Taiwan is formally known—sending combat aircraft and warships on provocative assignments above and in waters around the island. 
Meanwhile, mainland regime officials and state media have made increasingly bellicose statements criticizing the ROC, which the Chinese Communist Party regards as a rightful part of the PRC. 
The CCP and Chinese leader Xi Jinping face mounting pressure amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which paralyzed China’s already-suffering economy and is accelerating the exodus of foreign firms. The international community, including the U.S. government and major media outlets, are voicing increasing skepticism of the PRC’s claims that it has brought the epidemic under control, while hounding Beijing for answers regarding the still-unclear origins of the virus.
Taiwan, a democratic state, has earned praise for its effective handling of the epidemic, with just several hundred confirmed cases at the time of writing. This has contrasted it with the authoritarian PRC, where the CCP’s weeks-long cover-up led to a major outbreak in Wuhan—the virus epicenter—that spread to the rest of the country and around the world. 
For the CCP regime, the contrasting example set by Taiwan—the “other” China—only exacerbates the tensions felt in Beijing. It also threatens to torpedo the Party’s narrative on epidemic control efforts, described by ROC foreign minister Joseph Wu as being “that only authoritarian regimes have the resources and capabilities to deal with the problem.” 
Following the three Taiwan Strait crises in the 20th century that saw the PRC and the ROC come to the brink of war, the mainland’s recent belligerence foreshadows a fourth confrontation. 
While a “Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis” is unlikely to involve an actual invasion of the ROC—the PLA does not appear to be capable of the amphibious operations such an undertaking would require—the CCP may decide that it needs a distraction from the domestic troubles stirred up by the pandemic. 
Provocations
Speaking at the Hudson Institute in Washington on April 9, Joseph Wu made remarks comparing Taiwan’s pandemic response to the mainland’s “Chinese communist” model. 
The next day, CCP-run tabloid Global Times ran an opinion piece cautioning Taipei for Wu’s “antagonistic” statements, warning the ROC against using the pandemic to worsen Sino-U.S. relations. The article concluded with an ominous threat rendered in classical Chinese: “Don’t say you haven’t been forewarned” (勿謂言之不預).
Also on April 10, the PLA Air Force dispatched a flight of six aircraft, including a nuclear-capable H-6 bomber and J-11 fighters, on a long-range training mission that brought the planes close to Taiwan’s southern coast.
On April 11 and April 12, PLA Navy aircraft carrier Liaoning and several accompanying warships sailed through the Miyako Strait northeast of Taiwan, then carried out exercises off the island’s eastern coast before heading toward the South China Sea. The PLA has conducted similar exercises, such as aerial circumnavigations of Taiwan via the Bashi and Miyako straits on Feb. 9 and Feb. 10, with increased frequency. 
In mid-March, more than 10 Chinese speedboats harassed an ROC coast guard vessel in the Taiwan strait. The mainland crews hurled rocks and bottles at the Taiwanese ship; one speedboat even rammed it from the rear. 
On March 11, days prior to the speedboat incident, former PLA Navy rear admiral and Party princeling Luo Yuan told Global Times that senior Taiwan officials, including President Tsai Ing-wen, had seized the epidemic period to “profit from China’s misfortunes” and even “oppose China and plan for independence.” Luo further remarked that a timeline for reunifying Taiwan with the mainland should be announced “in a timely manner,” rather than letting the issue “drag on without resolution.” 
A week later, American Institute in Taiwan Director Brent Christensen and Taiwanese foreign minister Joseph Wu signed a U.S.-Taiwan Joint Statement “to further strengthen U.S.-Taiwan consultation and cooperation on combating the COVID-19 virus.” The PRC foreign ministry accused Taiwan’s incumbent Democratic Progressive Party of using the Joint Statement to “take advantage of the epidemic to push for Taiwan independence.”
On March 26, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act into law, requiring the United States to “alter” engagement with countries that undermine Taiwan’s security or prosperity. PRC foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the TAIPEI Act was “flagrant hegemonism” and would be met with “resolute countermeasures.” 
On April 15, a website of the PRC Taiwan affairs council ran an article that includes “authoritative analysis” by a PLA expert on conditions needed for “military unification” of the island with mainland China. The same day, a WeChat account belonging to the PLA Eastern Theater Command Ground Forces called “People’s Front” shared an article called “Enough Illusions, Prepare for War.” 
Why the CCP Needs a Crisis
Beijing’s provocations against Taiwan can be explained by the mounting challenges the Communist Party faces at home. 
The PRC is beset with serious economic and social malaise, which the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic has only worsened. With economic growth all but halted and a second wave of virus infections on the horizon, the Chinese authorities face renewed public health disaster while millions of ordinary citizens struggle to keep their jobs. Meanwhile, shocks to global trade threaten China’s food security. 
And for Xi Jinping, the coronavirus epidemic has deepened factional disagreements within the CCP. Since the beginning of the crisis, Party elites at odds with Xi have used a variety of channels to voice roundabout attacks on the Chinese leader, even comparing him to the doomed Chongzhen emperor of the late Ming Dynasty. 
In previous analysis, we clarified Xi’s need to bring the Party to “consensus” in the face of external crises. As the CCP’s propaganda narratives about having brought the virus under control stand to be checked by reality, Xi and the Party require some means of distracting both domestic and foreign audiences. 
Further, by escalating tensions with Taiwan, Xi may hope to create an external crisis that can be used as a tool to create intra-Party unity. This unity would shield Xi from attacks by his political rivals, which if not prevented could endanger the regime. 
In response to the PLA’s recent activity vis-a-vis Taiwan, the U.S. military has responded by dispatching reconnaissance and combat aircraft to patrol the Taiwan Strait. However, given that the CCP’s motivation for starting a Fourth Taiwan Crisis would be in reaction to domestic unrest and the unravelling of its global propaganda offensive, such moves are unlikely to convince Beijing to back down from a confrontation. 
Another reason for Beijing to mount an offensive against Taiwan is ideological. Being a culturally and ethnically Chinese society with a fully functional democracy, the ROC stands as an inherent challenge to the CCP’s legitimacy. This challenge is particularly highlighted by the differing responses to the pandemic on either side of the Strait.  
In his speech made at the Hudson Institute, Taiwan foreign minister Joseph Wu stressed the importance of transparency and honesty in fighting the Wuhan coronavirus. 
“We in Taiwan cannot afford to conceal or lie, but the Chinese communists are institutionally incapable of telling the truth,” Wu said. He also criticized the CCP’s glowing depiction of its “people’s war” on the virus as being “the most dangerous narrative to arise from the pandemic.”
“Taiwan is a counterweight to this narrative,” Wu said."
