I didn‚Äôt buy anything I wouldn‚Äôt use eventually. I gave my parents masks, then sent them to Costco with my credit card and told them to do the same.  I have never done anything like this, I‚Äôm not a prepper who‚Äôs been eagerly waiting for the end of the world.  I just decided that it was going to get here and get bad at some point.


My wife scoffed at me.  I told her there will come a time when we‚Äôll want the option to just stay home for a month or two, and if we absolutely have to go out to be prepared to do so safely.  She‚Äôs not scoffing now.  


It‚Äôs not panic buying if you have a plan and calmly execute it in a timely manner.  Panic buying is what people do who didn‚Äôt have the foresight to prepare.

**EDIT** I‚Äôm really getting sick of hearing this ‚Äúdon‚Äôt buy masks the healthcare workers need‚Äù bullshit in the media.  Like surgeons and nurses are buying them from Lowe‚Äôs down the street or Amazon and can‚Äôt get them now because I chose to protect my family a month ago.  Fuck you BBC.

>Although the writer of the tweet didn‚Äôt respond to our request for comment, it appears that the claim is based on a news story that detailed the experience of one man in Miami. The story, which first appeared in the Miami Herald, has spread widely as other news outlets have picked it up and, in some cases, used it to illustrate problems with the U.S. health care system.

>According to the Herald, Osmel Martinez Azcue had been to China for work and returned to Miami in January with ‚Äúflu-like symptoms.‚Äù He went to Jackson Memorial Hospital since he worried that he may have contracted the new coronavirus disease, now called COVID-19. The initial cost for his visit was $3,270, billed to his insurance company.

>That total included an emergency room visit and testing for 22 upper respiratory pathogens, according to Lidia Amoretti, a spokeswoman for the hospital who answered questions from FactCheck.org by email. Azcue tested positive for the flu and, after hospital workers consulted with the Florida Department of Health, he was not tested for COVID-19.

S-cov is likely the more ancient of the two, with L-cov evolved from S-cov. This is due to S-cov having greater similarity to bat coronavirus that is like to be their common ancestor.

L-cov have superior transmissibility and higher virulence than S-cov. In the initial outbreak in Wuhan the majority of the population was L-cov. However due to enormous selective pressure applied to to the virus via quarantine S-cov is making a comeback relative to its sibling.

Out of the 103 samples in the study all but one was infected with either S-cov or L-cov. The one outlier was an American with wuhan travel history who had both S-cov and L-cov in him."

This comes from an article about multiple strains. The more aggressive strain is currently the most prominent but originated from a less aggressive strain which happened near or before the first infections. The less aggressive strain isnt thought to have ever been the most prominent in infections. The virus hasn't evolved to be more aggressive than what we see in Wuhan since the most infections are coming from the aggressive strain to begin with. IN FACT, researchers actually think the more aggressive strain may be lowering because this is the one that is more largely supressed by the quarantine (since it has more aggressive symptoms so people notice and stay home) and there may be slightly more less-aggressive strains in circulation compared to the original ratio in Wuhan, which is actually good news. But thats just speculation. The more aggressive strain has always been what we're dealing with and this virus has not further mutated (well of course its mutated, but not to be more or less virulent) since we learned about it in Dec"

Some of what is being looked at has to do with smoking. Not just being an active smoker, but being in areas with significant amounts of second-hand smoke as well. The fact is up until the 90s, secondhand smoke was everywhere and smoking was very common. there is some thought that second-hand smoke and not to mention primary smoke activates certain markers in the lungs that this virus uses to bind and replicate. A significant portion of the population has these immune markers based on their exposure to smoke for years if not decades. 

Infants and pediatric cases obviously would be less exposed to smoke, and younger generations have been exposed to less in totality."

Yesterday in a press briefing, Dr. Nancy Messonnier at the CDC said that the secondary attack rate among family members of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is 10.5% so far. So that means that about 1 in 10 family members who have been exposed by a relative have gotten sick.  

If you or a loved one gets sick, the advice I‚Äôve seen from public health officials is to try to put a mask on them (that may be hard, given the scarcity of masks in the U.S. right now), and isolate them from others.  The recommendation is to try to have them use their own bedroom and bathroom separately from the rest of the family. Of course, wash your hands and disinfect common contact surfaces frequently. - Brenda Goodman"

>SEATTLE ‚Äî The first public indication that something was wrong inside the Life Care nursing care center in Kirkland, Wash., came on Friday, prompting an alarming sign to go up on the front door: ‚ÄúWE ARE HAVING RESPIRATORY OUTBREAK.‚Äù

>Since then, officials have announced a series of coronavirus cases, some of them fatal, from the facility, which has become an ominous symbol of the dangers the virus poses.

>On Tuesday, the authorities made another jarring announcement: The first virus-related deaths tied to the nursing center occurred days earlier than previously known ‚Äî and well before residents had been quarantined in their rooms.

>A man in his 50s, who was rushed from the facility in a Seattle suburb to a hospital on Feb. 24, died last Wednesday. On the same day, another patient from the center, a woman in her 80s, died at her family home. Both of their deaths have now been attributed to the coronavirus.

>The ire of the relatives of those inside was growing with each new revelation.

>‚ÄúBecause these are elderly and infirm people, it‚Äôs like we are waiting for them to be picked off, one by one,‚Äù said Kevin Connolly, whose 81-year-old father-in-law, Jerry Wall, has been at Life Care for about a year, recovering from heart and kidney failure.

>Mr. Connolly said about 65 families with relatives in the facility have been in touch after Life Care emailed the families a generic update yesterday but left their email addresses visible. ‚ÄúEverybody on that thread started sharing their stories,‚Äù said Jodi Connolly, who said that her father‚Äôs regular nurse was not working and that he had not been told why.

>‚ÄúThey are prisoners with no information in there,‚Äù she said.
The news that two people from the center died of coronavirus days before officials identified the emerging crisis suggested that the virus had been circulating inside the facility even longer than had been understood. That means it may have been a threat to visitors, workers and residents for days, widening the circle of people who may be at risk.

>Nowhere else in the country has been known to have been hit as hard by the virus as Kirkland.

>Seven residents of the Life Care center were dead from the virus, and seven other people with connections to the home had been sickened by it. One visitor to the center apparently traveled home to North Carolina before testing positive for the virus, an outcome North Carolina officials announced on Tuesday.

>Dr. Chris Spitters, the health officer in Snohomish County, north of Seattle, said resources have become stretched in a way that limits how much officials can focus on any one case
‚ÄúReally, we‚Äôre kind of having to triage our efforts,‚Äù he said.

>Across Washington State, nine people have died, the only deaths in the United States in a coronavirus crisis that has killed 3,000 people worldwide. State officials also announced that several more people have been sickened, including two people in their 20s who were hospitalized in the Seattle suburb of Issaquah. On Tuesday, Amazon told employees via email that a worker in one of its many office buildings in Seattle‚Äôs South Lake Union neighborhood had tested positive for the virus.

>Dr. Manisha Juthani, an associate professor at Yale School of Medicine who studies infectious diseases in older populations, said it was sad but not unexpected that the virus had reached a nursing facility and, once there, caused multiple deaths.

>‚ÄúAre we going to see this again in other facilities?‚Äù Dr. Juthani said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we do.‚Äù

>In Kirkland, a quarter of the city‚Äôs firefighters and a few police officers have been asked to isolate themselves after they visited the nursing center. A dozen of them had flulike symptoms, an official said.
Families of the nursing facility residents were growing increasingly anxious as residents continued to be kept inside the center, and visits were not allowed.

>‚ÄúI went from not worrying much to being really worried now,‚Äù said Debbie Delosangeles, who said in an interview with The New York Times on Monday that she had been told that her 85-year-old mother had been symptom free. On Tuesday, she learned that her mother‚Äôs health had declined. Workers told Ms. Delosangeles that they would treat her mother for her high fever but did not intend to test her for coronavirus unless she developed breathing problems.

>Bridget Parkhill said her 77-year-old mother had been sick inside the facility for nearly a week, and had a breathing issue for a short while, but had not been tested.

>‚ÄúMom found out today that a friend that would come see her all the time was in the hospital and not doing well,‚Äù Ms. Parkhill said. She said she had visited the facility and walked around the exterior, to see her mother through a window.

>Officials at the Life Care center have said that they were following federal protocol and were doing the best they could given a chaotic situation. At Harborview Medical Center, where one person has died, officials were working to determine which staff members may have been exposed to the virus.

.Officials in Washington State were rushing to take steps to contain the spread. Health officials were asking the State Legislature for an additional $100 million in funding to help respond to the virus. Some leaders were weighing widespread closings of events.

>Businesses, schools and houses of worship altered their practices. Amazon and Microsoft have turned events related to International Women‚Äôs Day later this week into online meetings. The Archdiocese of Seattle indefinitely postponed an annual Mass and dance for people with disabilities that had been set for Saturday. And a baseball league for youths told parents that players would be discouraged from giving high-fives and handshakes.

>Officials from the Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday that they were closing a Seattle field office of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services after an employee visited the Kirkland nursing care facility and developed symptoms of illness. The employee had been going to work after the visit but before getting sick.

>Dr. Spitters, the health officer in Snohomish County, said officials may get to a point where they need to limit public gatherings, such as high school basketball games and conventions.

>‚ÄúThese things could end up becoming temporarily discouraged, if not prohibited,‚Äù Dr. Spitters said."

Many will not require hospitalization, and in fact, many don‚Äôt even consider this infection or seek medical care - possibly contributing to community transmission in some settings. The symptoms tend to be fever and cough, but some will have more severe manifestations than others. Remember that all ‚Äúpneumonia‚Äù means is an infection in the lung...it does not tell you how severe a particular case is. Fortunately most seem to do well with this infection and recover quickly.

2020-03-04,agehaw,Coronavirus,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fcr8dy/daily_discussion_post_march_3_2020_questions/fjft3ph/,"I‚Äôm kind of annoyed how ppl in the US are so relaxed about the coronavirus after seeing country after country falling to its victim, citing a .2% CFR for younger age brackets and dismissing it as something ‚Äújust like the flu.‚Äù Yes, the likelihood of you dying from it is probably lower than the chance of getting into a car accident in certain cities, but here are a few things I want to note:

1. COVID-19 has a moderately high rate to cause severe syndrome (studies vary but the reports I‚Äôve seen seems to think the rate is somewhere between 17-20%) - i.e one out of 5 or 6 patients will need hospitalization. These are highly infectious patients who will need specialized hospital rooms, constant oxygen supply, protective gear for the doctors/nurses/medics and an estimate of half of them may need ICU care (ventilators even ECMOs and who know what else). This may not seem a problem when a hundred ppl are infected in an area, but if thousands or tens of thousands are infected, imagine the pressure it has on local hospitals. This was what happened in Wuhan in January - too many patients and not nearly enough hospital beds nor doctors/nurses. Ppl with severe syndrome progress to life threatening condition due to lack of care and many of of them died before being admitted into ICU or even a regular hospital room.  Hence the much higher fatality rate in Wuhan compared to other places. I agree we have much more and better hospital resources here but by how much I have no idea. Do we really want to run a stress test on this by allowing the virus to transmit freely?

2. It‚Äôs true that a .2% mortality shouldn‚Äôt concern most health young ppl but please be mindful of the elderly and weak folks around you. Given the long incubation period of this virus, many ppl may be infectious and spreading the virus to their loved ones, coworkers and other random ppl without knowing, for days. So to exercise precaution now really isn‚Äôt about being paranoid about a remote chance of death, it‚Äôs also accepting the social responsibility that one wishes not to become a spreader of a virus that can be quite deadly for others. 

3. I understand the need to keep the public from panicking and not halt the economy completely like what China did but why can‚Äôt the government be honest with this? Let‚Äôs just acknowledge that this is a difficult balance to strike - shutting down too early the economy will take more hit, chance it for too long the damage this virus causes may overtake the initial economic savings. This is a policy decision not a scientific one. The result will make a difference for politicians afterwards as reflected by a bunch of numbers. But for a lot of regular folks, this decision may mean everything to them - some will lose their jobs and others may never see the next spring. Don‚Äôt they deserve to know the facts and at least be educated on the risks involved? Why isn‚Äôt the US testing it‚Äôs public as do the other countries? At what threshold should the local authorities cancel schools and large gatherings as a precaution? It‚Äôs not ok to keep being told everything will be ok without any factual support."

2020-03-04,webmd,Coronavirus,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fdf5fq/we_are_a_team_of_medical_experts_following/fjh52fw/,"We are learning more and more about the full spectrum of illness rapidly. 

Some people are truly asymptomatic - they test positive and are infected with the virus, but really have no symptoms at all. There are a few examples of this. I like this one, where 2 out of 114 people who returned from Germany from Wuhan were found to have the infection, but they did not have symptoms: [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001899](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001899)

Of course, we also know that some have very severe symptoms, require Intensive Care Unit-care and sadly succumb to their illness. Then there is a large spectrum of illness in between. The interesting thing is that as we see diagnostic testing rolled out (e.g. South Korea), there is a growing appreciation that mild symptoms are actually rather common. Currently the estimates are that about 80-ish% of people will have a milder course of illness, but I think as we learn more about the infection this proportion may grow a bit. 

What does a mild infection look like? Perhaps a low-grade fever and a mild cough for a few days. Currently, in many countries, people with mild symptoms are still being diagnosed in a hospital setting and then getting sent home as there is no reason to keep them in hospital...they clinically well enough to recover at home. Some regions (e.g. UK, South Korea) are scaling up diagnostic testing outside of hospitals to 1) provide great care in an out-patient setting, 2) prevent overcrowding of their Emergency Departments.

Door handles, escalator handrails, self-service checkouts; objects we touch every day without much thought that could become key to containing the spread of the coronavirus.

It tends to survive best on hard metal and plastic surfaces, and COVID-19 is thought to behave similarly.

That could mean things like escalator handrails, self-service checkouts, door handles, touch screens at fast food restaurants and cinemas, and vending machines.

How long could Coronavirus survive on such objets?
""It can depend on the nature of the surface, the temperature, the humidity. It could be hours, certainly enough time for people to touch it and potentially become infected.

Dr Killingley said it could be a ""lottery"" as to how people become infected with COVID-19, but that your chances of getting infected from an object could be limited by your own personal hygiene.

""The chance of touching one thing and getting infected is pretty low,"" he told Sky News.

""It would be pretty unlucky, (but) it's a bit of a lottery. It's really the cumulative risk of touching lots of things, and then it comes down to how much you touch your face.

One thing you should not rely on to protect you is a mask.

""You can understand why people are doing it - every picture you see you see people are wearing face masks - but masks don't protect you from infection,"" said Dr Killingley.

""They are useful for healthcare workers because we change them regularly. We wouldn't wear a mask for any longer than 30 minutes."

The mortality rate of COVID-19 is unclear, most estimates range from 1-3%, so let‚Äôs take 1%.

In a recent NEJM article looking at 1,099 patients in China, 25 were intubated and 15 died; based on this, the intubation rate for COVID would be 1.7%.

So 360,000,000 \* 20% \* 1.7% = 1,224,000. Let‚Äôs say the length of intubation is 10 days, and that the requirement of ventilators evenly distribute throughout the next 100 days, then 122,400 ventilator per day is required.

Total number of ventilators in the US hospitals is estimately 62,188, which met half of the requirement of COVID-19.

And you need to consider these 62,188 ventilators need to serve other diseases, and that the distribution is not evenly distributed (aka there will be peaks), and that the mean length of intubation may be longer than 10 days, etc. So beyond the fact that COVID-19 is 20 times more deadly than seasonal influenza, it exhausts medical resources. When medical resource burns out, the mortality rate will probably go higher, like what happened in the city of Wuhan‚Ä¶

So as far as I can see, any politicians who say COVID-19 is comparable to flu should go get their brain checked, and we definitely need a more stringent strategy to contain this potential pandemic..."

2020-03-04,Whateverbeast,Coronavirus,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fdony7/chinese_scientist_reveals_plans_to_cure_covid19/fjivsl6/," The TL:DR is that a panel of China's top scientist just published their treatment protocol for Coronavirus and it includes intravenous vitamin c at 50 to 200 mg per kg patient body weight per day. This is HUGE news as there have been proponents of IVC (intravenous c) to fight acute viral infection for decades, with a mountain of evidence supporting it, but the pharmaceutical industry has refused to acknowledge it despite peer reviewed papers confirming the results.

&#x200B;

Here is a second example of a hospital in Wuhan coming to the same conclusion:

[http://2yuan.xjtu.edu.cn/Html/News/Articles/21774.html](http://2yuan.xjtu.edu.cn/Html/News/Articles/21774.html)

&#x200B;

Here is Dr. Richard Cheng (PhD, MD) in China now as an Epidemic Medical Support Team Leader confirming that there are already three official clinical trials of high-dose vitamin c underway in China alone: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMDX0RSDp1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMDX0RSDp1k)

Here is just one of them: [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533)

&#x200B;

Here is Dr. Cheng again, this time relaying a recent anecdote of a high-risk woman who survived after going on ECMO with IVC: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-elCYFhqJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-elCYFhqJs) 

&#x200B;

The same thing is happening in Korea. Hospitals all over China and Korea are beginning to admit that high-dose vitamin c is a highly effective therapy (for those who have been willing to test it). The West refuses to report on this, there is a media blackout on it, because there is so much money at stake. Trump just held a conference in the White House with pharma companies on developing a vaccine, they refuse to report on these developments because there are trillions in revenue from both acute and chronic disease that could be ameliorated with IVC (not only this one pandemic): here is the round table [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mzSlaA2Td0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mzSlaA2Td0) 

 Why vitamin c?

99.9% of the animal kingdom biosynthesizes its own vitamin c. All the top doctors who have investigated this subject believe that the optimal human dose of vitamin c for your average adult is around three to five grams per day. You cannot possibly get this from a diet of fruits or any other food. This optimal number is extrapolated based on what other animals biosynthesize (or ingest in the case of the rare animals that cannot biosynthesize, such as fruit bats) in terms of milligrams ascorbate per kilogram body weight. The funny thing is that across the entire spectrum of the animal kingdom, all animals seem to follow nearly the same dose of milligrams ascorbate per kilogram body weight, universally. Mind you this is for a healthy animals, not one that is sick. Linus Pauling recommended about 3 g per day for a healthy human adult, in powdered form, dissolved in citrus juice such as orange juice, spread throughout the day (for example 1 gram in the morning, 1 gram in the afternoon, 1 gram in the evening evening). It's true that some of it will come out in your urine, Dr Pauling tested this. He found that, of the three grams that he took, a relatively minor percentage came out in urine. Given how cheap powdered vitamin c is, this is not a concern, and accordingly actively protected his urinary tract since vitamin c by its nature reduces oxidative stress. He lived to be 93 following his own advice (which included taking Lysine for cardiovascular support).

&#x200B;

If you become acutely ill from a viral infection such as swine flu or coronavirus, and you were hospitalized, you would want intravenous vitamin c in the range of about half a gram per kilogram body weight per day. The numbers for a healthy human, and one under extreme stress or finding a disease are vastly different. The same is true in the animal kingdom. A healthy dog does not biosynthesize nearly as much vitamin c as one that is fighting an illness, by orders of magnitude. 

 Liposomal vitamin c can be used to elevate serum levels when intravenous is not available. LivOn labs makes the only form I am aware of that is composed of true liposomes. It's expensive but worth it in a life/death situation (only the elderly/infirm would likely need this, so you could have some on hand for your parents for example). It works by depositing the vitamin c directly into cells (normally vitamin c competes with glucose for cell uptake, and takes energy to pump into the cells, it also has a relatively low absorption compared to liposomal).
