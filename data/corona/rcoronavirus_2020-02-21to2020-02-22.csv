Your link to the politico article only points to the problems with active testing, as if that's the only way public health experts track disease.  
  
Our ""bad"" flu season is actually not even that bad -- while I can't deny there's a lot of sicknesses going around, I invite you to explore the CDC influenza surveillance report (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm). Review the numbers yourself and you'll see that hospitalizations and pneumonia deaths are down. Look at the trend from 2017-2018 and you'll see a HUGE spike in deaths that pointed to the most severe flu season since swine flu outbreak back in 2009."

And if you think about it for a moment, they probably SHOULD play down coverage.

Realistically, what exactly is Joe Schmoe, our average guy (or gal), going to do with minute by minute coverage of this health crisis, except panic and take actions likely directly contradictory to the best interests of reduction of the virus on a mass scale?

Joe will “prep” and buy medical supplies he doesn’t really know how to use, and put the, in place when he may not even need them for quite some time, depending on his location. We have already seen how this removes those supplies out of the stock needed for trained medical professionals, actual victims of the disease, and those who are most vulnerable (pre existing lung conditions), thereby worsening the overall outbreak.

He will get on social media claiming to have “figured it out” that the government is covering things up, that according to his middle school math knowledge the virus some crazy percentage of fatal, and it’s R value (something he just heard about last week) is 14, inciting other Joes to “prep” and evangelize.

He may even attempt to “identify spreaders” through huge generalizations, or worse, attempt to “pin point” individuals, through his online sleuthing, causing possible harm to come to innocent people.

In short, Joe is doing no favors to his fellow man.  And frankly, he is likely not doing any favors to himself by attempting to become an expert in virology in a month. He is, by his actions, possibly making it more likely he will be exposed to the disease (by limiting equipmentthat could be better utilized elsewhere to stop the spread before it gets to him, by making any number of half true decisions about what is safe to do based on dubious “knowledge”). He will make himself a prime target for serious infection by obsessing and staying up all night on his theories, thereby weakening his immune system. He will likely ignore any official information provided, because he will believe that the government is covering things up regardless of the truth of those statements. It is much more like an action movie that way. And of course, if the government IS covering things up, that is always a bad thing, because Joe knows how to fend for himself, as you can see by his wise actions."

But hong Kong (counting as separate from China since it’s still half a democracy with a different medical system) already has hundreds of suspected cases, japan had a few confirmed. 

I asked my mom about it, “I heard about a strange pneumonia thing in Wuhan...” 

She answered. “Oh, yeah. It’s controlled and contained.” (This was 16th of January). 

Nowadays, my parents are incredibly disillusioned about the government. (They always have been to a certain extend.) My dad is a big extravert, and he’s heard of about 7 dead cases in the community they live in when I talked to him last weekend, 2 of which are people he knew personally. Infected numbers are even higher, at least one is in their building. 

If I had to guess, the grandparents generation is very traumatized, they lived through some horrific things in the 50s, 60s. And they are victims to one of the most intense brainwashing campaigns in modern Chinese history. My grandparents on my mother’s side is honestly completely cookoo. They have an almost schizophrenic attitude towards the CCP and other Chinese people, and they can be very xenophobic. (Don’t show our bad side to foreigners.) 

And finally, in traditional Chinese culture. Lying so that you’re family isn’t worried about you is a **huge** thing. (There’s a movie that came out lately called The Farewell that talks about exactly that.) 

It’s a weird cycle where the parents lie to their kids about their situation, and the kids assume that their parents are lying so they send help anyway. And the parents will refuse despite needing help, and the kids will insist. Do that three times, parents will begrudgingly accept help. (This goes for gifts as well). It’s hard to trust what your elder family says to you. 

So, with all that in mind, i think they may be telling the truth if they are still healthy and they still have food, and that’s all they care about. Or they could be lying to keep the peace. Or they are lying to keep the face, just like how ccp fudge numbers. And of course, one account is also just one account."

>Why on EARTH should I give an inkling of a fuck about this disease, apart from the economic consequences

The serious economic consequences of this are reason enough for us all to care. But also somebody you know and care about will die from this disease, statistically speaking. This will be true for all of us. And yes, it could even be you. The only age group this hasn't killed somebody from is 0 to 9 (so far). I'm assuming you aren't 8 years old?

So if the only goal is money and private companys have to actively market, and provide service to EARN that money, vs. Government passively taking your money no matter what. Who do you think will provide a better service? Who do you think actually has an incentive to deliver promised goods?"

2020-02-21,n1ght_w1ng08,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f7fc7t/agricultural_commodities_may_get_a/fiawelv/,"Full Text : 


The coronavirus epidemic in China has raised concerns over a slowdown in the global economy, but agricultural commodities such as wheat, corn, and cattle are unlikely to suffer, and may get a boost when coronavirus worries ease analysts say.

“There will be no real demand destruction in agriculture from the coronavirus,” says Sal Gilbertie, president and chief investment officer at Teucrium Trading. “People still need to eat, which means agriculture demand will not abate.”

The coronavirus “lethargy” in grain and meat prices could provide investors with a chance to gain access to agricultural commodities prior to any Chinese buying that will occur from the U.S.-China phase-one trade agreement, he says.

Corn futures CK20, -0.59%  fell by more than 2% while wheat WK20, -0.76%   was little changed, andSK20, -0.31%  lost nearly 7% this year through Thursday. Lean hog prices LHJ20, -0.15%   declined by over 6%, with live cattle futures LCJ20, -1.59%   losing more than 5%. Cotton CTK20, -1.05%, meanwhile, trade 0.4% higher so far this year.

The rising coronavirus infection count and death tolls have had a “bearish emotional impact” on commodity prices that are most sensitive to Chinese demand, including soybeans, says Todd Hultman, lead analyst at commodity market information and analysis provider DTN.

Commodities have all reacted differently to the new coronavirus, with haven gold GCJ20, +1.72%  on the rise as oil CLJ20, -0.69%  declines on the back of expectations for lower energy demand.

In the agricultural market, lean hogs were “hit the hardest” by the coronavirus, says Craig Turner, senior commodities broker with Daniels Trading.

When phase one of the trade deal went into effect on Jan. 15, “we were expecting China to buy large amounts of pork starting on Jan. 25,” he says.

The coronavirus, however, “was gaining steam in the press in late January, and when the market started to worry about the virus,” hog prices came down, he says.

Turner believes that soybeans, beef, pork, and cotton are the “most at risk” from the virus in the short term because those are products that China buys from the U.S. Cotton, in particular, is linked to textiles and manufacturing, not food or animal feed.

Still, Hultman points out that “if and when the disease concerns stabilize, we may actually find that the Chinese government will need to make more food purchases to help cities where quarantines depleted local supplies.”

In the meantime, there have been concerns that China may not meet its trade deal obligation to purchase $36.5 billion of U.S. agricultural commodities this year and $43.5 billion in 2021, says Dan Cekander, president of grain-market service DC Analysis, adding that he believes the coronavirus has delayed Chinese buying under the trade pact.

Cekander expects China to comply with the agreement terms, but if the coronavirus remains headline news until the summer, there is “increased risk” of China asking for a reduction in its 2020 purchase obligations.

Those obligations were already “very challenging,” says Darwei Kung, head of commodities and portfolio manager at global asset manager DWS Group.

With the coronavirus, it is more likely that China would delay the implementation while the government focuses on using its resources to fight the spread of the disease, Kung says. The implementation may “only resume post-resolution’’ of the epidemic, he says.

However, the impact of the virus on food consumption is much less than that on energy consumption, says Kung.

“While people in China have traveled less or delayed factory reopenings, aggregate food consumption is less likely to be deferred or delayed,” he says."

He returned from China between 20 and 21 January, had tested negative for tests at Sacco Hospital. The Higher Institute of Health, on the other hand, confirms its positivity to the coronavirus

Patient zero of the coronavirus outbreak in Lombardy has been identified. a 28-year-old man who works at a company in Fiorenzuola d'Arda and returned from a trip to China. Initially he had tested negative at the Sacco hospital in**Milan.** But the Higher Institute of Health has confirmed that the man became ill, albeit in a lighter form. Normally the 28-year-old manager spends most of the year in **China,**with limited periods in Italy. **He returned from China between 20 and 21 January,**but was always well (and still healthy), except on February 10, when he had light flu symptoms. Immediately there had been doubts. 

Patient 1, on the other hand, **a 38-year-old man from** Codogno, also infected his wife, who was admitted to the Sacco hospital in **Milan,**and four other people living in the same area, hospitalized with a clinical picture of pneumonia. About three hundred people were examined, including **close colleagues, doctors and nurses** at the Codogno hospital who rescued him. The 38-year-old has had a very extensive social activity in the last two weeks: for example, he participated in a running race and a football match. There are 150 close contacts who will be swab-affected, plus 160 Unilever employees, who have been advised not to leave the offices pending the test. 

The Codogno emergency department is currently closed and all patients who were present at the same time as the 38-year-old **have already been contacted.** The experts of the Milan Ats and the Sanit council led by **Giulio Gallera** are reconstructing, through what are called interviews, all the contacts that man has had in the last period. After the night summit, the Health Board works tirelessly to carry out all the necessary checks and to protect public health."

San Fransisco enacted some of the stricted disease-control measures of any city in the United States, going so far as to ban public gatherings of any kind, arrest anyone who wasn't wearing a mask, mandate that hospitals only accept the most critical yet survivable flu patients, etc.  

Interestingly enough, some historians argue that it didn't reduce the disease transmission all that much!

As far as I have read, the only real people on lockdown. (Meaning that they physically can not move within the city) are the people that live in group housing in Wuhan.

This was always the interesting thing about a lot of preppers I knew online. Except for the retirees (and even then they often had familial or social obligations they were reluctant to avoid), actually *executing* the bug-out-plan was reserved solely for total collapse scenarios like a zombie movie or the complete disintegration of society and authority. Most people, even if they can stock up on food and can buy a well and a septic tank for their rural compound, can't actually abandon society and large gatherings for upwards of a month or two, let alone a year.

The Spanish Flu had mortality rates of 10-20%.

So yes, you arrogantly ignorant little person, I do think only 3-5% needing intensive care is fairly small.

> It's actually closer to 20% who need intensive care.

I'm quoting WHO, and I'd like to see your source. Or will you go with the conspiracy route and claim WHO is corrupted by China? Go on.

It is a model of what the rate of infection (at that time) would look like over the next few weeks (if left unchecked.)

What you are missing, is that China took very drastic actions to prevent that model's estimates from becoming a reality.

If China did nothing, and their infected citizens continued to travel around everywhere unrestricted, then today's reported numbers would be much (much) higher.

You are acting like the real world numbers never had a chance to play out that way, but they certainly did.   Very drastic real world actions and preventative measures (quarantines, travel bans, fumigating streets, locking people in their homes) changed the rate at which the virus spread.

It's a system for the few. I'm not doing bad by any means financially I just don't like people dying without medicine. Morality has been pushed to the wayside. 

I was born in Finland where you are taxed more for having more But yet profit is made on the world market through regulated capitalism. Rovio and Nokia dominated markets. Yet no one dies without insulin. Everyone has healthcare."

Once your body produces more antibodies than the pathogen can produce that's when you start getting better. But you're not weakening, your body is doing it's job. It's just a hellish process while it does so. 

In terms of personal hygiene, your skin is your number one defence, it's your mouth and nose that are vulnerable. Anything threatening to your health is breathed in, so if you go to the toilet for example, if people don't close the lid before they flush, you are going to breathe in all the pathogens and if someone is sick, and they have used the toilet, then there will be a virus and bacteria in the excrement. Which you breathe in if they dont close the lid before flushing. Bathrooms in general, have to be as clean as possible. Public and in your own home."

Why not? We have the internet to stay connected to loved ones these days (well until it collapses if the situatione gets bad enough).

You act like everyone in China has been exposed and was either immune or got infected. There are ~58 million people in the Hubei province alone.

Look at the cruise ship for a rough example of how contagious this disease is. Like 10% of the people onboard got sick before they were able to leave. If 10% of Hubei got sick that'd be 5.8 million people.

If China just sent everyone back to their daily lives this situation would escalate sooooo much more than it already has.

>the only thing that drastic quarantine measures achieves

...is to keep the spread of this virus at a much more manageable level than the shitshow it has potential to be. Hubei's hospitals were already flooded back when the numbers were like 9,000 confirmed. It's now over 9,000.

Can you not imagine what'd happen if 500,000 in Hubei were sick? Let alone 5,000,000.

And, just, the actual *numbers* will likely not be that bad, but the effect on the human psyche will be. It will be unprecedented within living memory. Many people remember 1957. A few even remember 1918. We won’t be able to find analogues in those events. It is possible that this will be a tragedy on a scale we haven’t seen in centuries. 

I only hope human society doesn’t collapse the way it did in Asia and Europe during the Black Plague. If it does, given modern technology and followers of today’s fanatical ideologies, who are likely to be overrepresented among survivors .... we are in for a very rough time."

It is important to have a supply chain.  Without a supply chain, people die from lack of food, lack of medicine, lack of any basic necessities.  We have built our society on ‘supply on demand’.  This means our storages are almost non-existent.  In old-fashioned terms, our silos are empty.  We have not enough wheat to survive the year.  

So your question is valid.  

On the other hand, we are facing a virus that has no cure, with a chance to kill millions of people if allowed to spread with no quarantine.  If we allowed the world to be a giant ‘plague cruise’, give it a R0 of its highest degree, we could suffer more supply chain failure than holding back a little.  

What they are doing now is best.  They are quarantining a little to slow the spread, not contain.  Containment and burnout is impossible at this point.  We are buying time to allow science to help us win a fight.  

Does that make sense?"

When I posted this certificate a few days ago I asked if a Japanese person could confirm English of that one phrase. Course the official interpretation into English says “no risk of infection”.  From a legal and ethical standpoint they should have toned it down to something like “was tested on February __ and at that time tested negative and thus may pose less risk of infection”. Or something. But of course any less language and people would say “ the Japanese in an official certificate can’t even say they are not a risk but yet they released them into wild with no safeguards”. So damned if you do and don’t.

I don't blame the people wanting to flee, that's what anyone in their position would want to do... I blame the Govt for putting the entire country at risk and allowing them to do it. Every single person that dies here because of it will be blood on the government's hands. They should be held accountable for each and every death. They should travel to the home of every dead person and publicly apologize to the family for putting political ties with China over the safety of their own citizens. And if they aren't willing to do that, then I want them to go to the airport and great every passenger from China with a hug if they are so confident there is no threat! 

We already know the threat is real. How many more will die here because of their incompetence, it's disgusting. This isn't about feelings, this isn't about racism, this isn't about being politically correct. This is literally about survival. We have a right to be upset when the survival of our families is put into jeopardy because the Government is allowing mass migration from people fleeing infected areas.

That number is easily dismissable as false, just as if I said the R0 was 25. 

We can be pretty confident the R0 is over 2 since from both data and first hand experience we know it's more infectious than SARS, and SARS had a R0 of 2 - 5. 

If the real number is 2.0 or 6.6 it doesn't really matter, both are pretty fucking bad so why take the bigger battle in trying to convince people it's the absolute high end of the estimate? The 1918 Spanish flu outbreak had a R0 of 2 - 3 and that killed 5% of the world's population. How much higher than 2.0 it is doesn't really matter at this point."

But it’s unclear where to put some of the US cases, because they evacuated a bunch (14) who tested positive just before getting on the evacuation plane.  So technically those ones belong on the ship’s count, even though they’re now in the US.  And anyone else who ends up testing positive only after the flight would be US cases (like Israel’s and Australia’s cases).   That would make sense.

But last I heard the US were actually calling the 14 “presumed positive”, rather than confirmed, and re-testing.   Since they dropped off passengers in different states and also tested a few who developed symptoms on the flight, it’s not clear whether the latest batch (11 positive out of 13 tested in Omaha) count as US or ship cases.   Tests from the other state must still be coming, because there were definitely 14 presumed positive and the Omaha only talks about testing 13 cases."

He is saying that a lot of corruption comes from older folks in positions of power, and that a cleansing of most of the elder populations would wipe out some of that. The innocents would be collateral damage, but some of the root problem might get sorted out.

I disagree with the statement as a whole, because of power vacuums and how that all works. But I dont think that individual wishes death on all old people, just the ones who engage in corrupt practices that make the little people suffer.

China says outbreak hasn't peaked; Iran and South Korea see growing case numbers

WHO concerned about coronavirus infections with no clear link to China
1 hour ago 2:51  
The WHO is increasingly concerned about COVID-19 outside China, especially in South Korea and Iran. 2:51
The latest: 

WHO director warns window to contain coronavirus outbreak is 'narrowing.' 
China says crisis hasn't peaked, situation in Hubei province 'remains severe and complex.'
Iran confirms 13 more cases of COVID-19 and 2 more deaths, for a total of 18 cases and 4 deaths.
South Korea declares health emergency in its 4th-largest city amid concern about new cases.
Canadian charter flight with Diamond Princess passengers who were cleared after 2-week quarantine lands at CFB Trenton, head to Cornwall, Ont., for 2nd quarantine.
B.C. health officials report 6th presumptive case in province.
WATCH: Experts are starting to identify patterns of how the coronavirus is spread.
The window of opportunity to contain wider international spread of the epidemic of the new coronavirus disease is closing, the World Health Organization warned on Friday, and countries must act fast if they are to control it.

Asked whether the outbreak is at a ""tipping point"" after new cases of infections and deaths from COVID-19 were reported in Iran and Lebanon, the WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he still believed the virus could be contained, but noted that ""the window of opportunity is narrowing, so we need to act quickly before it closes completely.""

""This outbreak could go in any direction,"" Tedros said as he encouraged countries to keep working on containment while also stepping up measures to prepare for the possibility of more widespread transmission.

""We must not look back and regret that we failed to take advantage of the window of opportunity we have.""

The daily WHO briefing came after Chinese officials said the coronavirus outbreak there has not yet reached its peak.

""A turning point in the development of the national epidemic situation has not yet arrived,"" concluded the meeting, chaired by President Xi Jinping, according to state television.

""The epidemic prevention and control situation in Hubei province and Wuhan city remains severe and complex.""

The ruling Communist Party and the government should not relax but ""unceasingly consolidate achievements and extend combat successes,"" it said.

China has portrayed its efforts to control the virus, which has killed more than 2,200 and infected more than 75,000, as a war of containment.

Hubei revised the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections upward to 631 on Friday, after including cases in the province's prison systems.

All-out efforts should be made in Beijing's epidemic control work, it said. The number of cases of coronavirus in the capital has jumped sharply while many other parts of the country beyond Hubei are reporting fewer or no new infections.

The impact of the coronavirus outbreak on China's economy is obvious, but the economy's long-term improving momentum will not change, the meeting said. Fiscal policy in China will be more proactive, monetary policy will be more flexible and the government will fend off systemic financial risks, it added.

Iran and South Korea report additional cases
Iran confirmed 13 new coronavirus cases and two deaths among the group of new cases, Health Ministry spokesperson Kianush Jahanpur said in a tweet on Friday.

The new cases comprised seven people diagnosed in Qom, four in Tehran and two in Gilan, Jahanpur said in the tweet.

The total number of cases in Iran now stands at 18, with four of those people having died.

In South Korea, the government banned major rallies in its capital and declared a health emergency in its fourth-largest city as 100 new virus cases were reported Friday, bringing the country's total to 204.

Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun said in a televised statement the central government will concentrate its support to the southeastern region to ease a shortage in sickbeds, medical personnel and equipment.

""A month into the outbreak, we have entered an emergency phase,"" Chung said. ""Our efforts until now had been focused on blocking the illness from entering the country. But we will now shift the focus on preventing the illness from spreading further in local communities.""

The spike forced officials to focus on steps to contain the domestic spread of the disease, not just its entry from abroad.

Most of the new cases have been reported since Wednesday. The increase, especially in and around Daegu city in the southeast, has raised fears the outbreak is overwhelming the region's medical system. Many of the cases have been linked to a church in the city.
