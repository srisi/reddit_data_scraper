gestern habe ich einen Artikel gelesen, dass der Atienmarkt die Hoffnung auf den ""dummen Käufer"" darstellt. Die Quelle finde ich nicht.

Man kann sich ja schön über die Bewertung in seinem Depot freuen, ein realer Wert entsteht aber nur, wenn man einen Käufer findet (und sein Geld dann sinnvoll ausgeben kann). Dieser Käufer ist dann der, der auf einen höheren Gewinn spekuliert. Solange die Notenbanken Gas geben, ist alles gut.

Wenn es zur Krise kommt, z. B. durch eine Pandemie mit Coronavirus (glaube ich nicht!), dann haben die den (strukturellen) Vorteil, die die ausreichende Finanzmacht haben, damit sich ganz viele Leute mit desem Thema beschäftigen können. 

Erfolg an der Börse ist wie Lotto: den Gewinn des einen bezahlen die anderen. Nur strukturell bedingt, verdient einer besser. Man kann also Glück haben oder strukturell bevorzugt sein.

Ich kannte mal jemanden, der mit Wetten zockte und 5 Millionen im Monat umsetzte. Der  hatte sich eine Software geschrieben, die seine Chancen erhöhte und automatisch kaufte. Er meinte, die Großen gewinnen, die Kleinen zahlen. Natürlich nicht im Einzelfall, sondern statistisch. Wenn von seinen 5 Mill. im Monat 20.000,- € ""Gewinn"" übrigbleiben, sei das doch gut! Bezahlt haben das die Kleinen. Man braucht auch keine 5 Millionen auf dem Konto, man muss das Geld nur schnell genug rotieren lassen.

Recht hat er.

Da die Großen alle technologisch aufgerüstet haben, bleibt die Frage, wo die kleinen bleiben. Gut, wenn man einen Hedgefonds hat, der durch das FED gerettet wird.

Ich habe mal jemandem vorgeschlagen, wir gründen eine Sekte, um Geld einzusammeln. Antwort: ""Bist Du blöd: wir lassen uns gleich anbeten!"" Nicht Mister Dax, sondern in Goddax we trust! Die Startfinanzierung über Crowdfunding.  Gebt uns Geld, wir setzen es für einen guten Zweck ein. Schon mal die Gehälter vom Chef des ADAC, Greenpeace, Wikipedia und Amnesty International gesehen?

Ich mache etwas falsch!

2020-01-22,DontDoAHit,HealthAnxiety,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/eryexo/terrified_of_the_wuhan_virus_spreading/ff8i7ff/,"Amazing post! Also just wanted to add to the above wonderful tips for staying healthy through any flu season:

1. Wash your hands not just before eating, but also before touching your mouth, nose, eyes, ears, and before/after you use the restroom! Don’t touch your face or ears with unwashed hands. This DRASTICALLY reduces transmission of germs. 

2. Hand sanitizer or sani wipes are nice to keep around when you’re on the go (grocery store, work, large crowds, etc.), makes things easier so you don’t have to find a sink and soap. 

3. Cook your meat and eggs well! Use proper food handling procedures. Google can provide you with an array of tips for safe food temperatures and preventing cross-contamination of foods. Clean up after any raw meat, wash your hands often while cooking. 

4. Avoid close quarters with others in large crowds if you want to reduce the possibility of germ spread. It should also go without saying — avoid closeness with people who appear ill or are known to be sick (unless you have taken the proper precautions/gear). 

5. N95 respirator masks are very helpful if you live/work somewhere that large crowds or ill people are unavoidable for you. Masks often protect others from YOUR germs more than they protect you from OTHERS — but NIOSH-approved N95 respirator masks with a good seal around your nose and mouth have been proven to help reduce transmission of airborne particles. If you want to take it a step further for some reason in a riskier situation, you can use one of the long N95 respirator masks that covers your eyes as well. Eye protection is especially important if you KNOW someone you’ll be handling is ill. 

6. Sneeze into tissues, dispose of them properly, and wash/sanitize your hands immediately after. Cough into a tissue and follow the same protocol above, or if no tissue is available, cough into the crook of your elbow to avoid spreading airborne droplets to others around you easily. 

I know these tips seem kind of stringent but really, the best defense against any bug, coronavirus or not, is good hygiene and sanitation. All of these above practices are proven effective to help reduce spread of germs. This will help not only you, but those around you.  Eat healthy, exercise, drink water, sleep well, and do your part to reduce transmission! Be well, friends!✌️"
2020-01-22,Akid0uu,pics,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/es9a03/thermostatic_checks_in_south_korea_to_identify/ff8kfb1/,"**What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus?**
According to the WHO, the new coronavirus causes a fever, fatigue, sore throat and dry cough in the early stages of the disease. As the illness progresses, patients may experience difficulty breathing. 

But these symptoms – similar to many other respiratory diseases – are what make it so difficult to control.

The virus was initially described by Chinese authorities as a new strain of pneumonia, but was later confirmed to be a novel coronavirus. 

These are a family of viruses that originate in animals before making the jump to humans. Seven, including the new virus, have been found in humans, with four causing only mild, common-cold like symptoms.

But two – Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) – are much more severe, having killed more than 1,500 people between them. 

**How are coronaviruses transmitted? **
Like other coronaviruses – such as the common cold – the virus is spread via droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. 

It can also be spread when someone touches a contaminated surface such as a door handle. 

Hospitals are also a key place for viruses to spread. When patients arrive in hospital with vague respiratory symptoms health workers may not know they need to take special precautions such as wearing masks. Other patients may also be at risk. 

The outbreak is thought to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan which also traded in other animals such as marmots and bats.

But what animal the disease originally came from is still unknown, as is how easily the disease spreads between people. WHO and the Chinese authorities initially said there was “limited” human-to-human transmission but the pace of the outbreak would suggest that it spreads more easily than first thought. 

**Can the new coronavirus be treated?**
There are no specific treatments for coronaviruses – just as there is no treatment for the common cold. Anyone with a severe form of the disease will receive antiviral medicine and support for symptoms.

Patients may need ventilation to assist breathing as well as support for their vital organs."
2020-01-22,keel_bright,China,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/erszdd/disease_control_with_chinese_characteristics_man/ff8nlz6/,"I promise you that I am not being purposefully dense or ignorant. I am trying to give perspective from the healthcare and public health point of view. Okay, let's look at this another way. This virus has been around since Mid-December, so just over a month now. Remember that China, with its density, air quality, and sanitation issues, is a much better place for the virus to transmit than the first world.

As of a few hours ago, news outlets say there are 440 cases of this Coronavirus and 9 deaths overall.

So far this winter, [there have been](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#S6) 13,000,000 cases of influenza in the USA alone - resulting in 120,000 hospitalizations and 6,600 deaths. 

I don't have reliable flu numbers for China, but given that the WHO estimates between 290,000 to 650,000 worldwide deaths annually, you can be assured that the number of cases is far higher. I hope that puts it in perspective.

Can you imagine if you got the flu and a physician told you ""we need to isolate you and put you in a hospital bed""? No, because that's not how it works. We reserve hospital beds for people who are collapsing or dying right there and then, because beds are expensive and scarce. EVEN if I was certain you had Coronavirus, I would not necessarily put you in a bed unless you were dying - because 9 deaths in 440, or 2% mortality risk, does not warrant you hogging up a bed until you MAYBE start dying.

&#x200B;

But if someone comes up to me with a cough and fever, I am much more likely to suspect influenza. If I am physically in Wuhan during this outbreak and a local patient tells me about their cough and fever, I'm still much more likely to suspect and treat it as influenza. The balance of probabilities is extremely overweighted to the flu. Now, if a hundred patients come through the emergency department door daily with respiratory illness, how do we get them all isolated until the sequencing results come back? 

I bet the hospital in Wuhan is still sending people home who have respiratory illness every single day."

- Novel Coronavirus is transmitted human to human and through respiratory fluid. 
- Localized health practices are of dubious quality. Coughing, sneezing in the open, no face masks. 
- free traveling for holidays/no quarantine

An R0 of 1 means every patient, on average, infects 1 other person. 

If the R0 is less than 1, the infection will die out. If it's greater than 1, it will spread.

A nightmare pandemic scenario is one with a high R0, a long incubation period, airborne or at least aerosol spread, with patients that are infectious before symptoms and/or mobile after they're sick, with symptoms that can be mistaken for something else, and which has a relatively low CFR (case fatality rate) in the beginning but which produces a LOT of people who need hospital care and will succumb without it.  

Ebola, for example, has a very high CFR and people die dramatic, ugly deaths relatively quickly. They aren't infectious, however, until they start showing symptoms and they are rapidly disabled. It has a short incubation period. It's also not airborne. The high CFR motivates people to quarantine the hell out of the disease, and between that, and the fact that someone with Ebola is probably not going to get on a train and travel (at least, not often or far) and the short incubation period, it has not become a pandemic. 

This new coronavirus ... there's a lot of questions, but I'm not liking the answers we're getting so far. It's not looking like it would be a civilization ending event if it were to get loose, but it has the potential to be bad if some of the unanswered questions end up having ""bad news"" answers."

More than 6 have died btw, an estimated 200 - 2000 have died or are infected terminally with it, the reason we say only about 9 have died as of right now is because China censors the real numbers, but insiders and brave doctors get information for such diseases out so we can have accurate data.

Flu strains like the current coronavirus are a lot more dangerous than measles or polio. I do agree though that not all diseases are equal, but measles and chickenpox are the most benign of diseases possible. More people are killed by the flu than by measles or chickenpox, yet people will generally regard the flu as benign.

So I don't blame you for thinking that measles is deadly, because that is how it's been portrayed to the public. However if you objectively look at the evidence, most other diseases kill more people that become infected. 

>  As we’ve seen with those measles outbreaks, people who don’t get vaccinated spread it among those close to them, and abroad when they travel. 

And as we have also seen, nobody in the US has died from measles since 2015, despite all these outbreaks. This is what defines it as benign, not the fact that people catch it.

I mean if you want to classify a disease as deadly, not by the number of people killed, but by the number of people that catch it, then every disease is essentially deadly. You have no way to rank diseases in different levels, everything to you is max risk.

> Hell, I know someone for whom measles is actually deadly due to a prior sensitivity. She relies on herd immunity for her safety.

It's not deadly if she is still alive. Also suggesting that if she ever catches it, then she will die is no different than saying she'll die from any other disease. Again, nobody has died in the us from measles since 2015 despite thousands of cases.

> to skip a totally safe vaccine to put someone like her at obvious risk.

Totally safe? Here are the governments own safety statistics: https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vaccine-compensation/data/data-statistics-vicp.pdf

As you can see on page 5, 62 people have died from the MMR vaccine over the past couple of decades. How can you describe something that as ""totally"" safe and yet has killed people? Yet measles hasn't killed anyone since 2015 and it's deadly. 

> Before vaccines a lot of people had certajn diseases. Many got sick. Many died. After vaccines a lot less people got sick. A lot less people died. In some instances the disease straight up got wiped off the map. That’s an easy, binary reason to support vaccines’ widespread use. 

The problem with your logic here is that you're saying that the only thing to change in medical science over the past century has been vaccines. Nothing else has advanced to help people survive disease. No medicines, supportive measures or diagnostics. To you the ""binary"" choice is take vaccines or die miserably in the street.

Doesn't this seem a bit extreme? Can't you admit that other things played a role in peoples survival, while also saying that vaccine helped as well?

>  Vaccine scares and drops in use only came about AFTER a falsified medical study linked them to autism

If you're referring to Wakefields study, his study explicitly says that there was no evidence linking vaccines to anything. You've never read the study and you're only forming your opinion on what other people have told you to believe about the study. if this was any other topic, you'd be ashamed of blindly following what other people told you, yet because this is such a popular topic, you assume that it must be true without doing any checking for yourself.

> And no one is shaming those spreading the coronavirus

See this is my point. Coronavirus objectively kills more people than measles and yet you make it sound perfectly fine for these people to walk around in public. It's hypocritical for you to say everyone must vaccinate, yet not say that every sick person should quarantine themselves."

Sometimes it's more communicable; sometimes it's more deadly, other times it's confined to or passed from certain animals. Sooner or later we'll get a real killer epidemic. Still, even though this one seems a milder strain, it does spread fairly well human to human through surface contact, so it has the potential to kill infants, elderly, and immune compromised people in significant numbers.

The last article I read about that specific outbreak, which they were working to contain, was mid to late December. 

Then, according to [Coronavirus timelines](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-pneumonia-china-virus-coronavirus-timeline-spread-12294320) the WHO   was altered by the Chinese government about a string of pneumonia like outbreaks in Wuhan on December 31st.

If you read the article OP posted, you know the recent developments.

Nothing I'm reading ties the two outbreaks together - It appears that the coronavirus and pneumonic plague are totally different viruses, that just have similar symptoms and originate from the same area of the world.

But damn, when you look at the timeline it would ostensibly make sense if they were the same. And the conspiracy keeps creeping into my head, since the word ""coronavirus"" is a little easier to take in than ""pneumonic plague"". Either way, that's a couple really serious outbreaks from the same neck of the woods."

>SARS vaccine: A vaccine to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

No licensed vaccine had hitherto been developed for any human coronavirus. Other coronaviruses are among the viruses that cause the common cold.

I think people need to put numbers into perspective with this. a couple hundred people getting a new virus is notable and organizations like the CDC should be on high alert. Not because we're all going to die, but because it's their job to study and measure outbreaks and new viruses the moment they're discovered. The more rapidly they understand and assess the behavior of the virus the better. 

That being said, any Coronavirus strain is less severe in symptoms and mortality than the weakest Influenza strain and only 45% of us actually get the flu shot because we don't view it as a threat. If we're not afraid of getting the Flu, we shouldn't be afraid of getting Coronavirus."

**Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Bat Coronavirus Closely Related to the Direct Progenitor of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.**

We report the isolation and characterization of a novel bat coronavirus which is much closer to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in genomic sequence than others previously reported, particularly in its S gene. Cell entry and susceptibility studies indicated that this virus can use ACE2 as a receptor and infect animal and human cell lines. Our results provide further evidence of the bat origin of the SARS-CoV and highlight the likelihood of future bat coronavirus emergence in humans.

The candidate, Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, spoke of how new arrivals to New York were “hijacking” apartments from longtime residents.

“Go back to Iowa,” Mr. Adams, a Democrat, said on Monday at the Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network headquarters in Harlem, at his annual Martin Luther King’s Birthday event. “You go back to Ohio. New York City belongs to the people that was here and made New York City what it is.”

His comments struck at a broader anxiety across all five boroughs about gentrification and affordability, and whether those forces have homogenized the city for the worse.

Continue reading the main story
In neighborhoods across the city, in places like Harlem, Washington Heights, Long Island City and Bushwick, residential and commercial rents have risen, displacing longtime businesses and residents, and upending the character of those areas.

Yet some leaders in New York suggested that Mr. Adams had gone too far. Indeed, Mr. Adams on Tuesday sought to clarify his comments, signaling that he did not, in fact, want newer residents to start packing their bags.

“I welcome all people of good will to New York City — no matter who they are and where they come from,” Mr. Adams said in a statement.

But Mr. Adams, who declined to be interviewed, reiterated his larger point that newcomers should invest in their neighborhoods. New Yorkers have a right to be angry with anyone who “disrespects the people who have built the neighborhoods they enjoy.”

Continue reading the main story
In his speech, Mr. Adams said his goal was to make people feel uncomfortable in the spirit of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His speech focused on his frustration that problems plaguing the black community, from drug addiction to homelessness, are not viewed as a crisis until they start to affect white people.

The fact that Mr. Adams, a former police captain who is black, named Iowa and Ohio, two largely white states, could alienate some voters in a wide-open Democratic primary for mayor, where Mr. Adams is an early front-runner.

“For some of his constituents, it’s maybe a dog whistle to gentrification and the changing composition of the borough,” said Christina M. Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University. “But for quite a few New Yorkers who are transplants, it’s a pretty divisive message. In a crowded mayoral field, you want to be as inclusive as possible.”

Within hours of Mr. Adams’s initial comments, Mayor Bill de Blasio pushed back against his inflammatory stance, even though Mr. Adams is a friend of the mayor’s.

“It’s not my impression he said it the right way — the fact is it’s a city for everyone,” Mr. de Blasio said in an interview on NY1. “So many New Yorkers have come here recently and are contributing a lot to the city.”

Affordability will likely be a central issue in the race to succeed Mr. de Blasio — a theme that two other candidates emphasized at Mr. Sharpton’s event on Monday, an annual rite of passage for city and state leaders. The candidates, Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, pledged to focus on creating more affordable housing.

Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat in his second and final term, ran in 2013 on the theme that New York City had become a “tale of two cities” — split between the haves and the have-nots — and he vowed to battle inequality. But many New Yorkers believe he has not done enough to tackle the problem.

“That narrative is more important now than ever because the mayor has not gotten us any closer to a solution,” Professor Greer said.

In Mr. Adams’s statement on Tuesday, he encouraged all New Yorkers to “respect each other and seek to alleviate, and not exacerbate, the problems that we face.”

But where exactly do these new New Yorkers come from? Many are moving here from California and Florida, and not exactly the cornfields of Iowa, according to a 2018 report by StreetEasy, the real estate website. Many others are foreign immigrants.

Each borough tends to have its own migration patterns. Brooklyn, for instance, attracts more people from San Francisco than Los Angeles; Staten Island often attracts people from the suburbs surrounding New York City.

As for when a transplant becomes a true New Yorker — after a decade or two? Once you kick a subway rat or stop toasting your bagels? There is no clear answer.

Longtime residents of East Harlem said Mr. Adams was speaking to real concerns in traditionally black neighborhoods, even if they did not agree with his comments. Blacks are no longer a majority of the population in Harlem, a famed mecca for black America.

Vanessa Robinson said she has lived in the same East Harlem building for 60 years.

“It really has changed,” Ms. Robinson, 65, said of the neighborhood. “Over the last five years, there’s been more of a push. The rents did go up.”

But Ms. Robinson, who is black, said she did not agree with Mr. Adams’s comments. Her late husband was white, and her son is biracial.

“But the anger is boiling over now,” she said. “As far as equality and pushing people out, that’s a big problem. People resent it.”

On Monday, Mr. Adams was not the only mayoral candidate who focused on the downsides that booming economic growth and a surging city population had wrought on certain neighborhoods. The real estate industry has become a target in recent elections as a common enemy of Democratic voters.

Mr. Stringer criticized the city’s recent rezoning plans, which invite an influx of new development, saying they took place in diverse neighborhoods like Inwood and East New York, and not in wealthier neighborhoods like Park Slope and the Upper East Side.

Mr. Johnson said the city was facing an affordability crisis and highlighted his efforts to set aside more units for the homeless in affordable-housing projects.

Juanita Lanzo, 46, a visual artist and curator from Puerto Rico, said she lives in a rent-stabilized apartment in East Harlem and worries about losing her home.

“They need protection for tenants that live in these buildings,” she said, “and that is the key.”"

SARS and MERS are Coronavirus and those have a higher mortality rate than the Spanish Flu of 1918 that killed over 50 million people. The thing is SARS and MERS spread slowly and are not as contagious as your regular ""common cold"" Coronavirus. This new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently falling between SARS and the common cold. It has a much lower mortality rate than SARS, but so far appears to have a higher mortality rate than seasonal flu. It also seems to spread more easily than SARS or MERS. There is valid reason to worry as a virus with a fairly low mortality rate (around 2-5%) can still manage to kill millions if it able to spread quickly in a population. The Spanish Flu of 1918 had an estimated mortality rate of 2-3%, but it still managed to kill anywhere from 50-100 million people. This was because it was so damn infections, nearly 1/3 of the global population at the time contracted the virus. 2019-nCoV can still be a major threat even if it isn't killing a lot of people. The fact it appears to be quickly spreading should be alarming."

My point wasn't that by virtue of being democratic the U.S. or UK or Germany or whomever could whip some magical cure out of its back pocket and start distributing it.

Rather, it's twofold. First, China intentionally permits a food distribution system that causes these kinds of outbreaks. There's a reason for all the regulations in our food system.

Secondly, dictatorships in crises like this tend to make matter worse by trying to suppress information. This isn't even me speculating: the last time a novel viral outbreak happened in China, and even specifically a coronavirus one i.e. SARS, they **did** make matters worse by trying to do exactly that."

I'm definitely a bit cautious accepting some of the early data from China, but now there are global organisations working on it, I'm less concerned.

But this published yesterday suggests it won't be too much of a problem:

> this new virus showed that its S protein only binds weakly to the ACE2 receptor on human cells whereas the human SARS coronavirus exhibits strongly affinity to the ACE receptor. These findings suggest that the new virus does not readily transmit between humans and should theoretically not able to cause very serious human infection.

Another risk factor to look at is the sanitary living/work conditions and access to medical assistance in poverished areas.

Current estimates for this new strain of coronavirus (nCoV) show at least 500 people in 7 countries have been infected of those there have been 17 confirmed deaths however this is still really early

Some perspective data I pulled up on other outbreaks from WHO and CDC..

If we look at the SARS  coronavirus and the 2003 epidemic, lasted about 6 months. it was reported that 8,100 people were infected in 29 countries of those 774 died. CDC rates SARS at a BSL-2

Another coronavirus, MERS started in 2012-2015, its reported 2,500 infected in 27 countries of those 858 died. CDC rated it at BSL-3

Ebola is a diff type of virus but to put in perspective, cdc rates it a BSL-4. Outbreaks are still happening in west Africa. But from 2014-2016 mainly west africa countries, but reported in at least 7 other countries reported 28,000 people infected and 11,000 deaths

Also lets review the black plague, in the 14th century was caused by bacteria from rats /fleas due to the un-hygenic and un-sanitary conditions of the time, the virus spread easily due to this.  roughly 50 million people died or 60% of Europe at the time.

Not at all. Japanese airports have screening for any illnesses coming into the country, you'll walk past some cameras that detect temperatures and if you're ill you're supposed to declare it and be examined by a doctor and possibly quarantined. If you're not clearly dying when you get there then nobody cares if you have a sniffle. It's to stop potentially outbreaks of catastrophic diseases coming into the country. 

I think the media and everyone else are being very dramatic about this whole thing but anyone who is elderly or vulnerable should be extra cautious. I'd recommend wearing masks to travel either way as planes are good places to catch all sorts of things."

Basically, the fact that Chinese markets tend to keep animals like seafood and chickens live until they need to be slaughtered because of the cultural reasons (I’m half Korean and this is the case over there too, being influenced by them) because of the idea in traditional Chinese medicine of the... energies of the meat being best when it’s fresh as possible, including wild variants like boars and birds. Also, certain animals like swine are grown en masse over there, and the priority is volume over quality so the way they’re raised is less safe.

The public reaction is a bit overblown perhaps, it’s morbidity and mortality are not known yet. But a strong vigilant reaction is always better than a lax one.

This is what SARS was, this is what this is. It's a thing that happens and it's rarely fatal and often when it is fatal it's because of per-existing conditions like other illnesses, being really old or really young.

If you want to be afraid of something that has a real chance of killing you my I introduce you to the wonder world of [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer). 

That not only kills way way waaaaaay more people it's already wherever you live and can strike without any warning and make you dead in weeks.

[La evolución del **coronavirus de Wuhan**](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/21/actualidad/1579632773_114458.html), que afecta ya al menos a 470 personas, ha provocado que Pekín haya ordenado cerrar las redes de transporte público —metro, autobús, ferry y larga distancia— de esta urbe, situada en el medio del territorio nacional y hogar de 11 millones de personas, a partir de las 10 de la mañana del jueves. En una escueta circular publicada por el Centro de Control y Prevención de la Neumonía se prohíbe que ningún ciudadano ""salga de Wuhan sin razones especiales hasta nuevo aviso"".

 ""La cantidad de casos identificados está aumentando porque tenemos una mayor comprensión de la enfermedad, mejores métodos de diagnóstico y más recursos movilizados"", ha apuntado esta mañana Li Bin, vicepresidente de la Comisión Nacional de Sanidad, en una rueda de prensa para informar sobre la evolución del coronavirus. El Ejecutivo maneja ahora la hipótesis de que el virus 2019-nCov, [descubierto hace dos semanas](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/09/actualidad/1578556344_366873.html), haya mutado, lo que complicaría su tratamiento. Ante la posibilidad de que crezcan los casos con los millones de desplazamientos que se producirán en los próximos días con motivo del año nuevo chino, ha recomendado a los ciudadanos que eviten viajar a Wuhan, epicentro del brote surgido el pasado diciembre. 

 El número creciente de positivos —de 41 afectados el pasado viernes a 470 este mismo miércoles— llega dos días después de las instrucciones de la dirección del Partido Comunista, que [amenazó este lunes con castigar a quienes maquillen la realidad](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/21/actualidad/1579603091_184823.html). ""Todo aquel que no diga la verdad será clavado al pilar de la vergüenza para toda la eternidad"", dijo el lunes Chan An Jian, perfil oficial en redes sociales de la Comisión Central de Asuntos Políticos y Jurídicos. El portavoz ha asegurado este miércoles que el Gobierno no ha escondido ningún dato hasta la fecha y se ha comprometido a ""seguir ofreciendo información hasta que deje de ser necesaria"".

 Los principales esfuerzos y la mayoría de los casos, en fin, se concentran de momento en Wuhan. La investigación tiene como prioridad identificar las fuentes del virus, ya que podría haber más focos, además del mercado de pescados y mariscos de Huanan, el original. En esta zona, donde “se comercializaba con animales vivos de manera ilegal” y en cuarentena desde hace semanas, es donde el patógeno habría entrado en contacto con seres humanos por primera vez, según ha señalado durante la conferencia de prensa Gao Fu, director del Centro de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades.

 El segundo objetivo pasa por saber más acerca de las vías de transmisión de la enfermedad, vinculada con el tracto respiratorio y que provoca síntomas similares a los de una neumonía ordinaria. “Todavía estamos reuniendo información sobre el virus, cuanto más sepamos más efectivos seremos en nuestra acción”, ha manifestado el investigador, añadiendo que “la existencia de superpropagadores [infectados altamente contagiosos] no está probada”. La escalada de este nuevo coronavirus recuerda a la del [SARS](//elpais.com/tag/sars/a), con el que guarda similitudes genéticas. La epidemia de 2002, también originada en China, [causó la muerte de 700 personas en todo el mundo](//elpais.com/diario/2003/05/11/sociedad/1052604001_850215.html).

 El coronavirus actual se ha extendido a ciudades como Pekín y Shanghái, y también a las regiones autónomas de Macao y Hong Kong, que han confirmado este miércoles sus primeros casos. También se han informado de personas infectadas en Taiwán, Corea del Sur, Tailandia, Japón y Estados Unidos. Varios países han comenzado a aplicar controles sanitarios a los viajeros procedentes de China. El aeropuerto británico de Heathrow creará áreas separadas para los pasajeros procedentes de regiones afectadas por el virus, según ha anunciado este miércoles el ministro de Transportes, Grant Shapps. 

 Las autoridades locales recomiendan evitar las aglomeraciones de gente y los mercados con animales vivos, ventilar las viviendas con regularidad y acudir a un centro médico de inmediato en caso de padecer fiebre, tos o problemas respiratorios. Para fomentar las detecciones tempranas, el Gobierno ha anunciado que sufragará todos los costes derivados del tratamiento.

 Li Bin también ha reconocido que la proximidad del [año nuevo chino](//elpais.com/tag/ano_nuevo_chino/a) supone un factor de alto riesgo para la expansión del brote. Durante la semana de vacaciones que sigue a esta festividad, que este año tendrá lugar el próximo sábado 25 de enero, es costumbre visitar a parientes o viajar al extranjero, lo que resulta en más de 3.000 millones de desplazamientos, [la mayor migración humana del mundo](//elpais.com/elpais/2018/02/12/album/1518429270_849260.html). Por ello, el representante ha comunicado la toma de “medidas de alta eficacia para asegurar el desarrollo de un Festival de la Primavera (como se conoce a la celebración) armonioso y estable”.

 Estas pasan por la disposición de recursos de emergencia; la instalación de controles de temperatura en estaciones de trenes, puertos y aeropuertos; así como la implementación de límites legales a la venta de animales vivos. Del mismo modo, el Gobierno ha elevado la respuesta a nivel nacional por medio de la creación de un grupo de trabajo específico formado por representantes de 32 agencias e instituciones públicas, con el propósito de “mejorar la coordinación entre distintas áreas de trabajo para que el esfuerzo en materia de control y prevención sea multidimensional”.

 Li Bin también se ha remitido a las declaraciones de Zhong Nanshan, director del Laboratorio Estatal de Enfermedades Infecciosas en Cantón y eminencia nacional en la materia, quien ha recomendado que en los próximos días nadie visite Wuhan ni abandone la población en caso de estar ya allí, lo que “contribuirá a reducir los riesgos de contagio y transmisión”.

 En su intervención, Li Bin se ha congratulado por la gestión de la crisis hasta la fecha: “Desde el primer momento en el que el virus fue descubierto el pasado 1 de enero, hicimos planes inmediatos para gestionar la situación y sintetizamos su secuencia genética; todos estos esfuerzos han mantenido los casos graves y los fallecimientos en niveles mínimos”. “La dirección del Partido y el Consejo de Estado se toman esta cuestión con mucha seriedad y siempre ponen la salud pública como primera prioridad. Bajo el liderazgo del Partido [Comunista de China] y de Xi Jinping seremos capaces de vencer esta enfermedad”, ha sentenciado. La Organización Mundial de la Salud, que había programado una reunión de emergencia para la tarde de este miércoles y una posterior rueda de prensa, [ha pospuesto a este jueves su decisión sobre declarar o no la emergencia internacional](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/22/actualidad/1579707802_941291.html) ante el brote del nuevo coronavirus.

Modern people are particularly at risk, because even though we have better medicine, we are much more connected than ever before. Even in pre-modern times things like the black death reeked havoc across Europe and Asia just because of the small amount of trade between the two places. When Europeans landed in the Americas they spread disease that the local people weren't immune to that killed, by some estimates, close to 80% of the people living there. Now, with how easy and common it is for people to travel a true pandemic could easily spread all over the world in a short time.

The coronavirus, this epidemic out of China, is serious, but from what we know about it, it probably won't be devastating. However, one day, eventually there will be a disease that's deadly and highly contagious that will kill millions of people. Will it wipe our species out and collapse society? We don't know, but probably not. We've survived horrible plagues in the past without knowing anything about disease, so we'll probably survive again.

Have the points for first class but only interested if it's a long haul flight. 

Leave and come back before March 31 (using rolled over vacation days, have up to 20 days but don't think I can realistically use them all and effectively take the rest of the quarter off)

Surgical masks are used as a physical barrier to protect the user from hazards, such as splashes of large droplets of blood or body fluids.

Surgical masks also protect other people against infection from the person wearing the surgical mask. Such masks trap large particles of body fluids that may contain bacteria or viruses expelled by the wearer.

Surgical masks are not designed or certified to prevent the inhalation of small airborne contaminants.

>But you know what they’re great for? Protecting against bodily fluids that enter the air during a cough/sneeze

Except they really aren't. 

>which is what the CDC recommends for coronavirus on their website

From the CDC website:

No, they recommend patients who are sick use a surgical mask.

[Although routes of transmission have yet to be definitively determined, CDC recommends a cautious approach to interacting with patients under investigation. Ask such patients to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/novel-coronavirus-china)

The CCP has been suppressing the true numbers of infected, just as they did for SARS in 2003. 

The CCP official estimate is (to the best of my knowledge) currently around 300, but the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis estimates 1700+. This number is specifically ""the potential number of symptomatic cases with disease severity of a level requiring hospitalisation"" and NOT ""cases with mild or no symptoms"" which could nevertheless be contagious and undetected.

Source:
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/

Furthermore, the CCP censorship and info control apparatus has evolved significantly since 2003. The CCP is actively deleting social media posts self-reporting infections, and social media reports which point out shortcomings of the medical screening system. For example, one man reported that his mother contracted the illness, but was never tested for the virus. When she died shortly thereafter, men in hazmat suits immediately cremated her body but didn't list her as one of the infected. The CCP internet censors deleted his posts. 

Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/erszdd/disease_control_with_chinese_characteristics_man

Additionally, other citizens are reporting that hospitals are *not* testing for coronavirus, possibly because they lack resources/training or possibly because they just don't want to be the hospital that reports the bad news.

They are called coronaviruses because they are literally shaped like a corona. 

Over the millennia that humans have been getting colds from coronaviruses, the virus has either “mellowed” to be not deadly, or more likely humans over this time have evolved to not be so susceptible to dying from a coronavirus infection. (Those humans with mutations that made them more resilient against such an infection lived to pass their genes, while those without didn’t reproduce in enough numbers to survive over time). 

This is so dangerous because it is a “novel” coronavirus. Novel meaning new. New meaning that such an infection has not occurred in humans before. Meaning we have no, or limited immunity defenses against such an infection. Meaning this pandemic will be more infectious and more deadly."

*It’s believed that Asian Football Confederation officials are actively seeking an alternative venue to the city of Wuhan for the qualifying tournament which is meant to kick off on Monday week, and an announcement is expected within hours.*

*The games are likely to be played on the same dates in early February but in a new location. With cases reported in the US and across Asia, the epidemic has sparked alarm over both the football matches and also an Olympic boxing qualifying tournament due to be held in Wuhan at the same time.*

*Football Federation Australia is still waiting for official confirmation of the decision to switch the women’s Olympic football qualifiers, but the Australian players union has made clear it believes that has to happen.*

*The IOC’s boxing taskforce is due to make a decision this week on whether to move its event from Wuhan, and Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) urged the Asian Football Confederation to take its own action and avoid athletes – as well as spectators and officials – being put in harm’s way.*

*“There’s no doubt the AFC understands the importance of this, and based on the evidence we’ve seen, it’s imperative the games are moved away from Wuhan,” said PFA CEO John Didulica.*

*“Without being alarmist, the welfare of the athletes is paramount and we don’t see the need to take unnecessary risks.*

*“The key thing for us is that the FFA is continuing to brief the players and avoid any undue anxiety over this situation.”*

*FFA has been in contact with consular officials and the Department of Foreign Affairs for several weeks, but contingency planning has intensified with the spread of the so-called coronavirus, one that is transmitted from animals to humans.*

*“We are carefully monitoring the developing coronavirus situation and are in regular dialogue with the Australian Government and Asian Football Confederation as well as ley medical experts,” said an FFA spokesperson. “The safety and wellbeing of players and staff is of paramount importance.”*

*Now that a number of cases of human-to-human transmission have been confirmed, global measures to control the outbreak have included widespread screening of passengers travelling from Wuhan.*

*In the city itself, public officials including police and bank staff are wearing face masks and the Matildas were due to be given similar apparatuses.*

*The virus, similar to but not the same as the SARS epidemic of 2003, is thought to have originated in a so-called wet market where fish and livestock are bought and sold alive.*

*Initially those suffering all had a direct link to the market, but its rapid spread has caused alarm levels to rise equally quickly.*

*The IOC’s boxing task force said it would “take a final and informed decision on the matter by 23 January 2020, and it will immediately inform National Olympic Committees, National Federations and officials on any development”.*"

Current estimates for this new strain of coronavirus (nCoV) show at least 500 people in 7 countries have been infected of those there have been 17 confirmed deaths

If we look at the SARS  coronavirus and the 2003 epidemic, lasted about 6 months. it was reported that 8,100 people were infected in 29 countries of those 774 died. CDC rates SARS at a BSL-2

Another coronavirus, MERS started in 2012-2015, its reported 2,500 infected in 27 countries of those 858 died. CDC rated it at BSL-3

Ebola is a diff type of virus but to put in perspective, cdc rates it a BSL-4. Outbreaks are still happening in west Africa. But from 2014-2016 mainly west africa countries, but reported in at least 7 other countries reported 28,000 people infected and 11,000 deaths

Also lets review the black plague, in the 14th century was caused by bacteria from rats /fleas due to the un-hygenic and un-sanitary conditions of the time, the virus spread easily due to this.  roughly 50 million people died or 60% of Europe at the time.

Ao todo, são 444 casos confirmados de pessoas infectadas.

 Autoridades da China e de outros países intensificaram os esforços para controlar um surto. A China desestimulou reuniões públicas na província de Hubei, onde o vírus surgiu no mês passado, e intensificou medidas de contenção em hospitais.

 A Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) tem uma reunião de emergência agendada para determinar se o surto constitui uma emergência de saúde global.

 [O vírus se espalhou da cidade chinesa de Wuhan](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/estudo-sugere-que-governo-chines-restringe-dados-sobre-coronavirus.shtml), em Hubei, para Pequim, Xangai, Macau, Hong Kong e [também chegou a Estados Unidos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/01/eua-confirmam-primeiro-paciente-infectado-com-coronavirus-chines.shtml), Tailândia, Coreia do Sul, Japão e Taiwan.

 O governo chinês atualizou o número de casos em uma tentativa de conter o pânico, num momento em que centenas de milhões de pessoas se preparam para viajar pelo país e ao exterior para as celebrações do Ano-Novo Lunar a partir desta semana.

  ""O aumento da mobilidade do público aumentou objetivamente o risco de propagação da epidemia e a dificuldade de prevenção e controle"", disse o vice-ministro da Comissão Nacional de Saúde, Li Bin, a repórteres.

 Há evidências de que o vírus estava sendo espalhado através da ""transmissão respiratória"", disse Li. E o diretor-geral do Centro de Controle e Prevenção de Doenças da China, Gao Fu, declarou que o vírus está se adaptando e se modificando, ressaltando os desafios para as autoridades de saúde.

 Cerca de 2.200 pessoas que entraram em contato com pessoas infectadas são mantidas isoladas, enquanto 765 foram liberadas da observação.

 ""Houve uma grande mudança no número de casos, o que está relacionado ao nosso maior entendimento da doença, melhorando os métodos de diagnóstico e otimizando a distribuição de kits de diagnóstico"", disse Li.

 Os sintomas do vírus, que pode causar pneumonia, incluem febre, tosse e dificuldade em respirar.

 Não existe vacina para o vírus, que pode ser transmitido de pessoa para pessoa. Quinze profissionais médicos estão entre os infectados na China.

 Temores de uma pandemia semelhante ao surto da Sars (Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave), que começou na China e matou quase 800 pessoas em 2002-2003, agitaram os mercados globais, com as ações de empresas de aviação e artigos de luxo particularmente atingidas, e o iuan sofreu queda.

The most common ones have vaccines that are proven safe literally a billion times over, and the diseases are absolutely not benign when left unchecked. As we’ve seen with those measles outbreaks, people who don’t get vaccinated spread it among those close to them, and abroad when they travel. So yes, if they don’t have basic vaccines, they shouldn’t be going out. Hell, I know someone for whom measles is actually deadly due to a prior sensitivity. She relies on herd immunity for her safety. So it makes even less sense for someone to skip a totally safe vaccine to put someone like her at obvious risk.

Before vaccines a lot of people had certajn diseases. Many got sick. Many died. After vaccines a lot less people got sick. A lot less people died. In some instances the disease straight up got wiped off the map. That’s an easy, binary reason to support vaccines’ widespread use. Vaccine scares and drops in use only came about AFTER a falsified medical study linked them to autism and a rise in internet use and access to information, much of it manipulated or misunderstood, came about.

And no one is shaming those spreading the coronavirus, or at least I haven’t seen evidence of such things. Maybe in their native China, where a lot of the culture can be upside down and misinformed by the state-run media, or on equally upside down corners of the Internet. But the average person is just as scared as anyone about infectious diseases and wants people to be healthy and smart about what they do after they become infected."

Any significant population decrease can put a species back hundreds of years, so it’s a pretty bad scenario to begin with.

Further, an antibiotic-resistant bacteria is usually a persistent strain bacteria that has developed an immunity to antibiotics. So what makes them more dangerous is that they can travel further and more effectively the less they’re able to be treated."

They are very close indeed, and I barely distinguish them in my daily conversations. However, admittedly there are minor differences. The following is my humble opinion:

改进 usually refers to (sometimes significant) updates or adjustments in techniques or approaches. A sentence cited from a Chinese webpage of Apple Support can help: ""macOS 更新可以改进 Mac 的稳定性、性能和安全性"" (I prefer not to provide direct translations to practice your reading and prevent potential confusion in my word choice). Since the previous version of macOS is already good, Apple used 改进 to indicate its introduction of new functionalities in macOS. 改善 often refers to an act of ameliorating (sometimes strongly) negative or unsatisfactory situations. For instance, it can be used if the current coronavirus strain in China starts to become tolerable. 提高 is the most usual one among the three words and usually involves expectation attachments. For example, '提高成绩' was the most common phrase I heard from the parents of my friends and mine before Gakao!

## Interim Guidance for Preventing 2019 Novel Coronavirus(2019nCoV)

新加坡童心国际青岛第一幼儿园 *Yesterday*📷  
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.    
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.  
On 31 December 2019, the WHO China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology (unknown cause) detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January.  
On 10 January, WHO published a range of interim guidance for all countries on how they can prepare for this virus, including how to monitor for sick people, test samples, treat patients, control infection in health centres, maintain the right supplies, and communicate with the public about this new virus.  
Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.   
Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.  


### WHO advice

It is prudent to remind populations and health workers of the basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections by following the below mentioned measures:

* Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;
* Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;
* Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals;
* People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands);
* Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments. """

The incubation period for SARS is estimated to be 1 to 14 days with a median of 4 to 5 days. The incubation period for MERS is usually 5 or 6 days, but it can range from 2 to 14 days.

&nbsp;

>The median incubation period for secondary cases associated with limited human-to-human transmission is approximately 5 days (range 2-14 days). In MERS-CoV patients, the median time from illness onset to hospitalization is approximately 4 days. In critically ill patients, the median time from onset to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is approximately 5 days, and median time from onset to death is approximately 12 days.

&nbsp;

>In all, the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases in China increased to 541 and the death toll to 17.


As an educated guess at the usual median of other types of Coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV, the incubation period should be 3-7 days. Numbers must be lagging behind by a big amount. We also don't know how early those people who died were infected.

On a positive note, maybe the 2100-8600 unaccounted cases (according to the WHO) aren't going to the hospital, because it isn't severe enough. Fingers crossed...

**Why** is everyone falling prey to this fear propaganda? Firstly, viruses are *not* contagious, contrary to what you may believe and have been taught as science 'fact'. The reason that this virus exists in the Chinese population is because of the extreme pollution and poor air quality there. That is why their bodies have manufactured a virus strain to deal with it and cleanse the lungs and respiratory tract. 300 people have developed it, according to their numbers, with some deaths. In a population of billions, this is to be expected when such pollution is rampant and widespread. 

If a large population develops a virus, it is due to their circumstances, not because it is contagious. CDC is fearmongering once again and will continue to perpetuate the lie that this virus is spreading like wildfire. They did it with measles, and with swine flu, and they they will do it with this as well. Coronavirus is another fraudulent scam perpetrated on the people of the world to get them to once again step in line to get their vaccine shots and to be systematically poisoned once again.  Don't fall for it. The only way to get this virus outside of being in China and developing a respiratory illness is to get their vaccine, which will introduce it into your body via the blood.

440 are 440 people who were swabbed, tested and found to have coronavirus.  


Note most people ( even in rich European countries ) do not get swabbed .. it is often treated clinically. The people who get swabbed usually are people who has entered hospital or has worse than usual symptoms.   


So one rule of thumb I learnt back in medical school is for every confirmed case of ay infectious disease ... multiply by 5 for the actual number ( this is regardless of which country you find them in, as even in countries with advanced healthcare not everyone gets swabbed and tested ). This by the way is a rule of thumb only ... looking at things such as speed of spread etc.. changes the value .. sometimes by as much as X8 to X10."

> MOH said that all travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell.

> They should also inform their doctor of their travel history.

> Those who have fever or symptoms such as cough and runny nose should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of their visit.

> As of Wednesday, at least nine people outside of China were also confirmed to be infected with the disease.

> MOH had previously stepped up its precautionary measures to prevent transmission of the virus on Wednesday, following a confirmation by China's health commission on Monday that the coronavirus responsible for causing pneumonia in Wuhan can be transmitted between people.

> Those with pneumonia who have travelled to any part of China within two weeks of showing symptoms will be subjected to isolation measures. These symptoms include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties.

Ya son nueve las [víctimas mortales](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/11/actualidad/1578735649_012206.html) y el número de infectados sigue creciendo con cada hora del día: los últimos datos hablan de 440 enfermos. Por poner en perspectiva: el viernes eran solo 41, y la Comisión Municipal de Sanidad aseguraba que las pruebas médicas no arrojaban resultados positivos desde el pasado 3 de enero. La escalada de este nuevo coronavirus, descubierto hace dos semanas, recuerda a la del [SARS](//elpais.com/tag/sars/a), con el que guarda similitudes genéticas. La epidemia de 2002, también originada en China, [causó la muerte de 700 personas en todo el mundo](//elpais.com/diario/2003/05/11/sociedad/1052604001_850215.html).

 La mayor parte de las infecciones (270) se concentra en Wuhan, [epicentro del brote surgido en diciembre](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/09/actualidad/1578556344_366873.html). Desde esta ciudad, situada en la zona central del territorio chino y hogar de 11 millones de personas —más que Londres o Nueva York—, el patógeno ha comenzado a extenderse a las provincias vecinas. Si el pasado viernes no había ningún positivo fuera de allí, hoy son 38 los casos repartidos por otras 15 grandes urbes.

 Pero estos datos podrían no ser del todo fiables. Un modelo desarrollado por expertos del Centro de Epidemiología de Enfermedades Infecciosas de la Universidad de Hong Kong sugiere que la realidad es aún más preocupante de lo que revelan las cifras oficiales. Según su informe, elaborado en colaboración con la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y presentado este martes, el número total de infectados podría rozar ya los 1.500: 1.343 en Wuhan y 115 en el resto del país.

 El escepticismo es lógico tratándose de un país en el que no impera la libertad de información. Muchos recuerdan, además, el precedente del SARS, cuando las autoridades negaron la existencia del virus durante semanas. El Partido Comunista Chino ha hecho referencia a ese mismo episodio para advertir a las administraciones locales y regionales de que deben informar con exactitud sobre el curso de los hechos. “Todo aquel que no diga la verdad será clavado al pilar de la vergüenza para toda la eternidad”, proclamó este lunes *Chan An Jian*, perfil oficial en redes sociales de la Comisión Central de Asuntos Políticos y Jurídicos, brazo supervisor del Partido en materia legal. Esta sentencia se suma a la intervención de ayer del secretario general Xi Jinping, en la que llamaba a “tomarse en serio” la contención del brote.

 Existe otro motivo para la intranquilidad: las estimaciones del modelo de la Universidad de Hong Kong responden a un “escenario moderado”, en el que Wuhan permanece como el único foco del brote y no aparecen enfermos altamente contagiosos, conocidos como “superpropagadores”. Este último factor de riesgo, no obstante, podría ser ya una realidad.

 La OMS realizó ayer una visita a Wuhan junto a un grupo de expertos sanitarios chinos, liderados por el doctor Zhong Nanshan, director del Laboratorio Estatal de Enfermedades Infecciosas en Cantón y eminencia nacional en la materia. Sus hallazgos muestran que 15 empleados médicos en la ciudad habrían contraído el virus, lo que confirma la posibilidad del contagio entre humanos —un extremo descartado hasta este fin de semana—. 14 de ellos, además, habrían sido infectados por un solo paciente, según reveló ayer Nanshan en una entrevista con la televisión nacional, lo que abre la puerta a la existencia de estos “superpropagadores”. “La clave para controlar la expansión en este momento pasa por prevenir su aparición”, apuntó el investigador.

 Mientras tanto, [continúa también la expansión internacional](//elpais.com/sociedad/2020/01/16/actualidad/1579160356_375302.html). A los cuatro casos localizados hasta la fecha en Tailandia, Japón y Corea del Sur, se ha sumado este martes el primer positivo en Taiwán. Se trata de una mujer de 55 años que, como en los casos anteriores, también visitó Wuhan en las últimas semanas. “La paciente desarrolló los síntomas a partir del 11 de enero, pero no ingresó en un hospital”, ha informado esta tarde Huang Wang-ting, médico del Mando Central de Epidemias de Taiwán. El ministro de Sanidad de la isla, Chen Shih-chung, ha asegurado que ninguno de los familiares de la enferma presenta síntoma alguno, similares a los de una neumonía ordinaria, y que otras 46 personas que estuvieron en contacto con ella durante el trayecto de avión han sido puestas en observación. Asimismo, Filipinas y Australia también han anunciado haber tomado medidas ante los primeros casos sospechosos en su territorio nacional.

 La OMS ha comunicado que celebrará mañana miércoles una reunión de emergencia para decidir si declara “una emergencia de salud pública internacional” a causa del brote. El Consejo de Estado chino, por su parte, también ha programado una rueda de prensa en la que detallará la evolución del virus en las últimas horas."

> SINGAPORE — Three more suspected cases with pneumonia have been admitted for further assessment and treatment as well as isolated as a precautionary measure here, as the spread of a new coronavirus widens across China and other parts of the world.

> The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (22 January) that it was notified of these cases – a 3-year-old male Chinese national, a 4-year-old male Chinese national, and a 78-year-old female Singapore resident – as of 4pm.

> The trio – all of whom have travelled to mainland China – remain in stable condition.

> Previously, seven suspected cases in Singapore have been declared negative of the new coronavirus strain, which originated from the Chinese city of Wuhan.

> The virus belongs to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-2003 outbreak and also started in China.

> This comes hours after Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced on social media that he will be co-charing a multi-ministry taskforce, together with Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong, to deal with the new coronavirus here.

> “The Wuhan virus situation has escalated sharply in the last few days and is evolving very rapidly. The MOH is at the frontline dealing with this public health issue. But it requires a whole-of-government, even a whole-of-Singapore, response,” said Wong.

> On Wednesday, Chinese authorities announced that nine people had died from the coronavirus and 440 people across 13 Chinese provinces had been confirmed to be infected. They also warned that the still-unidentified virus could mutate and spread.

> Over the past week, 10 cases have been confirmed across other parts of the world, including US, Hong Kong, South Korean and Japan.

> In his Facebook post, Wong stressed that the government will “spare no effort to defend and protect Singapore and Singaporeans”, but noted that the most important defence is for the Republic to be “psychologically prepared”.

> “We must stay calm and carry on with our lives. We must be prepared that, despite our best defences, it is a matter of time before we see imported cases here and be ready to mount a swift and effective response,” said, as he called on for Singaporeans to be socially responsible.

> “If you show symptoms, don’t go out and certainly avoid crowded places. See the doctor immediately so you can be assessed early and get treatment. All of us need to continue to adopt good hygiene habits – wear a mask if you have a cold and must go out; wash our hands regularly, etc,” he added.

> The MOH also issued its first travel advisory in response to the situation on Wednesday, calling on travellers to avoid non-essential travel to Wuhan and for those who need to travel to affected areas to regularly check its website for updates.

> “Travellers to China are also advised] to stay vigilant, monitor developments and heed the advice of the local Chinese authorities while in China,” the ministry added.

> In the advisory, the MOH also reiterated its stepped up precautionary measures, previously announced in the past two days, that come into effect on Wednesday.

> Among them, Individuals with pneumonia and have travelled to China – not just Wuhan – within 14 days before the onset of symptoms will now be isolated in the hospital.

> Individuals with acute respiratory infection who had been to any hospital in China within 14 days before the onset of symptoms will also be isolated in the hospital. All travellers arriving from China will also have their temperatures screened.

> While there have been no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus reported in Singapore as of Wednesday, the ministry cautioned that more suspected cases, and possibly imported cases, are expected to emerge given the high volume of international travel to Singapore.

You don't want to breath that stuff.) We don't yet know how it's spread, but decent odds are, since it's a coronavirus, it spreads the same way the common cold does: aerosol droplets.

Eye protection may also be useful, as some viruses can infect you through mucous membranes like the eyes. 

What wearing a N95 mask \*also\* does is that it cuts down the risk that you'll catch a regular old cold or influenza. You really do not want to have \*any\* respiratory infection if this is in the area; at a minimum, you may end up being screened in a facility where people really have it (chance of catching it). Wore, there's a chance you could simply end up stuck in a quarantine facility because they don't have the ability to test for NCOV and anyone with a snotty nose is going to be quarantined, end of story."

The government holds all the power and leverage and they will only garner more sympathy if people are scared of the coronavirus more than the government. tl;dr the coronavirus is not a tactical advantage to protesters at all AND biological weapons are strictly immoral and prohibited by the UN so please don’t do this."

The act aims to respond to the increasing number of cases of disease due to coronavirus reported by the Chinese government.

The virus first appeared in the city of Wuhan, China, last December. Up to now, the total number of cases that have been confirmed exceeds 200 patients, including three deaths from this respiratory disease.

The Ministry of Health also requested an increase in preparedness of the health service authorities and hospitals in dealing with the possibility of the disease being transmitted to Indonesia.

Anung Sugihantono, Director General of Disease Prevention and Control at the Ministry of Health, said that body temperature scanners, or thermal scanners, at entry points for foreign migrants were being reactivated to detect symptoms of the virus. “Because one of the symptoms is high temperature, respiratory distress, the earliest one that can be detected is by using a thermal scan,” Anung said.

In response to this, Anung explained more attention would be given at airports that have direct flights from China. HeHe also stated that currently there are travel advisories related to travel to China, but this has not reached the level of travel warnings.

Anas Ma’ruf, Head of the Soekarno Hatta Port Health Office, confirmed that his party had implemented the recommendations from the Ministry of Health. He added that the entrances to Indonesia totalled 135, including 35 international airports.

“Our officers are also updated with information and trained, so there is preparedness,” said Anas. **Until now, Anas has not found people who were caught by temperature scanners that lead to diseases caused by the corona virus**."

(We are friends and [do lots of podcasts together](https://soundcloud.com/user-519115521).)  There are two separate issues with quarantining people who have contagious diseases: (1) is it the morally correct thing to do, and (2) is it effective in stopping the likely spread of the disease.  According to Greg the answer to (2) is a clear ""yes"".  Our political system has decided that the answer to (1) is often a clear ""no"" especially in the case of diseases that primarily afflict minorities such as AIDS and Ebola.  Consequently, to avoid having to face unpleasant tradeoffs, our political system has decided that the answer to (2) must now also be a clear ""no"".

What you're essentially saying is that unless people get vaccinated, then they shouldn't be allowed into public. Like they shouldn't goto the doctor when they're sick, because they could transmit their disease to someone else in the waiting room. Heck if we look at the recent ""coronavirus""  (when did they start naming them after bands of beer?), they are essentially shaming these people for spreading the virus worldwide.

There are a couple problems with this position:

There are a lot more diseases that don't have vaccines than ones that do. If it's wrong to go out in public without a vaccine, then what does that mean for these non-vaccine diseases? The current coronavirus is worse than spreading measles and polio, yet there is no vaccine for it. How do these people get a free pass to spread their germs, yet chickenpox qualifies for the full weight of social media. 

Now before you say ""well they are doing the best they can by at least getting the minimum"", there are some things that can be done. If someone knowingly feels sick (e.g. sore throat) and they cared about society, then it's quite easy to quarantine themselves. Quarantine is effective and I would say equal in effectiveness to vaccine (assuming it's followed religiously). 

So if there is an expectation that people should be ""doing something"" against disease, then this needs to apply to every infectious disease and not just the benign ones that have vaccines."

> China has said that 440 people have now contracted a mysterious Sars-like virus that has killed nine people, as the government unveiled measures to rein in the spread of the disease and advised residents of Wuhan not to leave the city.

> &quot;The virus may mutate, and there is a risk of further spread of the virus,&quot; said Li Bin, deputy director of the commission.

> Chinese authorities initially played Sars cases down, and were subsequently much criticised because the virus spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750.

North Korea is closing its borders to all foreign tourists from Wednesday as a precaution against the Wuhan coronavirus, according to Young Pioneer Tours, a travel agency that runs tours to the country.

Though North Korean citizens are, for the most part, closed off to the rest of the world, the country does operate a small tourist industry that caters mostly to Chinese tourists.

It's unclear exactly how many tourists visit the country each year. China's Global Times, a state-sanctioned tabloid, reported last year that about 100,000 people visited North Korea each year -- 80% of whom were Chinese."

The US CDC provides estimates of the disease burden of influenza at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html. Estimated mortality per 1000 illnesses between 2010-2011 and 2018-2019 ranged from approximately 1 to 1.7 deaths per 1000 illnesses.

If there are currently 6 deaths out of 258 confirmed cases in Wuhan due to 2019-nCoV (a rate of 23 deaths per 1000 confirmed cases, see https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-outbreak-china-6-1.5434256), the question is what would the death rate be with a denominator of illnesses rather than confirmed cases? One can see that it would take only 13 or 14 illnesses per confirmed case to make the 2019-nCoV death rate similar to the influenza death rate of 1.7 per 1000 illnesses.

Since it is reasonably possible that for every confirmed case of 2019-nCoV there are at least 10 undetected illnesses (a seroprevalence study would help answer this question), then one could speculate that 2019-nCoV is more similar in severity to influenza than it is to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Its transmissibility seems to lie between these 2 groups."

The incubation period for SARS is estimated to be 1 to 14 days with a median of 4 to 5 days. The incubation period for MERS is usually 5 or 6 days, but it can range from 2 to 14 days.

&nbsp;

>The median incubation period for secondary cases associated with limited human-to-human transmission is approximately 5 days (range 2-14 days). In MERS-CoV patients, the median time from illness onset to hospitalization is approximately 4 days. In critically ill patients, the median time from onset to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is approximately 5 days, and median time from onset to death is approximately 12 days.

>In all, the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases in China increased to 541 and the death toll to 17.


As an educated guess at the usual median of other types of Coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV, incubation period should be 3-7 days. Numbers must be lagging behind by a big amount.

Which is all to say, we have to wait and see death rate. 

Keep in mind the CDC says 6600 people have died of the flu this flu season.... Soo... Watch those numbers, compare it to known epidemics, and that's where you will figure out exactly how worried we should be in how dangerous this is."

You've probably had one at some point in your life. 

Some of them evolve to cross infect between animals and humans, and those tend to be more severe because it's harder for our immune systems to fight them off. The one that has everyone worried right now is the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or 2019n-CoV. It's worrisome especially because it's so new. 

The checks at the airports and stuff isn't just because of worries that it will spread, but because each new case is more data on *how* it spreads. Plus, each new blood sample is a fresh chance to crack the genetic structure. So don't be too alarmed by the checks at the airport and stuff, but still also be vigilant about hand washing and such and probably don't go the Wuhan Province of China right now.

I posted this in another thread, but think it's worth repeating, because it seems like the risk of contagion isn't too bad:

This paper published yesterday suggests it won't be too much of a problem:

> this new virus showed that its S protein only binds weakly to the ACE2 receptor on human cells whereas the human SARS coronavirus exhibits strongly affinity to the ACE receptor. These findings suggest that the new virus does not readily transmit between humans and should theoretically not able to cause very serious human infection.

Hell the ambulance service I worked for had a full Ebola isolation tent-bed thing with special protocols for patient care. Health services made special preparations for potential incoming Ebola cases and everyone was vigilant for any signs of haemorrhagic fever. This was all *invisible* to the general public because the majority of these preparations aren't visible and are about vigilance and screening, not widespread quarantine with guards at the border.

On top of that, as everyone else has already stated, there's a big difference between transmission of Ebola, and coronavirus that spread through airborne droplets. Coronavirus is much more infective and presents with fairly non-specific respiratory tract infection-style symptoms.

Minas Gerais announces suspected case of coronavirus in Belo Horizonte

According to the Ministry of Health, the Brazilian's case does not meet the risk criteria defined by WHO because she traveled to Shanghai, where there is still no record of contamination

.

RIO AND BRASÍLIA - A 35-year-old Brazilian woman who traveled to Shanghai , China , was hospitalized last Tuesday in Belo Horizonte with suspected coronavirus infection, which has already left 17 deaths in the Asian country. The information was released this afternoon by the State Health Department of Minas Gerais .



According to the agency, the patient arrived in the capital of Minas Gerais on the 18th of the month with respiratory symptoms that would be compatible with the mysterious pneumonia caused by the new strain of viruses in Asia . She reportedly informed doctors that she had not been to Wuhan , a Chinese megalopolis that is at the epicenter of the outbreak, nor had she contacted any suspicious people.

The Ministry of Health informed, through a note, that the case investigated in Minas Gerais ""does not fit the definition of a suspected case by the World Health Organization (WHO), considering that the patient was in Shanghai, where there is not, until the moment, active transmission of the virus "". This is because according to the current WHO definition, there is only active transmission of the virus in Whuan province.


Minas Gerais health authorities identified the case in an Emergency Care Unit (UPA) in Belo Horizonte, and the Brazilian woman was transferred to the Eduardo de Menezes Hospital, also in the capital. Her health status would be ""clinically stable"", according to a note from the Health Secretariat.


""The case was notified as a suspect. In view of the current epidemiological context of the country where the patient was, the hypothesis of a disease caused by the new coronavirus, which is an international health alert microorganism, was considered, considering the pandemic potential with a high risk to life. and assistance impact "", stated the government of Minas Gerais in an excerpt of the statement.



According to the Ministry of Health, the Brazilian government has been monitoring the situation daily with WHO. Measures were also taken in accordance with the organization's guidelines, such as ""the notification of the Ports, Airports and Borders area of ​​the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa); the notification of the Animal Surveillance area of ​​the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA) ), and the notification to the Health Departments of the States and Municipalities, other Secretariats of the Ministry of Health and other federal agencies based on official data, avoiding restrictive and disproportionate measures in relation to the risks to the health and transit of people, goods and goods "".

To reduce the overall risk of acute respiratory infections, the ministry reports that among the guidelines are: avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections; perform frequent hand washing, especially after direct contact with sick people or the environment; avoid close contact with wild animals and sick animals on farms or farms.

The ministry also informed that, as soon as there is a definition of emergency by the WHO, it will take the ""appropriate measures

The Minas Gerais Health Secretariat did not disclose the identity of the Brazilian or the municipality of her residence. The hospital complex is the same one that received the victims of the case of poisoning by diethylene glycol in Minas Gerais.

Ebola, while having a very high mortality rate, is only really communicable through direct contact with bodily fluids. This inhibits its ability to spread on a large scale and consequently limits how many deaths it can cause. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak infected about 28,500 people and killed about 11,000 over the course of two years. In just a couple of weeks some experts say the coronavirus may have already infected thousands. This combined with the fact that symptoms can be easily mistaken for the flu makes it much harder to contain. (How many people with flulike symptoms never even see a doctor?) That could lead to millions of infected people over the same time period, and possibly tens of millions if it starts wreaking havoc in places like India or Africa. 

From reported cases and deaths it seems like coronavirus has a mortality rate of around 1-2%. That doesn’t seem anywhere near as scary as Ebola’s 40-50%, but if it infects 1 million people the death toll will be the same. If it infects tens of millions then we could see death tolls in the hundreds of thousands. I’m not saying we should be panicking but simply looking at mortality rates isn’t the best way to judge the threat a new virus poses. (I mean lots of cancers have a mortality rate of like 5-10% and have way fewer cases, but look how they’re viewed.)"

Surgical masks are not designed or certified to prevent the inhalation of small airborne contaminants. These particles are not visible to the naked eye but may still be capable of causing infection. Surgical masks are not designed to seal tightly against the user's face. During inhalation, much of the potentially contaminated air can pass through gaps between the face and the surgical mask and not be pulled through the filter material of the mask. Their ability to filter small particles varies significantly based upon the type of material used to make the surgical mask, so they cannot be relied upon to protect workers against airborne infectious agents.

>just as you ignore the portion of the CDC website which says surgical masks and hand washing prevent transfer of coronavirus.

Please show me where it says that. I have searched this [link](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) about the novel coronavirus and could not find what you claim. I did however quote what I found previously. 

>These masks work both ways. It will protect a wearer from an infected just as much as it will prevent an infected wearer from spreading the disease

Surgical masks are not designed or certified to prevent the inhalation of small airborne contaminants. These particles are not visible to the naked eye but may still be capable of causing infection.........

How many times are you going to ignore this?

> It prevents bodily fluid from being projected through the air and into someone’s mouth/nose, which is how coronavirus is spread. Coronavirus doesn’t live in the air.

This might be effective if someone is coughing or sneezing directly in your face. But the aerosolization of infectious bodily fluids is hardly uniform and will come in different sizes.

Alberta has a rare rare-earth opportunity on its hands – if it chooses to seize it

Sara Hastings-Simon is a research fellow at the University of Calgary and a member of the board of Emissions Reductions Alberta.
It’s just a fact: An energy transition is definitively under way, spurring dramatic shifts in how the world produces and consumes energy. In Canada, that reality has been met by fears about existing jobs in the oil sands and the future of various resource-driven economies, as well as by debate and policy planning about lowering the carbon footprint of the existing oil and gas production and about what role it can or should play in an increasingly decarbonizing world.
Lost among all that, however, is one important question: How Canada can use its natural resources in new ways to meet the shifting demand?

STORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT

Forecasts, such as the recent Science paper “Sustainable minerals and metals for a low-carbon future“, show massively growing demand for the metals and minerals that will power the energy transition – such as rare earths in the magnets used to generate electricity in wind turbines, and lithium in the batteries that enable electric vehicles to move. Canada, with its vast natural resource base, has many of the raw materials required to contribute to the growing global demand. This represents a significant opportunity for Canada to carve out a major role in the continuing work to build a resilient, secure and sustainable global supply of these metals and minerals.
Historically, however, governments have not pumped significant investment into developing the technology necessary to extract these resources in a commercially viable way. But as demand grows the opportunity becomes more attractive. To date the economic case for resource development has been challenged by China’s control over a large percentage of the resources. The ability for one supplier to flood the market and depress prices threatens the business case for technology and resource development. Addressing the challenge begins with viewing these metals and minerals as a strategic resource, and putting our money into growing that industry by enabling the development of the necessary technology along with implementing the policies necessary to provide market certainty.

By mobilizing to meet the growing demand for metals and minerals of the energy transition in a sustainable way, Canada can prosper in a low-carbon future through export of Canadian metals and minerals and components made with these resources, along with the export of knowledge around potentially innovative extraction technologies. Moreover, with the development of robust certification protocols, Canada can become a supplier of choice for corporations who have made sustainable sourcing commitments in response to growing demand from both consumers and investors.

This will, of course, draw accusations that the Canadian government would effectively be “choosing a winner” by investing heavily in one industry over the other. However, the history of technology innovation demonstrates how significant direction and investment from governments is vital in enabling natural resource development. For example, government intervention was critical for both the development of the in-situ oil sands production technology in Alberta, as well as the development of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies in the U.S. that unlocked production from shale rock formations. It’s time once again for the federal and provincial governments to use public revenues generated in part from existing higher carbon industries to fund innovation and enable the large capital investment required to prove out new technologies, through an array of tried-and-tested policy and funding tools: direct investment, provision of low-cost capital, along with procurement policies and mandates.
This doesn’t mean that forward-thinking oil and gas companies can’t get involved, too. Globally, oil majors are spending revenue from their core businesses on acquisitions – such as smart grids, renewable energy, energy storage, electric vehicle charging infrastructure – that can enable a strategic shift and can position their organizations to remain competitive in a low-carbon future. Metals and minerals represent another opportunity to do the same, as approaches to developing those resources share many of the same core competencies, and many of them can be found in the same geographical areas in Canada.
We must proceed carefully; prioritizing sustainability across the environment, communities and biodiversity, while ensuring that public investment in innovation translates into public benefit, will require a delicate tightrope walk. Public ownership of natural resources can continue to help enable a straightforward method to capture benefits through royalties – even more so for natural resources than other technology in general.
Developing an industry around the metals and minerals of the energy transition is an opportunity for the federal government to support natural-resource economies across the country as global demands change. The unique skills and resources in the regions can enable an economic development opportunity that is consistent with Canada’s mid-century decarbonization targets. The provinces along with industries can work hand-in-hand by investing revenue from the existing higher carbon industries into the development of these new resources. In doing so, Canada can position itself as an international leader in powering and moving the world sustainably for many decades to come.

""Johns Hopkins, Gates Foundation announce pandemic recommendations

A joint effort from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation recently made seven key recommendation for pandemic preparedness, based on an exercise conducted in October 2019 that featured a fictional coronavirus—not unlike the new Wuhan coronavirus recently detected in China.
The pandemic exercise tracked how a major pandemic virus would elicit responses from global corporations, key health organizations, and industries. Based on the exercise, the partners wrote seven recommendations for public-private entities, according to a Johns Hopkins news release.
The recommendations include planning for essential corporate capabilities, ensuring that travel and trade routes are maintained during an outbreak, and realizing the financial burden outbreaks place on industries.
The partners also recommended that governments should provide ""more resources and support for the development and surge manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics that will be needed during a severe pandemic.""
According to the Center for Health Security, recent economic studies show that pandemics will cause an average annual economic loss of 0.7% of global gross domestic product—or $570 billion. """

The scary thing is that we don't know much about it other than it's caused 17 deaths out of about 500 confirmed cases and that it's spreading rapidly in China and has begun to be reported in other countries.

We still don't know much about how dangerous this disease is, but so far its mortality rate appears to be worse than the flu. The World Health Organization is currently deciding whether or not to declare a health emergency, and a few hours ago China announced that they would be shutting down transportation out of the city of origin, Wuhan (a city of 11 million people). This is why it is making headlines."

Wang is also known as a leader in the study of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and is treating in an isolated area and is in stable condition.

[Photo] An SARS virus, a type of coronavirus, was captured with an electron microscope.

According to reports from the Chinese media, Wang was a member of a group of experts dispatched by the China National Health and Health Commission to locals last December when pneumonia spread in Wuhan. It seems that he stayed there for at least eight days. He told a news agency, Xinhua News Agency on October 10, that ""prevention of any illness is important"" and emphasized the importance of wearing a mask and increasing immunity through exercise.

2020-01-22,woofwoofpack,China_Flu,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/esb3tj/updated_london_imperial_college_report_estimating/ff8tlgo/,"***Summary:*** We estimate that a total of 1,723 cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (95% CI: 427 – 4,471)
had onset of symptoms by 12th January 2020 (the last reported onset date of any case).
This estimate is based on the following assumptions:

• Wuhan International Airport has a catchment population of 19 million individuals [1].

• There is a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection, comprising a **5-6 day
incubation period** [8,9] and a 4-5 day delay from symptom onset to
detection/hospitalisation of a case (the cases detected in Thailand and Japan were
hospitalised 3 and 7 days after onset, respectively) [4,10].

• Total volume of international travel from Wuhan over the last two months has been
3,301 passengers per day. This estimate is derived from the 3,418 foreign
passengers per day in the top 20 country destinations based on 2018 IATA data [11],
and uses 2016 IATA data held by Imperial College to correct for the travel surge at
Chinese New Year present in the latter data (which has not happened yet this year)
and for travel to countries outside the top 20 destination list.

***Conclusions:*** **Our estimates of the size of the outbreak in Wuhan have more than doubled since our first
report**. This is a result of the number of cases detected outside mainland China having
increased from 3 to 7. Our analysis does not allow the growth rate of the epidemic to be
determined however. Our estimates should not be interpreted as implying the outbreak has
doubled in size in the period 12th January to 18th January – delays in confirming and
reporting exported cases and incomplete information about dates of symptom onset together
with the still very small numbers of exported cases mean we are unable to estimate the
epidemic growth rate at the current time.

**It is likely that the outbreak of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan has caused substantially more
cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than have currently been detected and
reported**. However, recent rapid increases in officially reported confirmed case numbers in
China suggest that case detection and reporting has been substantially enhanced in recent
days. With further refinements to case definitions and testing and further expansion of
surveillance (for instance, to primary care providers) it is to be hoped that the differences
between our estimates and official case numbers will lessen further.

This analysis does not directly address transmission routes, but recent reports [11,21,22]
and past experience with SARS and MERS-CoV outbreaks of similar scale suggests
currently self-sustaining human-to-human transmission should not be ruled out. Given this
evidence for human-to-human transmission, enhancing rapid case detection will be essential
if the outbreak is to be controlled."

Even though there 8 US cases they were quickly quarantined. By the time US infections occurred they were able to treat them. There doesn’t have to be fatalities for quarantined to occur. That is the point of quarantines.

As for H1N1 that was a problem in the US, China, and other parts of Asia it was sub-strain 9. Swine flu itself is a North American virus. 

Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, mutated and while still originating in North America it had genes from North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza, and two other swine influenza viruses typically found in Asia and Europe.


As you can imagine with H5N1 happening in China at the same time, Americans latched on to Avian Flu and were quick to blame China, even if it was North American Avian flu that this H1N1 stain mutated with.

The city has seen huge growth in flight traffic over the last years. Airlines had **332,861 seats** on offer from Wuhan Tianhe International airport this month, double the number available in Jan. 2010, according to Flightglobal aviation website.

Global links include **13** direct flights to **San Francisco** each month, **17** to **Dubai** and **14** to **New York City**. Wuhan also offers direct connections to European cities such as **Istanbul**, **London**, **Moscow**, **Paris**, and **Rome**.

As the Lunar New Year begins on Saturday, with millions of Chinese journeying homewards this week to celebrate with their families, the risk of spreading the virus has turned the spotlight on Wuhan’s role as a railway hub.

Its three railway stations run train services to key destinations such as **Beijing** and the southern city of **Guangzhou,** with high-speed connections among them.
