All good, but here is the [actual video](https://youtu.be/6dDD2tHWWnU) by CaryKH.


This video had many other comparisons than just this one, highly recommend it.


Here is the boiled down version of CaryKH’s conclusion, a **TLDR** of videos.

>Coronavirus is bad, and will get much worse than it is currently; however, at its current infectivity, location, and immunity, you are extremely unlikely to get Coronavirus. If anything, you are many times more likely to die of a stroke tomorrow than even contract Coronavirus.

**MY CONCLUSION** (after speaking with an M.D. who works in global health) is that Coronavirus will be terrible, much worse than the swine flu, and will kill many. But you probably won’t die. Coronavirus kills mostly elders or infants. (People who are vulnerable), but it is a respiratory disease which we have 0 immunity to, so it will almost for sure be a worldwide epidemic, and likely becoming a pandemic. 

*take my comment with a grain of salt, and I would suggest watching/reading other conclusions.*"

Anybody who believes Chinas numbers needs to rethink. Also, people who compare it to the normal flu need to understand that the ratio of infected to deaths is far higher with coronavirus. This is a scary outbreak."

Yes, the coronavirus has a higher fatal % the older you are, *however*, it has only kill ~2,000 people so far, not enough to even make a fucking dent on the aging population. Hell, it would barely does anything to the demographics even with 200,000 deaths in China. 

Secondly, around 20% of the cases are severe, and while most can make full recovery, the virus can have a lot of permanent, long lasting effects, for example lung fibrosis. Which means that more working people can actually be fucked in long term and become a burden to the economy than the virus can kill the older population. 

Lastly, would they stopped their entire economy for one months, which will cost them billions of dollars, just for a solution that *might* worked?

The problem with being a patient in the front of this disease is you get treated like an idiot by doctors.

No.  If you tell them you think it is Covid19, do you think they will laugh at you?  Yeah probably.

While I don't work in infectiology or the departments treating and researching Sars CoV 2 (it's been renamed), I can answer some questions, if you have any. Take everything with a grain of salt, as usual when getting advice from a ""non-expert-doctor"". 

To put it into easy terms: Sars CoV 2 is a completely new virus of the corona family, the genetically closest 2 viruses are MERS and SARS which were associated with very high mortality rates. SARS CoV 2 seems to have a more manageable mortality rate in comparison (roughly 0,3-1% estimated and 2.3 percent in China), but a medium-high rate of associated severe health-problems leading to hospitalization (pneumonia). There is no specific treatment yet, only supportive (i.v. fluids, invasiva ventilation if needed, etc), as with most virus diseases. And we only have the current cases as data, so it's something ""new"", not something that's basically known but hasn't been around for a while (like ebola).   
There is a good chance that healthy individuals carrying the virus (incubation period) are already infectious, but WHO doesn't see it as a likely driver yet (good thing). The cases who died so far are - as usual - the weak, the complex ill (i.e.many and more severe chronic diseases) and the elderly, the immunocompromised and smallish children (i.e. all those with less immonocompetence), but some cases of younger and healthy patients who died are also around. 

The problems I see with SARS CoV 2 are these: The virus is unknown until this outbreak, so we have no experience in dealing with it. Infection rate might be high, mortality rate is roughly 8 times that of the influenza strains common in central europe, but one must also consider that most deaths happen in Wuhan, where the healthcare facilites are under extreme stress at the moment. To put it frankly: There might be people dying because of lack of treatment capacity.   
Secondary issues: the virus could possibly mutate to something more problematic (always an issue with virus epidemics), plus it comes at the same time as this years flu epidemic which ALSO is binding a lot of capacity at hospitals, since this seems to be one of the harsher years. The current hysteria leads to more patients visiting their doctors / ERs thinking they might be infected. All of this this might lead to a multiple strain on oftentimes already short-staffed healthcare-systems, which in turn could prove problematic as seen in China. Imo this is the main reason for the higher mortality rate in china than the rest of the world atm - Wuhan is pretty much drowning in infected, they're running out of material and the healthcare professionals are getting worn out, which imo is also the reason why estimated mortality (0.3-1% and real case fatalty 2.3% are diverging - the added cases are pretty much those dying from a healthcare system far over capacity. We're VERY far from that situation in the rest of the world yet and our healthcare systems are pretty efficient.    
Areas of the world where things might get really ugly really fast: 3rd world countries with no access to a functioning healthcare system. If SARS CoV 2 spreads in central africa, things might turn very very ugly (locally). 

So: Is there reason to panic at the moment? Absolutely not, there is a very limited amount of cases, and nearly all of them have gone really well in Europe. Things seem quite under control, quarantine and information systems are working just fine and our friends from the pharma companies are already working on vaccines. Most people in europe will probably be more affected by once again not getting their flu vac this year, than the SARS CoV 2. 

european CDC as our go to site for anything ""new"" is doing a really good job and always worth visiting when you're looking for updated data. They're currently updating cases every day and giving a very good overview of current and probably scenarios.

After the 2015 Middle Eastern Flu epidemic in Korea, this project started in 2017, to battle the theoretical breakout of a new coronavirus coming from China. Researchers had just recently completed the project in 2019 when the real coronavirus epidemic hit China. The test kit can show the results up to within three hours, which allows South Korea to test up to ten thousand people a day. Compared to Japan which took weeks of agony for the 3000 quarantined and trapped cruise ship passengers to be tested.  If that had happened in South Korea, all the passengers would have been tested for the virus within max. 2 days, and they all would have been off the ship and went home the following day after the sick were weeded out. 

South Korea is able to provide the testing kit to replace the faulty US-made kits which made their way to 30 countries, except Japan which is aiming to increase its own antiquated testing kit's testing rate to 1000 people a day. They are hopelessly behind and yet refuse to admit it nor seek help due to extreme pride in their past glory days that's long gone."

Se guardiamo la mappa del Johns Hopkins vediamo che l'Italia riporta un numero di casi (62 ad ora) superiore UK + DE + FR + NL + ES sommati.

# Analisi del piffero Livello 1

Italia e Francia hanno più o meno la stessa popolazione (circa 60 mln), come mai FR riporta 16 casi, e IT il quadruplo? Per la legge dei grandi numeri e ridistribuzione, dato che viviamo in un mondo globalizzato, non dovrebbe essere all'incirca lo stesso numero?

# Analisi del piffero Livello 2

Lasciamo perdere l'Italia un momento e guardiamo DE, FR, UK, ES, NL e Belgio, rispettivamente con 16, 12, 9, 2, 0 e 1 contagi documentati (fonte Johns Hopkins).

Le rispettive popolazioni (dati wikipedia) sono 83, 67, 67, 46, 16 e 11 mln di 
persone. Proviamo a stimare molto spannometricamente il numero di contagi facendo una banale proporzione con i contagi e la popolazione di DE (che è la nazione più popolosa del campione): per FR verrebbero 12.9 contagi, per UK lo stesso 12.9, per ES 8.8, per NL 3, per Belgio 2.1. Tutti questi valori sovrastimano i valori effettivi riportati. E diciamo che siccome parliamo di singole persone, non di centinaia o migliaia, è giustificabile dall'errore statistico un delta nell'ordine di (diciamo) 2-3-4 persone (es. NL dovrebbe essere 3 ma riporta 0). E vedete allora che i valori veri tornano con i valori stimati, a parte casi sporadici (spagna per esempio ha un delta molto più grande, 8.8 - 2 = 6.2, è quello che in statistica si chiama 'outliar'). Diciamo che la congettura più o meno tiene. 

Tiene però fino a quando non facciamo rientrare l'Italia nella big picture. in IT siamo 60 mln e riportiamo 62 casi. La proporzione con DE (83 mln e 16 casi) è ovviamente del tutto sballata e chiamare anche questo caso 'outliar' sarebbe scientificamente disonesto. Secondo la congettura, in IT dovremmo all'incirca avere 11.5 casi, invece ne riportiamo 5.4 volte tanto.

Come mai questa sensibile differenza tra IT e il resto delle nazioni maggiori dell'Europa continentale, assumendo che per la legge dei grandi numeri dovrebbero avere all'incirca, errore statistico a parte, la stessa distribuzione in base alle rispettive popolazioni?

# Analisi del piffero Livello 3

Continuiamo a concentrarci solo sulle nazioni Europee in quanto la situazione socio-economico-politica di Shenghen e' rilevante a giustificare una distribuzione equa dei casi tra le nazioni maggiormente popolose. 

Come possiamo giustificare questo fattore di 4x (guardando IT e FR) e 5.4x (guardando IT e DE) che abbiamo precendentemente valutato?

I principali vettori di contagio del virus per Europa dovrebbero essere di 3 nature: l'economia (persone che viaggiano per lavoro tra EU e Asia), il turismo (che però assumiamo essere trascurabile in questo momento) e le persone che vanno a trovare i parenti in madrepatria e/o a festeggiare il capodanno Cinese. 

Partiamo dalla popolazione cinese in EU. Ovviamente ci sono tante popolazioni vettori asiatici, ma i cinesi sono il focolaio primario e sono anche la nazione di gran lunga più popolosa dell'Asia e del mondo, quindi direi che sono una buona approssimazione. 
Vi invito a guardare questo grafico, uno dei primi risultati Google che ho trovato. Anche se si tratta di dati del 2011, i dati del 2020 non dovrebbero essere troppo distanti. https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Chinese-migrants-in-the-EU-and-EFTA-countries-2011-Prepared-on-the-basis-of-20-23-27_fig2_328978373
Come si può notare IT, FR, DE, NL, ES hanno basilarmente la stessa distribuzione di popolazione cinese. Solo in UK si vede un valore doppio.
Questo ci fa concludere che il famoso fattore 4x o 5.4x di cui sopra NON può essere giustificato da una differente (maggiore) distribuzione di cinesi in italia rispetto agli altri stati europei, perchè di fatto i numeri sono gli stessi.

Next, economia. Uomini che viaggiano per lavoro. Affari, visitare fabbriche, etc. Sicuramente un vettore valido, soprattutto fabbriche che possono avere condizioni proibitive sul lato sanitario (e.g. scarpe, vestiti, cosmetici). Secondo voi, il famoso fattore 4x o 5.4x può essere giustificato dal fatto che l'Italia ha un giro di affari con fabbriche cinesi 4 o 5 volte superiore da Francia? O germania?
 
Purtroppo questo dato non è di facile reperimento quindi lasciamo il punto in sospeso sui fatti. Diciamo però che a naso direi che NO, l'italia è un'economia stagnata da parecchi anni e che trovo molto difficile che si possa dire che abbia un giro di affari con la cina neanche pari (figuriamoci 4 volte superiore) a UK, FR e DE, giganti del banking e della produzione tech/automotive.

Rimane il turismo, e più in generale il modo di viaggiare con la Cina.
Anche qui -- ahimè. I maggiori aeroporti di attracco dall'Asia in europa sono LHR, CDG, Francoforte, Amsterdam Schiphol, Madrid. Lo sanno tutti. Dall'italia quasi non esistono voli diretti transcontinentali, qualcosina da MXP e Fiumicino ma nulla di comparabile con Francoforte.

Ma allora perchè in Olanda ci sono 0 contagi e in italia 62 ? Gli 'untori' che sono arrivati in italia che diavolo hanno fatto di diverso in italia che non hanno fatto di transito a Schiphol? Non si sono seduti su panchine accanto ad altre persone? Non hanno viaggiato con olandesi sullo stesso aereo che li ha riportati in EU?

A questa persona, in post mortem, per scrupolo, è stato fatto un tampone che è risultato positivo. Per cui – ha specificato l’assessore – ad oggi non possiamo dire se è morta per coronavirus o per altro. È un dato di fatto».

A me sembra chiaro che questi 2 ultrasettantenni morti possono benissimo essere positivi al tampone perchè erano malati di polmonite o di patologie simili che colpiscono gli anziani di inverno. Qual è l'affidabilità del test per coronavirus usato dai coroner italiani? Siamo sicuri che non abbiamo tanti falsi positivi? Siamo anche sicuri che la narrativa delle news italiane non sia per lo più clickbait e distorcente la realtà?

Stasera il Tg1 ha dedicato 10 minuti al coronavirus, ai casi di Codogno e del lodigiano. Il TgLa7 tutta la mezz'ora. Anche i titoloni dei giornali maggiori online non scherzano.

Forse finalmente tra qualche giorno i numeri si sgonfieranno magicamente?

That includes herpes, varicella (chicken pox/shingles) and Epstein Barr virus (mononucleosis/glandular fever). COVID-19 is a coronavirus (which you definitely already knew), which is a different family also containing SARS and MERS. 

While latency is a known viral trait, it's not super common. And those who do become latent tend to be in families with other viruses that have latency. I'm not saying COVID-19 can't be latent, but I'm not aware of other coronaviruses showing latency. So I find it unlikely.

Also latency is a really long term thing - like months to years. In this case I'd think it's maybe more likely that the infection just wasn't fully controlled and came back, a bit like what can happen (with bacteria) if you don't finish a course of antibiotics."
2020-02-22,Mook1971,Coronavirus,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f81nfj/infections_increase_among_repatriated_cruise_ship/fii9hrc/,"Twenty-eight U.S. residents flown home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are infected with coronavirus, and health officials expect to see more positive cases among the evacuated passengers in coming days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
The passengers from the ship, along with three infected people previously returned from Wuhan, China, bring the total number of evacuees with the virus in the United States to 31. An additional 13 people in the United States either picked up the infection by traveling to China or from close contact with a family member who had been in China.
The passengers, who had been quarantined aboard the cruise ship in Japan, are “considered at high risk of infection and we do expect to see additional cases,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a media briefing.
AD
The sharp rise in the number of U.S. patients came on a day of grim news about the spread of covid-19, the viral respiratory disease that has afflicted more than 76,000 people and killed more than 2,300, mainly in China.
The number of cases in South Korea surged to 346, with more than half linked to a secretive religious movement with a messianic leader. Iran confirmed 18 cases, including four deaths, centered in Qom, a Shiite holy city south of Tehran. In Beijing, two hospitals were put under quarantine amid fears of a coronavirus outbreak in China’s capital, with one district reporting an “infection density” second only to Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic.
Messonnier said 18 of the Americans who were quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess in Yokohama harbor had positive results in CDC tests. Ten others were positive in tests conducted by the Japanese. The CDC won’t formally add those people to its count until U.S. tests confirm the findings, but Messonnier announced them Friday.
AD
The Japanese government quarantined 3,700 passengers and crew members aboard the Diamond Princess for nearly two weeks, a decision that allowed the virus to sweep through the ship, which one Japanese expert has said was plagued by poor infection control. Now, 634 of those onboard have tested positive — the second-
largest number in any place outside China.
Last weekend, the State Department flew 329 U.S. residents home from the ship on two chartered flights. The Washington Post reported Thursday that the evacuation was delayed for hours by a last-minute disagreement among government officials. As the passengers arrived at the airport in buses, test results came back indicating 14 people waiting to evacuate were infected with coronavirus.
CDC officials did not want to put sick people on the plane with uninfected passengers, but they were overruled by the State Department and another top government health official.
AD
At Friday’s briefing, Ian Brownlee, principal deputy assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, said the tests for those 14 people were conducted 48 to 72 hours before they boarded the buses, indicating they were infected on the ship.
A plane carrying 129 Canadians and their family members from the Diamond Princess also arrived in Canada on Friday.
It’s not clear where all the infected Americans are being treated. Eleven are receiving care at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Five are receiving care at hospitals around Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, where one plane landed, and two are being treated near Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, where the other flight arrived.
Dozens of other Americans from the cruise ship who tested positive were taken off the ship before the evacuation and are still in Japanese hospitals. They include Wayne and Susan Hidalgo of Kansas City, Kan., who wondered why the ship continued to allow people to mingle freely onboard, even after a passenger onboard was diagnosed with the virus. One of the people Wayne Hidalgo regularly dined with had shared a bus with the infected passenger.
AD
“As time went on, after a day or so, I wondered, why are we eating dinner with these people? Why is everybody out dancing? Why are they having these shows going on?” the 77-year-old said in a telephone interview from his hospital bed in Tokyo.
Japan’s Health Ministry said 88 Americans aboard the ship have been diagnosed with covid-19. Most have been taken to hospitals on land.
The Hidalgos’ children want them brought home, arguing that it’s “not fair” they’ve been left in Japan while other Americans were evacuated. Wayne Hidalgo said he knows the couple can’t leave until they are given the all-clear by Japanese doctors. They each need two consecutive negative tests.
Wayne Hidalgo said he is suffering from mild pneumonia and has been put on oxygen, but had only a fleeting fever. He’s taking antibiotics, but doctors haven’t felt it necessary to put him on anti-viral medication given to the most severely ill patients. Susan Hidalgo has no symptoms.

Wayne Hidalgo said he has become “more and more confident” with the medical care he is receiving as time goes by, and is “totally impressed” with his hospital, his doctor — who speaks fluent English — and nurses who are “wonderful and funny.”
“Susan, my wife, and I have both accepted the fact that we’ve got to stay mentally healthy, and exercise some, and stay here,” he said.
An official from the U.S. Embassy has visited, bringing them clothes and local currency, while Princess Cruises, the cruise line that operates the ship, has been in contact every day.
On Feb. 1, a Diamond Princess passenger from Hong Kong, who had left the ship Jan. 25, was diagnosed with the virus. Princess Cruises said it learned about this on social media the next day and reached out to Hong Kong authorities. On Feb. 3, the captain told passengers the ship would wait in Yokohama while Japanese Health Ministry officials assessed the situation. But passengers still mingled, including at a buffet dinner on Feb. 4. It was only later they were told to stay in their cabins.
AD
John Haering, 63, from Tooele, Utah, said he came down with a fever that reached 103.6 degrees on Feb. 10, but was not seen by a doctor until 5 p.m. the following day. For 2 ½ days, his wife, Melanie, put wet cloths on his forehead to keep him cool, replacing them every 20 minutes.
He wasn’t evacuated from the ship to a Tokyo hospital until Feb. 13. His fever had subsided by then. He has been in isolation ever since, with very little human contact. He takes his own temperature, and meals are passed through a stainless-steel cabinet with doors on two sides. Once a day, a nurse in full protective gear comes in to clean his room.
He said he has received just one phone call from the U.S. Embassy and no contact with Carnival Corp., the British-American company based in Doral, Fla., that owns Princess Cruises.
AD
“I have, as my doctor described it, bad pneumonia. I’m fighting each day to stay positive and healthy,” he said. “I don’t need the uncertainty of what will happen to me weighing on my thoughts.”
In a statement, the U.S. State Department said “the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad” is one of its highest priorities, including providing “all appropriate consular assistance” to U.S. citizens remaining in Japan, and visiting those who have been hospitalized from the Diamond Princess.
But Haering said he needs much more information.
“I’m worried and scared and frustrated with what I have seen and NOT heard so far,” he said in a statement.

Among the tasks: daily calls, emails, texts.
By Amy Harmon and Farah Stockman
Feb. 22, 2020
Updated 11:13 a.m. ET

After a long journey at sea on the Westerdam cruise ship, which was denied entry at ports across Asia over fears of the coronavirus, Holley Rauen finally returned home to Florida on Wednesday night. Moments later, she discovered that she had joined a cast of thousands who are being meticulously tracked by local health officials across the United States.

As Ms. Rauen’s plane from overseas touched down, one message was already waiting on her phone, from a nurse at the local public health department in her Florida county. Should she develop a fever or cough over the next 14 days, she should report it immediately, the nurse explained when Ms. Rauen called back.

“I was so impressed,” said Ms. Rauen, who is herself a retired public health nurse from the same health department in Lee County. “We are really truly in uncharted waters.”

Preventing the spread of infectious disease is the essence of public health work, but the scale of efforts by state and local health departments across the country to contain the virus known as COVID-19, experts said, has rarely been seen. Since early February, thousands of people returning to the United States from mainland China, the center of the outbreak, have been asked to isolate themselves at home for 14 days.
Local health officials check in daily by email, phone or text. They arrange tests for people who come down with symptoms, and in some cases, groceries and isolated housing. There is no centralized tally in the United States of people being monitored or asked to remain in isolation, and they are scattered across the nation’s nearly 3,000 local health jurisdictions.

People arriving from mainland China are added each day, while those who have completed 14-day “self-quarantine” periods are released from oversight. In California alone, the department of public health has been monitoring more than 6,700 returning travelers from China, while health officials in Washington State have tracked about 800, and officials in Illinois more than 200.

The nationwide mobilization is taking a financial toll, health officials say. The cost to local health departments is unknown, but some experts say it has reached into the tens of millions. Even as the first of 34 confirmed coronavirus patients in the United States have recovered in recent days, health officials say they are preparing for what some fear could still be a much wider outbreak. Worldwide, the virus, which is known to be highly contagious, has infected 75,000 people and killed more than 2,000.


All hands on deck are being pulled into this,’’ said Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a nonprofit organization that represents public health agencies across the country. “If it really blows up, at some point, it could overwhelm state and local health departments.”

So far, officials say, the containment effort in this country has been largely orderly. The only known transmission of the virus in the United States has involved people in the same household. But no matter how effective health workers are in monitoring their charges, “there will always be some leakage,’’ said Dr. John Wiesman, the Secretary of Health in Washington State.
In Washington, where the first coronavirus patient in the United States was confirmed on Jan. 21, health officials tracked down and monitored 69 individuals with whom the man had come in contact, including work colleagues, health workers and other patients present in a clinic he visited when he first felt sick. Still, there have been issues. One person the man had been in contact with and who had developed symptoms of illness flew on a plane to Wisconsin during the 14-day period when she was supposed to be isolated at home.


There is no way, with something this large, that you can make it seal-proof,’’ said Dr. Wiesman, who has started twice-weekly conference calls with the chief health officers in every state and territory to share tips and seek advice on how to manage the shifting challenges of the coronavirus response. While enforcing total compliance with isolation orders may not be possible, Dr. Wiesman said, “We have to try for 80 to 85 percent, and hopefully that will work.’’

Federal authorities are in charge of setting guidelines to manage the danger, such as deciding how much risk a returning traveler poses and who should be tested for the coronavirus. But the day-to-day work putting those policies in place and tracking thousands of people falls to the vast, decentralized network of local health departments across the country. Travelers’ data, culled from federal customs officials, is passed on to state health agencies, who farm out lists of people returning from China to local health departments.

In the Chicago area, public health officials are using an electronic monitoring system originally developed to track the measles to monitor more than 200 travelers. Each day, they receive a link asking their temperature and symptoms.

The costs associated with containing the virus have reached more than $150,000 a week for the Chicago public health department alone, according to its commissioner, Dr. Allison Arwady. Among the costs: $17,000 for a quarantine facility at an undisclosed location for people who can’t isolate themselves at home. So far, fewer than five people have used it, she said.

“If you are quarantining them under a legal order, you have to think about food, their medications, their communication needs and their mental health,” she said.
Some jurisdictions have negotiated with hotels to host people who may harbor the virus. Washington State has RV’s.

Ruth Jones, public health commissioner in Quincy, Mass., a town of about 100,000 people south of Boston, says that her department has been receiving lists of between three and 10 people each day who are returning from China and are being asked to stay isolated from other people. Quincy’s two public health nurses and two translators have been working long hours to call them and make sure they understand how to monitor and report any symptoms.

“It’s overtime for our nurses,’’ Ms. Jones said. “It’s been extremely busy,”

Local officials in places that have had confirmed cases have been under particular strain. In Madison and Dane County, Wis., a local health staff of 160 has been forced to rearrange its operation to focus on monitoring anyone who may have been exposed to a resident who tested positive for the virus after falling ill and remains in self-isolation.

“We’re in this new normal, but it’s not normal,” said Janel Heinrich, the county’s director of public health. Along with monitoring individuals who are seen as at risk of having been exposed to the virus, state and local health officials have been scrambling to prepare for worst case scenarios in the months ahead.  State officials in Washington said they will hold a webinar next week to brief school superintendents on best practices for cleaning and planning for home schooling should schools need to shut down.

“People are doing contingency planning,’’ said Julie Sullivan-Springhetti, spokeswoman for the Multnomah County Health Department in Oregon, which has devoted resources to preparing a regional hospital system for a potential case. “Just like we plan for the Cascadia earthquake, which may or may not happen in our lifetime.”
As for the returning passengers from the Westerdam, the cruise ship, passengers at first thought they had no reason to worry about the coronavirus because no one on the ship had traveled through mainland China during the outbreak. But after passengers began leaving the ship to head home, an 83-year-old woman was reported to have tested positive on a layover in Malaysia, creating confusion and chaos.

Erin Carney, 70, a retired nurse and midwife from Mendocino County, Calif., flew out on the same flight as the woman who was reported to have tested positive, though questions have been raised about that finding and the C.D.C. has since said that other passengers do not need to isolate themselves.

Given the initial reports of a positive test, Ms. Carney called hospitals to figure out what she and her partner should do.

“The person that we spoke to read the C.D.C. guidelines and thought that everything seemed fine and we didn’t have to self-quarantine,” Ms. Carney said. “They said, ‘If you have symptoms, go see your doctor.’”

But then a nurse from the Mendocino County Health and Human Services Department called Ms. Carney. She recommended that they quarantine themselves at home, and offered to supply groceries.

“We had kind of talked about doing that anyway,” Ms. Carney said. “They’ve called every day since.”

I'll address a few points:

1. The vast majority of people would not require hospitalization let alone ICU if things continue to present the way they currently are. I don't know how you can say with any certainty what ""chance"" people have, either. That 20% is straight out of thin air.

2. Again, if it's on your mask it's on your clothes and any exposed skin. So if you go into the restroom and fomites or aerosolyzed fecal matter that contain our coronavirus are in the air the mask probably isn't going to be enough, alone, to help you even assuming everything goes right with the mask. Personally, I would just avoid public restrooms altogether; and this isn't some hardship if this virus is as dangerous as it appears to be.

3. The masks are, again, not meant to be worn for long periods of time. They become *hazardous* and actually worse than no mask at all  after a certain point. Example scenario: you wear a mask and are unknowingly exposed. You wear the mask for a few more hours of being out and about. Moisture develops on the mask after hours of use, or a mist in the air, or rain, or spit, or splashes. The pathogens on the outside of the mask can now find their way inside and you don't know it. You're holding the pathogen against your mouth through what has become a wet rag.

4. I didn't say not to prepare though you're treating my comment as if I did. Instead, I gave him practical advice: limit your exposure, train hygiene habits. And if he really wants to take it seriously he can buy something more hardy than paper masks like cartridge respirators.

All in all this is a poor comment. This is exactly the kind of thing that has people panicking when they need not. It's filled with information that you clearly do not actually understand in context. You did him a huge disservice with this. Your ill considered, factually incorrect, information is dangerous. Please stop."

The rest of the people who don't have pneumonia are being asked to go to the GP where they will be treated based on their symptoms. As we know, the coronavirus begins with mild symptoms and gradually escalates. If the symptoms are bad enough, the GP will call an ambulance to bring them to a hospital for further checkups. 

Contact tracing is only a reactive measure and can only start when someone with pneumonia tested positively for Covid, and that is where most of the cases are found.  The number of cases coming from the same clusters reflects that. 

My belief is that we are honestly missing out on a lot of cases right now, especially when the virus is spread by aerosols and they didn't really trace the people that got onto public transport with the infected patients. It's just a matter of time when more cases will show up."

In other words, I feel this was a planned effort, and not actually event-driven. Sure, there's the Novel Coronavirus fear, but that timing is way off for such a massive move. That, and official numbers continue to drop.

I don't get bored at all. I am not social and don't like to eat in a restaurant (I do like takeout though), go to the movies or socialize... I spend like 15-16 hours online.... Reading reddit.... Coronavirus, China Flu and other subreddits... when I finish reading the hot posts i read all the ""rising"" and ""new"" ones.... I also read other forums... there is so much information online... an endless information to read.... I don't need to read books... I don't like to read books... I don't need board games or to find things to not get bored... the INTERNET is more than enough... I actually very hardly clean my place.. the internet consumes so much of my day that I find it nearly impossible to do anything else... I actually don't want to leave my house because then I will be missing on the net!  The only things I would leave my house for is groceries and takeout but takeout I do it really fast, go in, pick it up, so I can rush back home...

Then I also work and do work related things and surf the internet while working... I also shop online and research new things to buy (not a good idea perhaps at the moment).... I am actually baffled that people get bored staying at home... I am a hermit and that's what I do naturally.

I don't drink... and don't have sex either and don't need those things to offset so called ""boredom"" as other people have mentioned. How can someone get bored with so many things to read, new posts on IG etc... Reddit has so much interesting info I can easily spend 10 hrs reading about various things...

I can't fathom why someone would want to play a board game (I live by myself btw so I wouldn't play a game with anyone to begin with) or need puzzles or crosswords or books when there is the internet.

I find this question a bit bizarre... What do people do ""outside the house"" that is so exciting that they would get ""bored"" with online access. To me something like going to the beach would be boring but then I would be wondering about what I'm missing out online and surfing on a smart phone is not the same.

Working in a public environment and office is actually hell on earth which is why I work for myself from home. To me that is not a good thing but mental torture. Watching a movie in public is not enjoyable because there's people all around you and you can't lay down, fart freely, eat whatever you want without overpaying etc...  What are people doing that is so amazing outside the house that they get bored?

Every time I leave the house or am forced to socialize I can't wait till I get home because I'm so bored IN PUBLIC having to deal with people's bullshit. It all seems a waste of time.

I also like writing long posts like this which is also another way to keep busy...

I actually find myself spending so much time online that I don't even have time to watch Netflix or any movies at all, so I cancelled all my online movie subscriptions except for Viki.

Good snacks and food are very important to me. If I have olive oil or truffle chips, brie, various deserts like gelato, green tea mochi ice cream etc.... I don't get bored at all... many times when I leave the house it's because I am craving a certain food or snack....  and after i get it i go home right away."

Saying that the flu kills more people is not an argument with substance.  Of course the flu kills more people, its in every corner of the world.  The telling statistic is the mortality rate, which is the statistic that you seem to not want to focus on.

This is a new strain of coronavirus, which I'm sure you know.  China has never quarantined an entire city for a coronavirus in the past.  This was the largest quarantine in human history.  If this coronavirus is actually harmless, tell us why.  You're on a conspiracy forum; we all have very open minds.

È un [decreto-legge](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decreto-legge), quindi entra in vigore non appena viene pubblicato sulla Gazzetta Ufficiale (salvo che il decreto stesso non stabilisca altrimenti). Articolo 77 della Costituzione: «Il Governo non può, senza delegazione delle Camere, emanare decreti che abbiano valore di legge ordinaria. Quando, in casi straordinari di necessità e d’urgenza, il Governo adotta, sotto la sua responsabilità, provvedimenti provvisori con forza di legge, deve il giorno stesso presentarli per la conversione alle Camere che, anche se sciolte, sono appositamente convocate e si riuniscono entro cinque giorni. I decreti perdono efficacia sin dall’inizio, se non sono convertiti in legge entro sessanta giorni dalla loro pubblicazione. Le Camere possono tuttavia regolare con legge i rapporti giuridici sorti sulla base dei decreti non convertiti»."

2020-02-22,SeamusMcTodd,China_Flu,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f7wr1q/stop_lying_to_yourself_about_the_coronavirus/figdti5/,"This week, Apple Inc. became one of the first major corporations to issue a warning to investors about the negative impact of the coronavirus, demonstrating again the sort of transparency and responsiveness that has made it one of the most admired companies in the world. Meanwhile, the fact that so few other companies have followed Apple’s lead highlights one of the biggest challenges facing corporations today: telling the truth.

When I say companies have a hard time telling the truth, I don’t mean they are lying to their customers, to regulators or to investors; I mean they are lying to themselves.

While it is still too early just how big an impact the coronavirus will have on either the global economy or individual companies, it is already clear that it will not be negligible. Supply chains are already being disrupted. Consumer activity in China is already slowing. And Apple is not the only company that is going to feel the impact.

“It’s consequential,” Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, told USA Today Thursday, adding that shipping delays and shortages are now inevitable. “We’re standing on quicksand.”

But too many companies are still taking a wait-and-see attitude to the coronavirus.

Maybe this will all blow over by March, a lot of CEOs are telling themselves right now. Let’s not overreact. Let’s not get everybody worried for nothing.

That’s to be expected, of course, because it’s human nature. It is easier to take refuge in comforting lies than it is to embrace hard truths. But leadership – real leadership, effective leadership – is about doing just that, because confronting challenges is the only way to overcome them.

Supply-chain expert Yossi Sheffi – author of The Resilient Enterprise and The Power of Resilience – is urging business leaders to take coronavirus threat seriously.

“(T)he coronavirus could cause supply-chain disruptions that are unlike anything we have seen in the past 70 years,” he wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. “For now, the best course of action for companies is to analyze possible outcomes in the context of known supply-chain risks based on historical precedents, and to take precautionary measures that minimize exposure to future disruptions.”

Sheffi makes five specific recommendations:

1. Set up a central emergency management center. At this point it can be virtual but should include a clear roster of participants with clear decision-making rules in case of a pandemic.

2. Review the company’s product portfolio and the customer base in order to set priorities. If capacity is reduced, there will need to be rules for which products should be built and which customers should be supplied first.

3. Review suppliers. Who makes critical parts? Are there alternate sources? What is the suppliers’ inventory status?

4. Plan for operating to maximize cash flow rather than profits.

5. Maintain communications with federal and local authorities, as well as Chinese and other Southeast Asian friends and colleagues on the ground.

While this advice is aimed specifically at manufacturers, any company that relies on goods from China or which sells its goods or services in China can take similar steps to mitigate the risks posed by this potential pandemic.  But, again, you have to be honest with yourself to do this. You cannot consider only best-case scenarios. 

Another thing you can do is use Red Team Thinking to make sure that your strategies and plans are resilient enough to weather this storm. One of the best tools for doing that is “Alternative Futures Analysis,” which looks at the different ways in which a plan could unfold based on different external variables.

This is a powerful technique that I describe in detail in my book Red Teaming, but you can do a quick and dirty Alternative Futures Analysis by drawing two columns on a whiteboard. In the left-hand column, describe how your strategy or plan would unfold in a world in which the coronavirus threat is contained and business continues as usual. In the right-hand column, describe how your strategy or plan would unfold in a world in which the number of new cases continues to grow exponentially and there is significant disruption to global supply-chains and serious consequences for the macroeconomy.

This is something every business should be thinking about, because even if your business has no direct ties to China, more and more economists are warning that the impact of the coronavirus could be significant enough to push several economies – including the United States’ – into a recession.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told USA Today that while the coronavirus will only deal “a modest hit to the (U.S.) economy” if it is contained soon, the ongoing trade war with China, Boeing’s woes and other factors already mean “we’re teetering on the edge of falling off the rails.”"

And also ""WHO may be hesitant to declare a pandemic, as the label comes with significant political and economic consequences. When WHO last declared a pandemic for the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009, the decision was later criticized by some countries, who felt the decision incited unnecessary fear and overly aggressive responses. The declaration, for example, prompted many countries to spend large sums on vaccines, even though the H1N1 strain of influenza proved to be relatively mild."""

Charges resulting from a disease  outbreak in a country or location for which the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 3 Travel Warning if a)  the warning has been in effect  within the 6 months immediately prior to **your** date of arrival, or b) within 10 days following the date the warning is issued **you** have failed to depart the country or location.

That's slightly less than 9% of the country (USA) getting the flu this season. Only 1% of those infected ended up in the hospital. Only 6% of the folks who ended up in the hospital died.

If the current forecasts and the China Report is to be believed, 60% of the country will be exposed to the coronavirus this year. 30% of the country will actually will get infected, or 98 million. Twenty percent of those, or around 20 million people will end up in the hospital. Around five million will end up in critical condition. Around 2%, or 2 million, will end up dying.

1) The 1918-1920 pandemic flu had a CFR of about 2% as well.  WHO Situation Report 30 has the data for COVID and it's similar, maybe not quite as high, but also far more infectious so more people will get it if it's not controlled soon.

2) Countermeasures were taken during the 1918 flu... surgical masks were new and in wide use, quarantines were made.  Also, the political pressure to avoid countermeasures until it's too late is the same today as then because human nature hasn't changed.  

3) Just because COVID-19 kills more slowly than the 1918 flu does not make it less dangerous. In fact it makes it more dangerous, because countermeasures taken only after the first confirmed case are too late; the virus has several generations of hidden early-stage cases by the time a case becomes serious enough to get noticed. Witness Korea, Iran, Italy for examples. Or the Singapore meeting event.

4) COVID is killing plenty of people under age 50. The fact that it is less deadly for teens and 20-somethings than the 1918 influenza is good for younger people, but cold comfort to the 40-and-over who are taking the brunt of the death rate so far.

5) The early stage of the Spanish Flu did not kill in great numbers, in spring 2018. It mutated and got worse. The new coronavirus may do the same. 

It is prudent to take precautions in the face of a novel and largely unknown risk."

Going off current US statistics 0.05 percent of people who the flu die of it. Where as 2.5 percent die of coronavirus, but heres the thing the coronavirus statistics aren't even correct. If you look at the numbers:  78773 confirmed, 2462 dead and 23188 recovered (these are CCP numbers are certainly fake), then you can see that you have a 3.12% mortality rate sure not much worse but still a tad, but what isnt factored in is the fact that many many of the confirmed cases haven't even ran their full course of the virus. To get an actually understanding of the real mortality rate it is much more accurate to look at the recovered cases compared to the number of dead. This number ends up being 10.61%. 

The virus has a much higher R0 value (how many people are expected to become infected from a single infected person) at between 2.5 and 8.08 at the highest ive seen but commonly believed to be at around 4.0 now, compared with the flu at between 1.4 and 1.6. The incubation period is also sitting at around 14 days with some reports showing people after 20-40 days of quarantine starting to show symptoms. Speaking of symptoms the symptoms are much worse than that of the common cold including reports of major respiratory damage after recovering from the virus. The virus is still very much in its infancy are 'relatively concentrated' to certain countries but you will start to see over the next few months just how much this is ramping up. To stay ignorant and say 'its just the flu bro' is simply that. I could write another 5 paragraphs about this but most of this I have listed or would list Im not going to spend 10 hours getting the source for.

(one Coronavirus patient, can potentially infect the whole hospital) Also that's the reason Wuhan is still problematic. So if people are not ready... and medical personal is not instructed, normal hospitals would become death traps, very fast.

Your ""likely's"" and ""should's"" - need to be checked. This is not similar to Influenza in any respect and the comparison should end with ""fever and upper respiratory symptoms"". Mischaracterizing this as something resembling a ""new seasonal sickness"" or ""the next SARS"" is intellectually dishonest, and shares no basis in fact or reality.

As you said, there is no need to panic. That said, there is a need for more than the blase handwaiving in your comment. This is a real, and serious threat. Minimizing this is a disservice to yourself. Dont panic, get informed. If containment cannot prevent the spread of COVID-19 until an effective treatment can be identified and manufactured to a global supply level, *and* until a vaccine can be engineered, tested and *then also* produced in global quantities, everything going on in China is buying time and reducing the rate of spread. 

The odds of containment are very low which means we're not looking at ""other endemic coronaviruses"", we're looking at a *very* rapidly growing, *very* infectious pandemic, which we are still in the early steps of engineering a solution to. Dont panic, because it does no good, but start making sure you've got healthy habits.

As it stands, with no further clinical developments, this virus will have a ~1-2% mortality rate in developed nations. But with over 20% of patients needing ICU care, as this grows even the best hospital systems in the world will be overrun with the need. Less developed nations will likely see much higher mortality rates, if their capacity is limited. With a whopping 10% of closed cases ending in death, and just today, a previously ""recovered"" patient, testing positive again, we face a very real threat with COVID-19, and its not the flu. Please, get that comparison out of your lexicon.

No need for panic, but when you're wearing rose colored glasses, all the red flags, are just flags.

By ""more faith in ourselves"", do you mean more faith into others and a central government to equally distribute things, as in communism, that has resulted in such paradises as Cuba, the USSR, and Maoist China?

Or do you mean more faith into humanity's ability to work together to stop the widely-accepted impending threat of climate change, that has thankfully not resulted in every country simply signing treaties and doing nothing, or everyone else doing mostly ""feel good"" activities that contribute nothing to stopping climate change and otherwise doing nothing at all?

Or do you mean more faith in humanity to not eat random animals, cut live (illegal) meat without sanitation, and sell containminated meat on the floor of a dirty road, that has prevented an ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus across the globe? *(Don't believe me?

How many religious? Zero, except maybe arguably one - then it's  (academically-accepted) to only be partially responsible.

*(You say to crack open a history book, but have you ever opened a Chinese history book, that wasn't a sensationalized book written for the general public? Given your comment, I doubt it. Too bad it's almost never taught outside of China, or taught accurately. Even in China it's being distorted now. Then again, given what you wrote, I doubt even non-Chinese history is being taught properly now)*

**Your blind optimism and ""religion responsible for everything bad"" is itself, ironically, a religion.** And it's not a very good one either. Humanity is f\*cked, religion or no religion.

Also there’s a few posters who post a lot who won’t admit they have a negative “doomer” slant who post articles with extremely sensationalized titles - no attempt to present the information in a neutral outlook. Lots of bad links to sketchy sites/shady YouTube vids, suddenly more links to posts on other subs (?) that are even sketchier. There’s A LOT of shitposting comments and even more “fuck China/who/ccp/we’re all doomed/so it begins” etc.  
  
Between all those it’s become hard to get the actual good information. I directly follow some people who give good info but otherwise I think the sub transition realllly DIDNT help. Not to mention they kept collapse linked in sidebar as being related when IMO it should be taken off...  
  
Anyway that’s my hot take.......if this sub is less panicked now I do not wanna even imagine what it was a few weeks ago lol"

>

>OP don't listen to these people, if you don't feel comfortable with the risk factors involved then you can always pull out.

Stock market could surge or decline for any reason in the short term and will appreciate long term. I'm not saying it will or won't surge or dip. I'm just asking what's the plan if it does surge? Or even if it doesn't surge and dip. When do you know when to go back in? How do you know it's the bottom?

Some possible reasons for a surge could be:

- Feds continuing to lower interest rates & printing money which are funneled into the stock market

- Trade deal progress with China or any other nations.

- people realizing that coronavirus threat, while serious, is a temporary thing 

These are just some broad examples.

Generally speaking, the market is efficient. The general threat and it's negative effect on the market has been priced in. If it's worse or duration is longer than general expectation, it might cause a bigger dip sometime in the future or if it's mostly resolved quicker then expected, it could rally the market. But the general threat is priced in at this point.

Time in the market is more important than timing the market, because each day you stay on the sidelines, you are missing out on positive expected return over the long haul."

1. [Seemingly variable incubation period](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/man-infected-with-coronavirus-but-did-not-show-symptoms-until-27-days-later-says)

For some patients, the incubation period seems to be around 2 weeks but could it be possible that longer incubation would stem from a two-stage infection?

1. Intestinal infection from eating something infected, followed after some time by
2. Respiratory tract infection from self-exposure 

Based on this hypothesis, could the following measures be useful? Do they make sense?

1. **Would a chloroquine phosphate prophylaxis help kill the virus in its intestinal infectious stage?** It was [shown effective with patients](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/17/c_138792545.htm) who have the [full blown infection](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/coronavirus-covid-19-choroquine-data/)
2. **Self-quarantine in trying extra hard to not secondary infect yourself**: wash really well after going to the bathroom, no toothbrush in the bathroom, only flush after closing the lid...

Could frequent and proper hand hygiene also help a patient who has an intestinal infection, with or without symptoms, help protect that person from pulmonary infection, and the risk of pneumonia?"

There are few problems with coronavirus to be called just another flue.

First, there is no vaccine, so if you get sick and you have a weak immune system you are dead. If you are above 50 years old , you might die.  It is a strong virus , and you will need to a good immune system. 

I am guessing younger people should go through it like they would with other flue.

Second, it is unknown how long it takes before you can recognize any symptoms of having the virus. Normally, any flue should be spotted by the sick person within a day or two, which means, you will stay home and try to get better.

With coronavirus, apparently some people have had it for a month before getting sick. Which means, during that month, they could infect hundreds of people. And the viscious  domino effect takes place.

Be prepared to meet your deductible or if you're one of what... ~30 million people... be prepared to pay for your visit out of pocket. 

This will cause people to wait in order to be sure which is more time they can spread, and allows the pneumonia component to set in further. There is *at least speculation* (though its possibly confirmed?) that this virus can actually permanently damage your lungs if you wait too long for treatment.

Not only this, but the profit motive being what it is many rural hospitals are closing up doors. Hospitals that remain often run on the knife's edge with barely enough provisions/staff to manage usual business. *Some* have buffer, but many don't. What happens if this goes full China?

IF YOU ARE SHOWING SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS CALL YOUR DOCTOR. DO NOT TRAVEL TO THE DOCTOR OR THE ER. STAY HOME, PICK UP THE PHONE, AND WARN THEM YOU ARE SYMPTOMATIC AND WANT TO COME IN. DO NOT GO WITHOUT WARNING THEM BECAUSE YOU WILL SPREAD THE DAMN DISEASE TO EVERYONE YOU COME NEAR.

This may fall on deaf ears, but, the virus is not a big deal. Yes, it's novel (hey its nickname is novel coronavirus) and that makes it scary, but the media is making this exponentially worse than it actually is. The CCP reaction really did not help either (hey a new virus, jail everyone who mentions it!):

* Flu, which killed between 34,000 and 61,000 people in the United States in the 2018-2019 season, does not freak us out at all. Why? We're used to it despite a propensity for killing people. [Source.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6824a3.htm?s_cid=mm6824a3_w)
* The mortality rate is around 3% for COVID-19.
* The mortality rate is **low** for the health systems and conditions it appears in at the moment.
* Coronavirus isn't this virus. [Coronavirus is an umbrella name](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html) for a broad type of common virus. COVID-19 is this strain. SARS and MERS are other coronavirus strains you may have heard of.
* It spreads because it doesn't show symptoms for upwards of 2 weeks. It also looks like everything from the common cold to bad flu.
* Wash your damn hands. Then use a hand sanitizer. Both are more effective than one or the other.
* If you have a cough, wear a mask to protect other people and change it frequently. Wearing a soiled mask is about as effective as sending thoughts and prayers.
* It started spreading because people did not know what it was or what was making them sick, it was a high travel season, and because China has a shit ton of people in close proximity.
* It continues to spread because people panic, people don't know what to do, and frankly, we in the US at least have an aversion to letting sick people stay home and recover.

However, I get it though, it's nuts for no one that has lived through other pandemics. In my mind, the AIDS epidemic of the 80s, Ebola, Polio, and though I was definitely not around for Spanish Flu in 1918-1919 I'll toss that in there, are way worse.

Costa Mesa, California, filed a legal action after it learned federal officials planned to use its Fairview Development Center to house and quarantine several patients who tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.

The city said it was given little notice, and without input, about the plan.

""We have received no information regarding how the facility will be prepared, what precautions will be taken to protect those in the facility as well as those who live nearby, and other important planning measures,"" Costa Mesa Mayor Katrina Foley said in a statement.

Judge Josephine Staton, according to the city, issued the temporary restraining order late Friday night. An expedited hearing is expected to be held Monday afternoon.

Foley said the planned quarantine facility is adjacent to several residential neighborhoods and she and the Costa Mesa City Council were concerned about the safety of residents.

""Our top priority is the safety and security of this community and those who live in this region,"" she said.

The city filed the injunction largely because it says it was excluded from the process and hopes to have a dialogue with state, federal and local agencies going forward. ""A full and complete explanation of all plans is required,"" the city said in a statement.

""Our staff and council have worked nonstop to piece together information, and we voted unanimously in an emergency meeting to file a request for a legal injunction to halt this plan,"" Arlis Reynolds, a Costa Mesa council member, said in a statement Friday.

In the U.S., there are 14 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to the CDC. There are 21 people, 18 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was docked in Japan, who tested positive for the virus and were repatriated to the U.S.

Globally, there are reportedly more than 75,000 cases of the coronavirus, which has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization, with over 2,300 related deaths."

The US is wholly dependent on China for many prescriptions drugs including those shown to be effective in treating this disease. China has thousands of drug manufacturers, mostly small factories scattered across the nation. While China accounts for 70% of the market, the rest of the drug companies rely on them for raw materials for their own production.

Does your drug contain acetominophen? China is the world's supplier. Do you take Vitamin C? China produces 90% of it. Tetracycline? 90%.

In the early 2000s, China's government subsidized drug production, undercutting American manufacturers. So these big US corporations simply laid off workers and shifted production to the East.

Johnson & Johnson cut close to 13k jobs, Pfizer laid off 2k researchers. GlaxoSmithKline has more than 2000 employees in China. All the big names are tied to China -- Roche, Novartis, Merck, Eli Lily and many more. So even if a big American drug company produces your meds, chances are good disruptions in the supply chain are going to cause problems.

Millions of Americans could experience significant delays in getting their prescription drugs.

And it's not just meds. China manufactures a number a drug related products like spray bottles or pumps. And some of the drugs aren't going to be manufactured elsewhere because China has exclusive manufacturing agreements for drugs for anesthesia, cancer and HIV/AIDS.

Those that can be made elsewhere require Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (known as APIs). Even if you gear up factories in India, you still need the raw materials from China.

What makes you think all of reddit is white? And what exactly will this accomplish. Foreigners aren't going to help with India's problems, they'll just laugh and spout racist bullshit. What good will it do?

>white person who is racist and paints all Indians with the same brush isn't going to change his opinion if you'll only talk about good stuff in India in front of him.

This behavior makes others also turn racist. It creates new racists. I never said talk only good stuff but randians speak ONLY BAD STUFF 24/7. Only good stuff is bad, only bad stuff is also bad.

He claimed to have tested positive for coronavirus. That’s entirely possible because the coronavirus is a family of viruses and there are hundreds. The common cold is often a coronavirus. He absolutely did not test positive for COVID-19. If he did, the CDC would have quarantined his ass. 

I’m more angry about the racism. Would it be acceptable to say, “Gay people moved into my neighborhood, so I’m afraid of getting AIDS?”

AI being used to fight coronavirus

The World Health Organization cautioned years ago that a mysterious “disease X” could spark an international contagion. The new coronavirus, with its ability to quickly morph from mild to deadly, is emerging as a contender.

From recent reports about the stealthy ways the so-called Covid-19 virus spreads and maims, a picture is emerging of an enigmatic pathogen whose effects are mainly mild, but which occasionally -- and unpredictably -- turns deadly in the second week. In less than three months, it’s infected about 77,000 people, mostly in China, and killed more than 2,200.

“Whether it will be contained or not, this outbreak is rapidly becoming the first true pandemic challenge that fits the disease X category,” Marion Koopmans, head of viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, and a member of the WHO’s emergency committee, wrote Wednesday.

The disease has now spread to more than two dozen countries and territories. Some of those infected caught the virus in their local community and have no known link to China, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

“We are not seeing community spread here in the United States yet, but it’s very possible -- even likely -- that it may eventually happen,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Friday.

Unlike SARS, its viral cousin, the Covid-19 virus replicates at high concentrations in the nose and throat akin to the common cold, and appears capable of spreading from those who show no, or mild, symptoms. That makes it impossible to control using the fever-checking measures that helped stop SARS 17 years ago.

Spreading Surreptitiously
A cluster of cases within a family living in the Chinese city of Anyang is presumed to have begun when a 20-year-old woman carried the virus from Wuhan, the outbreak’s epicenter, on Jan. 10 and spread it while experiencing no illness, researchers said Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Five relatives subsequently developed fever and respiratory symptoms. Covid-19 is less deadly than SARS, which had a case fatality rate of 9.5%, but appears more contagious. Both viruses attack the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, via which they can potentially spread.

While more than 80% of patients are reported to have a mild version of the disease and will recover, about one in seven develops pneumonia, difficulty breathing and other severe symptoms. About 5% of patients have critical illness, including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure.

“Unlike SARS, Covid-19 infection has a broader spectrum of severity ranging from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic to severe illness that requires mechanical ventilation,” doctors in Singapore said in a paper in the same medical journal Thursday. “Clinical progression of the illness appears similar to SARS: patients developed pneumonia around the end of the first week to the beginning of the second week of illness.”

Unpredictable Illness
Older adults, especially those with chronic conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, have been found to have a higher risk of severe illness. Still, “the experience to date in Singapore is that patients without significant co-morbid conditions can also develop severe illness,” they said.

Li Wenliang, the 34-year-old ophthalmologist who was one of the first to warn about the coronavirus in Wuhan, died earlier this month after receiving antibodies, antivirals, antibiotics, oxygen and having his blood pumped through an artificial lung.

Wuhan Central Hospital said on Weibo that Li Wenliang is still under emergency treatment. GT reporters heard people weeping inside ICU. Li was one of the 8 whistleblowers who tried to warn other medics of the #coronavirus outbreak in Dec but were reprimanded by Wuhan police.

The doctor, who was in good health prior to his infection, appeared to have a relatively mild case until his lungs became inflamed, leading to the man’s death two days later, said Linfa Wang, who heads the emerging infectious disease program at Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School.

A similar pattern of inflammation noted among Covid-19 patients was observed in those who succumbed to the 1918 “Spanish flu” pandemic, said Gregory A. Poland, the Mary Lowell Leary emeritus professor of medicine, infectious diseases, and molecular pharmacology and experimental therapeutics at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

“Whenever, you have an infection, you have a battle going on,” Poland said in a phone interview Thursday. “And that battle is a battle between the damage that the virus is doing, and the damage the body can do when it tries to fight it off.”

Mild Symptoms
Doctors studying a 50-year-old man who died in China last month found Covid-19 gave him mild chills and dry cough at the start, enabling him to continue working. But on his ninth day of illness, he was hospitalized with fatigue and shortness of breath, and treated with a barrage of germ-fighting and immune system-modulating treatments.


He died five days later with lung damage reminiscent of SARS and MERS, another coronavirus-related outbreak, doctors at the Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital in Beijing said in a Feb. 16 study in the Lancet medical journal. Blood tests showed an over-activation of a type of infection-fighting cell that accounted for part of the “severe immune injury” he sustained, the authors said.

Controversially, he had been given 80 milligrams twice daily of methylprednisolone, an immune-suppressing corticosteroid drug that’s in common use in China for severe cases, though has been linked to “prolonged viral shedding” in earlier studies of MERS, SARS and influenza, according to the WHO.

The patient’s doctors recommended corticosteroids be considered alongside ventilator support for severely ill patients to prevent a deadly complication known as acute respiratory distress syndrome.

He was given at least double what would typically be recommended for patients with the syndrome and other respiratory indications, said Reed Siemieniuk, a general internist and a health research methodologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. Based on what was observed with MERS, the drug may delay viral clearance in Covid-19 patients, he said.

“Corticosteroids could cause more harm than good because of that risk,” Siemieniuk said in an interview. “I wouldn’t want to let a patient die without trying steroids, but I would wait until patients were extremely ill.”

China is just leading the pack when it comes to the disastrous effect of the Coronavirus.

It's dangerously complacent to assume that the effects of the Coronavirus everywhere else will be any less than those of China.

This is what has been so bizarre. These big headlines of human-to-human transmission ""outside china"" first death ""outside china.""

WTF do people think a virus that has transmitted between humans and kill people inside China will do ""outside China""?

Its the same virus, so ofcourse its going to have the same effect WHEREVER it spreads.

Peak China : yes

Peak everywhere else as well though.

What happens in China will happen to the rest of the world over the course of the next few months."

As a person who have friends and relatives in Van, if the disease spreads in Iran, it is literally impossible that it did not contaminate Turkey. The city is first destination of Iranian refugees and tourists.

I do not want to create panic or speculation but, I contacted a friend in Van and he said he heard from a doctor working in the hospital that the case was certain. I know, it is too speculative but I feel like I should tell.

Turkish government were really loose on the precautions. I am not sure if they can test potential victims. If I can make a wild guess, I would say there must be some people who have already caught the virus and got over or died from it. I believe this was the case with Iran. They did not see the outbreak until the deaths were visible.

To be honest, I do not know how such a contagious disease could be held off forever, but the window of opportunity China provided, as much as I condemn their government, should have been used more widely.

You can surely get the regular coronavirus again (by that i mean different non life threatening strains of virus that cause respiratory tract infections -- presenting as a common cold). The new strain of Coronavirus family (the wuhan coronavirus) is probably not a whole family of viruses, but rather one genetically pretty similar strain. 

So when youre infected and your immune system fight the infection, it will develop proper immune response to it. When youre infected second time, the antibodies your body made will kill the infection if i simplify the process (its similar to the goal of vaccination). Altough, the virus boi can be a trickster. It can change its outer capsular proteins and sugars therefore making it impossible or hard for the immune system to recognize (antibodies to bind to this changed molecules -- thats the reason of the influenza virus yearly outbreaks ). I assume that coronavirus isnt one of the hypermutating ones, but would really need to look into more detail for it, so no, you cant get the disease once again. Or even if you do, I would say that it has milder progression -- your immune system has already fought a virus (almost) like that and is therefore more efficient (thats the reason that even if you get the influenza vaccine and get the flu, it usually isnt as severe as it would be without vaccination). 

Hope this clears it up a little."

Not a bioweapon, more likely they were working on understanding Coronavirus in general.  The release came before the Chinese new year. When people are wanting to get home on time they get sloppy in their haste to leave. My guess is someone was exposed at the lab by accident, they didn't know or knew and thought it would be ok.

My other theory is this... They were experimenting on bats at the lab. End of the year, they go to dispose of some bats.. Janitor Joe comes along and says to himself. Hmmm maybe I can make a quick buck at the wet market with these bats.   That would explain the wet market angle.

Or genetics just mixed in a random crazy way at the market and whammo

Either way, it's out and we need to work together to survive this thing."

It is a serious issue but the world doesn't stop because of such a thing, and expecting that KPop stars should do it anyway is demanding something that is unreasonable. 

I mean, I agree they should take precautions, such as when BTS cancelled their public corporate briefing and only invited the press, and had other measures in place like air curtains and extra sanistising stations etc. Same with cancelling Chinese concerts or events in areas with known outbreaks of the illness.

I don't trust the Chinese CDC science when they put this in an academic paper.  Coronaviruses are ~30kb viruses and extremely unstable, needing error checking ExoNs to prevent high mutation rates.  When a study testing this protein in SARS-CoV was performed in mice, by 'knock-out' of the protein, the virus quickly became less infectious/inert.

'In the US, there are now [six confirmed cases](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/first-us-transmission-coronavirus-chicago). An additional 110 people are under observation, according to Messonnier. The “great majority” are travelers from Wuhan or people who had close contact with them. “The general risk to the [US] public is low at this time,” she stressed.'

'Over the weekend, a number of estimates emerged, ranging from 1.3 to 3.8. Harvard health economist Eric Feigl-Ding called the 3.8 value “thermonuclear pandemic level bad” '

'Even the high number isn’t so terrifying, Messonnier said. “As a comparison, the R0 for measles is between 12 and 18,” she said. '

'For [people in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/prevention.html), CDC suggests washing your hands frequently; not putting your fingers in your mouth, eyes, or nose; and avoiding sick people — standard advice during flu season. '

'Masks would not be necessary for anyone in the US, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Tuesday.'

'[Others have suggested](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0127-coronavirus-update.html) imports from China could carry a risk of transmission overseas. But coronavirus particles die within a few hours outside a host cell, according to Messonnier.'"

Symptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From
First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States 

35 year old male

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....

Given the patient’s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

On admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.


On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.

Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.


A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.


On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. 

As of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.

Now, don’t go hugging kissing and cozying up with this loved one, but that’s just because whatever they’re sick with, you don’t want either way! But quarantining yourself from this loved one, wearing masks and gloves around them, that’s just unnecessary. 

Do your prep, be ready for the worst, hope for the best, all that is fine. But in terms of this one family member, taking drastic steps is an overreaction and is the fear talking"

1) Chinese economy completely stalls - China no longer interested in buying U.S. debt. Manufacturing way down. Massive supply chain problems in the U.S.

2) U.S. economy takes a major hit. Debt sale fails. Companies start laying off rapidly.

3) Virus spreads rapidly through Western world, despite our advanced medicine. Hospitals overwhelmed. U.S. cities on lockdown, further damaging the economy. Access to basic necessities starts to become difficult. (In this scenario - Amazon with their distribution network may actually boom).

4) Supply chain issues and distribution problems start a cycle of inflation. Far fewer Americans working thanks to virus and everything costs more. Potential for a hyperinflationary scenario, especially since the U.S. is now having trouble selling debt, so they just start printing money WITHOUT debt.

5) Bank runs and general failure of banking systems.

6) Several hot wars break out. Certain countries recognize that the U.S. is unlikely to send soldiers into infected areas, so they know they have time to establish a foothold. North Korea invades South Korea to ""protect from the spread of the virus.""

7) Near election time, Bernie starts talking about the ""virtues"" of central planning in a situation like this. Talks about nationalizing farms to get food to hungry people. Talks about how ""greedy bankers"" caused banking issues. Promises immediate relief from bills people can't pay because their jobs are lost.

8) Bernie wins and starts nationalizing stuff almost immediately to help cope with the emergency. Ability of patriots to organize and protest is limited due to virus and local governments declaring a ""state of emergency"" because of the virus.

9) Gun confiscations begin as part of crackdown on crime associated with supply chain issues.

10) Welcome to the Union of Socialist States of America."

We are committed to serving all of your needs for personal protective equipment and safety, both now and in the future.

We want to assure you that we have enough inventory of affected products to meet existing customer demand at this time and that our top priority is to maintain stock for your industrial safety needs.

There are still many unknowns, and the longer the outbreak continues, the more upheaval there may be. We await further information from the CDC and the World Health Organization on the most recent data and predictions.

Chinese factories are said to be reopening in the coming days, but for now we are implementing new rules to ensure that your needs continue to be met for affected items including*:

Respirators and masks of all types

Disposable gloves

Coveralls

Goggles

Disposable protective clothing

*Please note that new items may be added to this list as the situation develops.

For new customers -- we will not fill orders on these items.

For existing customers who regularly rely on us for these products -- we can fill orders based on your consistent usage over the last 6 months. We will be unable to fill orders for quantities above this usage.

As a leader in personal protective equipment, we are increasing production and purchases to meet the additional demand as quickly as possible. We continue to closely monitor conditions and will keep you updated as more is known.

Olympia woman tests positive for coronavirus after cruise

Marianne Obenchain, who lives in Olympia, has tested positive for coronavirus or COVID-19. She was tested by Japanese health officials Saturday, when the U.S. government evacuated American citizens off the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

She and more than 100 other Americans were taken to Travis Air Force Base in California. Then her results came back positive and now Obenchain is in a hospital in California.

Obenchain said she was surprised to get the results.

“That news almost floored me,” she said. “I wasn’t showing any symptoms.”

She’s still showing no signs of the virus and is being retested by hospital staff here in the U.S. She laughed and joked over FaceTime and said she is glad to be back on U.S. soil.

“The positive thing is, I’m getting Starbucks. I’m like woohoo Starbucks!” Obenchain said.

She said she feels fine and doctors aren’t sure if she will develop any symptoms.

“They’re going to keep testing until I test clear,” Obenchain said. “It’s a terrible thing to say oh, you’ve got the virus. But you know – being here in isolation at Queen of the Valley Hospital is probably the best thing that could’ve happened,” she said.

As for Obenchain, she’s keeping her spirits up.

“I’m looking at it like an adventure,” she said.

But there’s no denying, going home to Olympia – whenever that might be – is sounding pretty good.

“Oh, it was sounding good about oh, 16 days ago,” she said with a laugh. “I miss work, I miss being able to walk around on my days off and go grocery shopping!” she said.

It’s not clear when she’ll be allowed to return home. The earliest would be 14 days after the coronavirus tests start coming back negative.

Costa Mesa, California, filed a legal action after it learned federal officials planned to use its Fairview Development Center to house and quarantine several patients who tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.

The city said it was given little notice, and without input, about the plan.

""We have received no information regarding how the facility will be prepared, what precautions will be taken to protect those in the facility as well as those who live nearby, and other important planning measures,"" Costa Mesa Mayor Katrina Foley said in a statement.

Judge Josephine Staton, according to the city, issued the temporary restraining order late Friday night. An expedited hearing is expected to be held Monday afternoon.

Foley said the planned quarantine facility is adjacent to several residential neighborhoods and she and the Costa Mesa City Council were concerned about the safety of residents.

""Our top priority is the safety and security of this community and those who live in this region,"" she said.

The city filed the injunction largely because it says it was excluded from the process and hopes to have a dialogue with state, federal and local agencies going forward. ""A full and complete explanation of all plans is required,"" the city said in a statement.

""Our staff and council have worked nonstop to piece together information, and we voted unanimously in an emergency meeting to file a request for a legal injunction to halt this plan,"" Arlis Reynolds, a Costa Mesa council member, said in a statement Friday.

In the U.S., there are 14 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to the CDC. There are 21 people, 18 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was docked in Japan, who tested positive for the virus and were repatriated to the U.S.

Globally, there are reportedly more than 75,000 cases of the coronavirus, which has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization, with over 2,300 related deaths."

The good news is that while it is deadly and spreading, it's not as widespread as the flu. (29 million flu patients have been reported, 280,000 hospitalized and 16000 dead)

This is partially because of quarantine efforts in affected countries, where the coronavirus has been limited to a smaller subset of the population.

That said, more people known to be infected die. About 78,000 Covid19 cases are known around the world, with 2,361 dead (as of the time of this post), bringing the mortality rate up to 2.3%, and because we do not yet know the incubation period and it seems people can be reinfected, those numbers could rise.

So, it should be treated with the utmost caution by individuals in injected areas, with quarantine and ample medical precaution taken for doctors and healthy persons, but if you are not in one of these critical areas, you don't need to freak out.

Just watch the news, and make sure no one pops up in your area."

Honestly, I think I agree with that approach. If you're in a highly populated area the risk from panic is way higher than the virus itself. Containment is not happening at this point, it's all about buying time."

I'm in Ireland and we had about 50 cases. We so far have none of the coronavirus. 
I definitely believe social media has helped to bring this current virus into the publics mind frame much faster. 
We have people in China posting images of what is going on now, we didn't have that in 2009.
Governments and news agencies basically can't hide any information because we can just come here and check.
But that is where the danger lies. Conspiracy theories and spreading fear is also a very dangerous side of having all this information. 
A man in India recently killed himself because he thought he had the coronavirus and he would spread it through his village (he  actually didn't and even so, having this virus is not a reason to end your own life)

Yes, he's implying that any country that has over 100 cases is considered an ""epidemic"" without regard to the size of the population.

He's also saying that the ""pandemic"" is ""accelerating"", which is a crock of shit because it's not been classified as a pandemic (yet).

February 20, 2020

Blair Zong, 33, lives in San Jose, Calif., and works at a start-up company. She was visiting her mother and grandparents in Wuhan, China, where she grew up, when the coronavirus outbreak became an epidemic.

She is among hundreds of Americans who were evacuated on flights arranged by the United States government and are waiting through mandatory 14-day quarantines on military bases.

She agreed to keep a daily journal of her time in quarantine. Here is some of her diary, edited for length and clarity.

Day 1

I was told that the last U.S. evacuation flight was going to leave tonight, so I reluctantly went to the Wuhan airport.

The whole terminal was in chaos. No one could figure out where to go. We got details about the U.S. flight on a group chat on our phones. My boarding pass was handwritten.

Day 1

The U.S. Embassy staff checked my body temperature, and gave me a green wristband. The color represented which flight I would take. One other U.S. flight was going out, too, and people were given yellow wristbands for that.

They wrote my temperature on the wristband, and tracked my status during the entire trip.

We had waited for five hours to be boarded. There were babies and kids, yelling and crying. I felt exhausted.

Day 2

When we got off the airplane at a military base in San Diego, workers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stood by in navy blue jackets with huge C.D.C. logos.

Everything looked like the movie “Contagion.”

The weather was great, sunny with a breeze. This was the California I felt familiar with. I felt comfortable and relieved.

I wish my mom and grandparents were here too. I texted them to say that I landed and I’m safe.

The bus took us to a quarantine area. We went through another temperature check and the customs process. The staff was very warm-hearted and helpful. I got my room key and my luggage, and went to my room.

Raw exhaustion kicked in. It was the best sleep I’d had in days.

Day 5

I made myself a cup of coffee. Looking out of the window from my room, it’s a beautiful dawn view. I cannot even grasp where I am and what I am going through. The jet lag hit me badly.

I checked my phone. One message dragged me back to the reality in Wuhan. One of my friends texted to say that his grandma and auntie both passed away from the coronavirus. His dad was still in the hospital.

All of it took me back to everything I had seen in Wuhan.

Day 5

Right before I left Wuhan, I went to my grandparents’ home with my mom to say goodbye. That was the first time I saw my grandpa cry. I could not hug or even touch them.

My grandma handed me a bag with a red envelope and a letter my grandpa had written to me. I held my tears and said goodbye.

That was the hardest goodbye I have ever had.

Day 6

Back on the base, two people in quarantine have tested positive for the coronavirus. People are starting to question the C.D.C. staff.

I have so many questions in my mind, too. But I trust the staff who have supported us since this started and are working 14 hours a day.

“We’re the lucky ones,” I keep saying to people in here. Obviously, not everybody thinks like me. They wrote a petition asking for coronavirus tests for everyone.

In the first few days, the food was really bad, like leftover commercial plane meals.

But I heard that they’re changing the catering vendor for us. I can see they’re improving day by day.

Day 6

We went to a town hall of the people in quarantine. A C.D.C. officer told us that someone with coronavirus was accidentally brought back to the base briefly because of a testing mistake.

People were very angry. They were anxious and wanted to know the names of people who are ill. For privacy reasons, the C.D.C. officer didn’t tell us. I understand people’s concerns, but I think it’s overreacting and pointless.

Day 8

I am not the kind of person who likes to celebrate these sorts of special days. I’m single now, so I have no feeling about Valentine’s Day. (Keep calm and carry on.)

But I wanted to do something to break up this long and boring quarantine. So I ordered Godiva chocolate and gift cards online. I wanted to share them with my dear “neighbors” here in quarantine, two young professional women.

I knocked on my neighbors’ doors and — keeping the 6-foot distance we’ve been asked to keep — passed the bags to them.

Day 8

I went to the regular temperature check in the morning. I gave the C.D.C. staff a Valentine’s Day note.

My heart melted when I saw that the staff had made us a Valentine’s Day corner.

I grabbed a chocolate and a bag of strawberries and left. The only other plan I had for the day: Laundry.

Day 8

After about 10 days in quarantine, I actually see myself as happier than before. I've learned to check the phone less and focus on myself.

I've read books that I hadn’t finished for years. I worked a puzzle in my room alone for six hours.

Day 8

What am I missing the most? The dish my mom and grandma cooked for me when I was in Wuhan.

In here, I spend two or three hours a day contacting my family and friends in Wuhan. I have made new friends here and we talk during breakfast. But mostly I don’t go outside or spend time with other people.

Day 9

The mood has changed a lot here, day by day. The first couple of days, I was feeling safe and finally could sleep better. After the two confirmed cases came out, I felt scared and panicky a little while.

Day 9

I’m not a doctor or a professional, but I’ve been through this. On a physical level, protection is a must. Wear face masks and wash your hands properly and use sanitizer frequently. But on a mental level, do not overreact!

Advertisement

Skip Advertisement

After the doctors and C.D.C. staff explained the whole situation to us, I am pretty confident about my status.

Day 9

It seems like people are treating people who have been through the threat of coronavirus like we’re zombies.

Day 9

We should feel sorry for the people who died because of it. Be respectful to people who are working on it and trying to fix the problem. We should appreciate that we’re the lucky ones.

Don’t put your hate and anxiety on others. It doesn’t solve anything.

Day 14

Day 14

The whole morning was busy, with packing and checking out from the inn on the military base.

We all got a yellow A4-size envelope with a letter stating that we are not a coronavirus risk.

It’s like we graduated from a secret academic program.

Day 14

I am waiting for a flight in San Diego’s airport. It feels so unreal after these days: Everything is normal. No one is wearing face masks. People are sitting around me eating lunch and discussing their lives.

I need some time to adjust my mind. It has been a long wait and a journey to get back home.

I want to say, in my first language:

武汉加油！我的家，我爱你！

(Hang in there, my home, and I love you!)

From my experience, Exway and Ownboard have been fairly responsive and ready to me even during coronavirus. Almost all boards originate from China one way or another plus the quality of manufacturing and assembling these boards isn't necessarily better between the US and China. Boosted and Evolve manufacture in China. It really doesn't take much effort/quality control to make an electric skateboard not crumble within the first hundreds of miles. Without china, we wouldn't even be able to run the boards as they also dominate battery production

Hubs are not only cheap to assemble onto boards, but also cheap to replace and easy to service, honestly, a hidden cost that companies don't explicitly state as they frequently experience more replacement. They're nice for being economical while maintaining adequate to high performance.

With China, you experience lower costs due to the proximity to the supply chain, a large, available, well educated, and cheap labor pool, plus most of these companies are based in Shenzhen, utilizing a techcentric, highly innovative and competitive atmosphere challenging Silicon Valley. Warranties and support could be better, but many companies are trying to plant local firms and warehouses in the US. Meanwhile, the trade war climate made US operations like Exwayusa difficult enough for closure and ruining any future prospect for further chinese-us operations and local support.

Meanwhile, US companies are experiencing evaporation. They generally do have better support, but there are many people who wouldn't pay the extra price of another similar board just for added warranty. Warranty and support doesn't cover up the rate of reliability issues either. It's nice for boosted to replace batteries and motors in the past, but it's not great that these problems are so frequent. I can't attest to that on my v2d+ as I didn't put the board through literal hell, but there's a chain of comments in relation to those problems."

A federal judge late Friday temporarily blocked the U.S. government from quarantining coronavirus patients in Costa Mesa after city officials argued that the surprise proposal came with no information about how surrounding neighborhoods would be protected from the deadly virus.

The city filed a request on Friday afternoon to halt the plan to house 30 to 50 people who tested positive for the coronavirus at the state-owned Fairview Developmental Center until the 109-acre center — which sits next to several residential neighborhoods — is determined suitable for the quarantine and safeguards are put in place to protect the neighboring community.

“It is certainly not an isolated location,” Costa Mesa Mayor Katrina Foley told The Times. “It would certainly be important for us as the lead city to know what the plan is.”

Late Friday, U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton issued a temporary restraining order to halt the transportation of anyone infected with the coronavirus to Costa Mesa and set a hearing for Monday at 2 p.m. to evaluate the merits of the request.

Foley said a city staffer received a call about 5:20 p.m. Thursday from the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, saying that federal officials planned to start moving patients in as early as Sunday. She and other city officials spent the next 24 hours trying to get more details, such as how long the site would be used and how restricted patients would be. They found that the answers to their questions were different depending on who they spoke with, she said.

“We just couldn’t get any answers in any timely fashion,” she said. “We just want to minimize the impact on our residents and businesses.”

So the City Council decided unanimously to file a request for a legal injunction to halt the plan for the Fairview center, which houses a handful of residents and employs a few dozen staff members.

It’s unclear where the coronavirus patients are currently being quarantined.

Health officials in Humboldt and Sacramento counties each [confirmed a case of the coronavirus](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-21/coronavirus-humboldt-sacramento-county-total-california-cases-to-15) this week in residents who had recently traveled to China.

In addition, five people who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and taken to Travis Air Force Base in Solano County have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, the CDC said, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in California to 15.

In total, there are 34 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, CDC officials said earlier Friday; the Sacramento County case would bring that number to 35. Three of the cases were among people evacuated from Wuhan on government-chartered repatriation flights, and 18 were among passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those include the five hospitalized near Travis, plus 11 who are receiving care at University of Nebraska Medical Center near Camp Ashland and two who are being treated at hospitals near Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland.

Here are some traditional tools for protecting yourself from flu virus.

They have been taken from the references at the bottom of this file.

1   Alkalize your body 
     Take about 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in water on an empty stomach first thing in the morning and just before bed time.

2   Iodize your body
     You can use Lugol's solution, nascent iodine, potassium iodide, or even povidone iodine painted on your skin.
      Use about 200 mg a day or more.
       Maintain a level where you have a slight metallic taste in your mouth and iodine painted on the skin takes at least an hour to be absorbed.  (If it takes less than twenty minutes to absorb, you are iodine deficient).

3  Use this potent viricide
     Take five grams of magnesium chloride twice a day (use food grade--not bath flakes).
      If you start to feel flu symptoms, increase to four times a day and consider increasing the dose.

Wuhan virus can be contracted just about every imaginable way (droplets in air or deposited on surfaces, human contact--especially fluids, excrement, etc.)
It is expected to become endemic globally.
That means you can expect to be exposed to it repeatedly.
If you use these three methods of protection along with common sense sanitary practices to avoid heavy exposure, you will stand a good chance of staying healthy.

Drink plenty water.
Wash hands often.
Do not touch your face with unclean hands.
Avoid crowds--especially indoor crowds.
Etc. etc.

Don't panic....

> 1) Since the beginning of this year, Singapore has been much more proactive in tracing patient contacts/paths.

So was korea. They had a handle on everybody who'd been in contact with infected and were very good at tracking them down. If it hadn't been for the cult the number of infected in korea would've remained lower than in singapore.

> 2) Compulsory mask wearing of government/official employees, such as at airports, etc. They've implemented this much earlier than Korea at Incheon airport it seems.

That's not right. Incheon was testing arrivals as soon as news broke out. I believe that they started to issue masks and sanitiser to arrivals immediately but of this I'm not 100% sure.

> 3) Many scientists say that the coronavirus persists for longer at colder temperatures. Singapore's hotter tropical climate causes the virus to last for shorter periods, it seems.
> 4) Singapore deports foreigners that do not comply with quarantines.

The last one I believe needs strengthening in korea, particularly students from china who seem to be refusing self-quarantine."

* The opportunity to be forthcoming and transparent about the test efficacy and availability has come and gone.  

* Yesterday, she was beside herself about the effectiveness, scalability and readiness at the CDC for testing.  Meanwhile walking back any testing even at the 3 states.  In contrast to your quote about it even being reliable to begin with.  So which is it?

* The management of the Diamond Princess infected passengers had no coherent strategy that was communicated with the public, the other departments and the local community leadership.  

* They are in damage control mode right now, no differently than C level player in a corporation who is about to get overthrown by the board of directors or shareholders.    Why do I say that?  Because they are weaving in softly, finger pointing at the FDA and at the states, rather than owning what they committed to the public. 

* We are spending more time in pressers and news media talking about how the counting methodology will be communicated and broken out, and the various bureaucratic guardrails around detail splitting that make the public go insane with confusion, instead of straight dope ""yes, x people in y county have coronavirus"".   

At this stage, I have no confidence in the effectiveness of US testing, the national management of the infected passengers from Diamond Princess, or next steps as designated by the CDC.

Where is  the 24 days is the current understanding coming from exactly? Is this speculation or official information? What's normal for a coronavirus? 24 days seems insanely way too long. SARS, which this is similar to, was only 2-7 days generally and up to 10 days maximum. covid-19 doesn't seem to be *that* different than previous coronaviruses. I have a hard time believing that covid-19 has upended the way these viruses work.

SARS was airborne, so no amount of disinfectant was going to get rid of it. As you may know, entire buildings were getting infected from people doing explosive shits. How do you defend against that?

2020-02-22,NotMarbles,exjw,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/f7v36u/jdub_convo/fifvtwv/,"> Don't forget that sometimes Jehovah lets things happen 

Like Coronavirus. But it's \*sin\* that causes our bodies to be imperfect and thus allows disease to happen. So why was is \*necessary\* to allow sin to be transmitted from Adam to all offspring.

Because J was \*constrained\* to build up this entire thing as a ""we need to make an example of everyone that no-one will ever forgot or question a trillion years from now. We'll settle the question once and for all if you really need me or not!"" (Did I get that right? That's what I got from my mom JW.)

Okay - but it's kind of for show. We know there's no physical way to ""be perfect physically"", so there is objectively more pain / evil in the world because we're all bearing the choice of one person. Let's assume for argument's sake that everything JW say is true and a trillion years from now, someone could possibly say ""oh, see we tried living apart from J and it didn't work out so we better keep doing what he wants."" Or... what if instead of having sin transmit down from Adam, he died from his choice, but his offspring did not. Maybe some would sin, some would not. Those who sinned would die - those who did not sin would live forever. A trillion years from now, we'd still have the same principle ""proven"" to us: ""some tried living apart from J and it didn't work out for them, so we better keep doing what he wants."" Principle proven - but far less pain / evil would have been seen in the world, since not everyone would \*have to\* sin, unlike the current situation. Thus, J is responsible for the choice of transmission, and therefore is responsible for at least some quantity of pain / evil in the world. Being responsible for \*any\* destroys the view of his all-knowing/powerful/good nature.

Help me understand what the PIMI response would be to this - I don't debate with my JW mom anymore, but I've wondered what a response would be."

Worth noting that mortality rate is often underestimated in the initial phase of a new disease. SARS (the closest relative of this new virus) was initially thought to have 3% mortality but it later turned out to be more like 10%. 

It’s much more dangerous than the flu, and we have no vaccine or known treatments.

1|Eizouken|+1|9-10|Eizouken's out here lauding Sakugabooru again. Love it. The first 4 minutes of this episode are an absolute triumph. Gorgeous cut after gorgeous cut, really succinctly showcasing the way that an animator views the world and the different ways body movement makes things shift and flow in 2D. Of course that continued throughout the rest of the episode as well. I found it absolutely beautiful to look at and so passionate too. Just a phenomenal episode all around. Also, it's so refreshing to see a bath scene treated as a part of the mundane, just to showcase the amazing water animation. Eizouken is well on its way to being a masterpiece.
2|Chihayafuru 3|-1|9|I love the combination of ideals between Suo and Harada here. The one feeding off the passion of others, and one fighting passionately for the game of Karuta. Both fighting for someone else though. Such a contrasting dynamic makes for a fascinating match. Luck of the draw...next week can't come fast enough. End of the Queen match came quicker than I was expecting. I was rooting for both, but feel for Inokuma. Loved Shinobu's line at the end.
3|Magia Record|-|8|(7) A connect! I wasn’t sure if those would show up to show up! Very cool. Loved how they stylized the effect, although that's not what Iroha's connect does :P. Anyways, that episode was a rollercoaster. I liked framing it around Felicia's rage and that she finally allows herself to grieve. Added a whole new emotional layer. Plus the Mifuyu drop, and best girl Kyoko crushing it was so fun. Intriguing ending...
4|Natsunagu!|-|7-8|Great episode. So sweet, and Natsuna's little *Nyaa* was adorable. Fun little story of young love too.
5|Toilet-Bound Hanako-Kun|+1|7-8|That radio room design was stellar. Whole episode was tons of fun. Was really interesting to see Hanako truly shaken up for once and for Kou to take center stage. So Hanako seems to have killed a twin brother, but it definitely feels like self defense. Or maybe he killed a part of himself?
6|Koisuru Asteroid|-1|7-8|They are really milking the fact that not everything goes your way this ep. Some heavy foreshadowing with Ao there. I loved the first segment. The stargazing party was adorable, and it's always fun seeing Ao light up talking about astronomy. I like where they're heading with Ino-senpai too.
7|Railgun T|-|7-8|Coronavirus delay :(
8|Fate/Grand Order Babylonia|-|7|Holy mother of fuck that episode was gorgeous and inspiring.  All the people brought back felt a bit out of the blue, but it fit right in with the PURE HYPE.
9|Heya Camp|-|7|Fun to see Rin's grandpa again! Houtou looks so warm and cozy. Maybe I should get a hot-pot for my apartment…
10|ID: Invaded|+1|6-7|No answers, only more questions, but that was an exciting episode. I really enjoyed seeing Anaido and Sakaido working together. The pair of them matched well with the interaction before they dove. It's interesting to see personalities shine through like that. Time to find out more about this Kiki guy next week. Hype.
11|Kabukicho Sherlock|-1|6-7|Very interesting. Sherlock and Moriarty's conversation was as good as I'd hoped. Full of intrigue. These versions of the famous characters play well off each other. I wish we'd seen more of this moriarty lurking throught the cracks of the early episodes, but what can you do. Excited to see this web untangled.
12|22/7|+2|6|Just great. Not only was that the best episode so far story wise, it was also the best episode visually. When animated well, Horiguchi's designs are easily some of the best in anime. So detailed and pretty. I loved Jun's story. Just simple finding solace in friendship and music, and choosing to live for someone else and the impression they made on you. It's powerful and worked *really* well with her actions in real time.
13|BNHA S4 (Dub)|-1|6|(17) Well, I didn't like the way rhe kids arc went about saying what it wanted to say, but that ice slide thing was pretty cool, and I enjoyed seeing Cami's quirk. The Aoyama thing was exceptionally stupid, just like the character.
14|Yatogame-chan S2|-1|5-6|That's a lot of idols...
15|Azur Lane|-|4-5|Done Till March

>“Generally speaking, the heat kills this kind of virus,” he clarified. 

>He mentioned this same theory earlier during a national governor’s meeting at the White House. The New York Times reports that Trump, after praising China’s divisive response to the virus outbreak, said that “The virus that we’re talking about having to do, a lot of people think that goes away in April, with the heat, as the heat comes in, typically that will go away in April.”

Mulan is not the type of movie that European audiences would go huge for, though. Its only major advantage in terms of European appeal is its Disney remake status, and considering it's jettisoning the most appealing (from a European perspective) elements of the original, I could see it making less than Dumbo in Europe.

Also, Onward is a Pixar movie, so its budget is guaranteed to be at least $150 million.

Your domestic prediction looks about right to me, but the only two Pixar originals to make less than 50% of their worldwide gross outside of North America were Toy Story (1995, when the international box office was a fraction of its current size) and Cars (inherently very American). Also, East Asia outside of Japan tends not to be huge for Pixar, and the Japanese box office doesn't seem to have been affected by Coronavirus concerns so far."

That said when he sold it he and me both figured you could replace the pod in it, but it was just a disposable pod...didn't find out till I had left but then went back to the store and they gave me a couple orion pods for free that I could also use on the Q pro so wouldn't be vapeless while trying to track down an actual replacement Q pro pod. But yeah its cool people at vape stores will do stuff like that, of course I was certainly cool about it, didn't just come in b\*tching just showed them the pod wasn't for replaceable coils like we had thought and so they compensated me a couple free pods. I bet if I was all rude and mean I would not have had that outcome. 

But yes I am using that tank right now, and for being a cheap off-brand replacement pod it does have nice flavor and works quite good.

Edit: second link only viewable when linked from google.  Here is the text:

Trucking and depot businesses in China are showing a slow and patchy resumption of operations after crashing to a virtual halt after the Chinese New Year holiday was extended due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak that has crippled factory and industrial output.

Wintry weather in northern China last weekend has created a further challenge, weighing on the return to work at terminals in Dalian, Tianjin, and Qingdao. That comes even as businesses scramble for swift transport options, including air and rail, freight forwarders said.

“Business is recovering with a massive amount of opportunities. Clients are searching for urgent solutions, including aircraft charters and rail between China and Europe,” said one Hong Kong freight forwarder.

Highlighting the impact of the anti-virus measures on China’s trucking industry, a senior Hong Kong-based executive at a European logistics company told JOC.com: “Trucking and traffic limitations remain a major issue, but this is slowly improving.”

“Trucking capacity is much better in north China with around 70 to 80 percent availability as the drivers mainly come from provinces in China,” the executive said. “In central and south China, the recovery is much slower with operations only at 20 to 40 percent capacity as many drivers are from Hubei and surrounding provinces where the epidemic is more widespread.”

“The most critical trucking situation is in Ningbo and all of Zhejiang Province where only 10 to 20 percent of trucks are available because the area is still under restriction and partial lockdown,” the source added.

Authorities in Zhejiang Province have recently published guidance on what measures trucking companies need to take to resume operations, probably from February 23, that will also affect work at the container terminals in Ningbo.

Echoing the Hong Kong executive’s views, Maersk China said, “Trucking capacity remains a key challenge due to local policies and restrictions.”

Hapag-Lloyd said in a customer advisory on Tuesday that all terminals and depots were now open. “However, some are still operating at limited capacity. Furthermore, truckers’ shortage remains an issue,” the carrier said.

CMA CGM and APL said its offices in China would only return to full operations from March 2, although staff would continue to work remotely.
Normal operations not expected until at least March

The resumption of operations is being slowed because of strict measures imposed by local authorities to tackle the virus, including submission of an implementation plan by each business that must be approved before staff can resume work. As a result, normal operations for most factories and businesses are not expected until next month.

A Maersk China spokesperson told JOC.com that nationwide “most of our trucking suppliers have resumed operations,” although they are operating “with less than 50 percent of their staff, since all trucking companies must follow local restrictions to receive a permit to resume operations.”

“To mitigate the trucking capacity issue, Maersk is introducing a multi-modal bundle service along the Yangtze river, especially in the Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou areas,” she added. “Trucks will connect to barge or rail services serving Maersk’s Shanghai container terminals and make empty equipment available in these city areas.”

But there are pockets where trucking is operating almost normally.

Hacis, the cross-border trucking company owned by Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, said none of its services have been suspended so far and the only disruption to normal operations was the extension of the Chinese New Year holiday to February 9 by the Guangdong provincial government.

Vivien Lau, Hacis managing director, told JOC.com the Hong Kong and Guangdong governments have exempted truckers from border closures introduced to prevent the spread of the virus, provided they pass frontier health inspections, including temperature checks.

Hacis provides freight services between Hong Kong International Airport and a raft of destinations in China, including the Pearl River delta bordering Hong Kong and further north to cities such as Xiamen and Chongqing.

In Jinan, capital of northern China’s Shandong Province, Jennifer Jiang, export manager of truck and crane supplier Qingong International Group, said the virus outbreak has had little impact on its business.

“We started work from last week,” she said. “There is no problem for truck production and delivery. It is busy because of more orders.”

The Hong Kong logistics executive said most warehouses in China’s coastal cities reopened last week, but with limited activity due to the labor and truck shortages. But he pointed out that large factories are resuming operations much faster, while a lot of small factories in central and southern China will only restart operations at the beginning of March.

Companies including Tesla, Honeywell, computer maker Lenovo, and agricultural giant Cargill all confirmed most of their plants resumed work on February 10. But others, including Hong Kong-listed printed circuit board maker Confidence Intelligence, said Tuesday they have yet to hear from the authorities in Shenzhen when it will be able to restart production.
Reefer situation in Shanghai still unsettled

Pointing to the terminal situation, the Hong Kong logistics executive said the reefer situation in Shanghai and at Tianjin’s Xingang terminals remains serious. Reefers for state-owned food processing company COFCO are receiving priority at the two ports.

“Qingdao is becoming the key port for accommodating excessive reefers for Shanghai and Ningbo,” the source said.

Both Fuzhou and Shantou are experiencing low productivity with about 60 percent trucker availability.

In Wuhan, capital of central China’s Hubei Province and where the outbreak of the coronavirus was first reported in December, the local government has announced depot operations will not resume until at least February 21.

Wintry weather has added to shippers’ woes, with snow over the weekend in Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Lianyungang slowing the release and return of empty containers where volumes are 50 percent of normal levels. Fog has also affected operations at Shanghai and Xiamen.

The Hong Kong logistics executive estimated that more than 1 million TEU of capacity has been withdrawn on Far East-west board routes until week 13 — March 23-29. “A massive shortfall of capacity is anticipated from Europe in April and May,” he said.

China Renaissance, a Hong Kong-based brokerage, said delays in the resumption of work due to the extended holiday and virus-related restrictions could cost 1,371 billion RMB ($196 billion) in lost GDP. But this could be offset by a gain of 1,106 billion RMB in GDP if firms ramp up production in March.

“Logistics, including distribution of goods both locally and nationwide, is one of the biggest bottlenecks at this point amid the virus outbreak,” the brokerage said in a research report on Monday.

“Due to the virus outbreak, even in tier-1 cities with higher volumes than lower-tier cities, logistics demand this year is below 30 percent and volume stands only at about 10 percent of normal volumes after Chinese New Year,” the brokerage added.

2020-02-22,WillSmokeStaleCigs,wallstreetbets,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7whfu/oil_calls/fiiw2hv/," I’ve been thinking about buying some Petrobras puts lately and wanted to share my DD. 

I wrote this on feb 14th and never ended up posting it:


Petrobras had a record quarter Q4 of last year, producing over 3 million barrels of Lula crude per day. Riding high on their successes, Petrobras purchased storage rights in Chinese ports to store oil for immediate sale to Chinese “teapots”. Petrobras also last month offered up more than 700 million shares for sale, generating billions in cash.

Petrobras is looking good right now.

So why buy puts? 

China has halted imports from Latin American crude due to the coronavirus. For whatever reason, closely guarded Chinese secret or otherwise (I’m leaning toward lower activity due to quarantine protocol) China doesn’t need the oil right now. 

In fact, Petrobras may already be filling their storage tanks to capacity, which are not cheap to rent.

- https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-30/virus-scare-grinds-to-a-halt-china-demand-for-latin-american-oil

Lula oil, which Petrobras owns a 65% stake in, can only be processed by advanced refineries, such as those in the US and China. 

But coronavirus won’t last forever right? Right, but not quite. 

China being China is suspected to be lowballing reports of coronavirus spread. After disappearing the virus’s discoverer, disappearing hospital workers, poor quarantine practice and media controls, it’s not surprising to hear the truth.

Bottom line: Petrobras appears to be doing better than they actually are, and could have a terrible Q1 earnings report."

Here are some excerpts from the Costa Mess injunction filed yesterday (fortunately granted by a federal court), asking for a temporary restraining order to block the feds from moving dozens of patients infected with coronavirus from the Travis air base to a dilapidated building in Costa Mesa, California:

“The California State Department of General Services recently performed a site survey of Fairview and deemed it unsuitable for use as an emergency shelter, as it would require two years and $25 million in renovations to make it properly habitable. (Barlow Declaration at ¶3). Fairview is an inappropriate location for a quarantine, as there is no way to restrict access to or from the facility; it is in some places about two hundred yards from residential neighborhoods, and there are no security measures in place to keep the quarantined individuals isolated from each other and from the residents of Costa Mesa, a city of over 113,000 people, with a population density of over 7,100 people per square mile.”

“Defendants are depending on local ambulance services to transport infected individuals in need of hospitalization to local hospitals. (Dempsey Decl. Ex., Jim Acosta 2/20/20 email)”

“Instead of taking measures to prevent the entry and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States in accordance with the Public Health Service Act, the CDC – which initially opposed the entry of infected people into the country even though they were being directed to a tightly guarded Air Force base isolated from population centers – now seeks to put them in the middle of a densely populated residential area.”

Sounds like great minds at work on this 🤔"

Be greedy when market fears.
In the middle end of the outbreak could be the best time to buy, people aren't interested investing in it and majority of bearish people had shorted.
Its just a matter of time Coronavirus effect on economy will be contained. 
Whether when is that is different story. 
SARs, MERs and many other diseases had proved SP500 recovered and broke resistance lines within 6months.
It'll be fine to hold if you're in this for long term or short for the short term and invest in stocks that is less likely affected by coronavirus (May not be wise choice as those stocks had already priced accordingly, but you pay for lower risk)
But for short term investors, short and don't invest. 

However, AMD is kind of neutral stock here IMHO. It isn't immune yet it isn't vulnerable either compared to other stocks due to: 
1. TSMC is in Taiwan. A sea away from China. It isn't immune but it isn't China. But with virus spreading thru SG and SEOUL, this could still be a concern. 
2. Semiconductor plants worker typically wear PPE in sterile environment. 
3. Online demand soared in China to battle coronavirus
4. UMC and TSMC still expect the same earnings. It has history of not being affected by SARs either. 
5. However, AMD was highly volatile. Meaning there are more short term investors and traders exiting or exited the game during such scenario, likely to create a new lower trend line that's less volatile with fairer valuation. Resulting, 46 was the previous bottom. 59 didn't made sense. 53? The correction might already be done.

Stocks like Airlines, Amazon, Apple, Starbucks will go bottom.
But as some goes down, some goes up. 

Software companies like Microsoft could be a strong buy.

I'm neutral on AMD short term."

In the meantime all staff and nearby patients that came into contact spend an indefinite amount of time in isolation until results come back. Several scares so far where wards are closed, but none that have resulted in an actual case, otherwise we'd be in the news I'm sure. 

Apparently there all dozens of people there quarantined in a separate building away from the main hospital buildings who they suspect of having coronavirus, but thus far testing has been negative. As for the main entrance to that, apparently their is a massive white tent with hazmat suited staff just outside. She hasn't gone any closer to it than that as you can imagine!

Most of the staff are anxious as fuck, many are washing their hands after every patient they come across and there is a lot of anger towards the patients that keep coming in to the hospital itself, completely ignoring NHS advice to call 111 and LET THEM COME TO YOU.

Will coronavirus shortages lead to non performing loans? Possibly. More devastating will be if it goes viral (literally) in America. With businesses not opening and the vast majority of businesses running on credit things could get tight very quick setting off a chain of loans getting called in and firesales of assets.
2) The Fed would have to choose respond to this credit crunch with slashing interests to zero and provide liquidity to failing banks with a TARP like program i.e. buying up T bills and any other junk they have.
3) Such measures have to FAIL. 
4) The yield on off the run new debt must RISE. i.e the only private buyers of new government debt will only do so for massive compensation. In which case the fed will be the only buyer left purchasing gov debt by effectively printing new dollars that are getting spent directly into the economy with no means of dollars ever being reabsorbed back into the fed and out the economy. The money supply and price rises will be thus irrevocable and permanent. This is hyperinflation."

Of course Cameron is going to say that, but it hasn't been shown to the public yet so you have no idea if that's true or not.

>This movie is very highly anticipated in China where it legitimately might make a billion if of course by that time China recovers from the coronavirus.

But didn't the first one get 200m in China? I understand that China's percentage of global box office revenue has multiplied & their number of cinemas of doubled since the first one. But even if we  quadruple that figure it's not reaching a billion. The biggest box office take in China for a movie is just over 800m and Avengers Endgame, the biggest foreign movie there, made just over 600m in China, that was an extremely anticipated movie in China. So could you please tell me what you're basing this on? 

>. I can guarantee that Europe is gonna eat this movie up.

The original did gross over 1 Billion from Europe, so I think that's a fair assumption *if* the movie turns out to as big a leap in technology as the first one was. But again, considering we haven't actually seen anything from it yet, it's not logical to make huge claims like that.

>Am I talking out of my ass? Somewhat, but so are you.

I'm not though, I haven't made any claims. What I'm saying is that there's nothing to base these huge predictions on, you're all just assuming that the CGI will be out of this world and that audiences will respond the same as they did in 2009. This isn't even factoring in how 3D was a big selling point for the original, 90% of advanced ticket sales in the US were for a 3D screening. 

I'm not saying it can't become even bigger than the first one, I do hope that the CGI turns out to be something we've never seen before. I don't doubt that it will be impressive, but at this stage people are used to big CGI movies whereas at the time it was audiences first experience with that. So we have to wait see how impressive it really is and how big of a leap it can realistically make over other films."

Maybe if they want to invade other countries with their military, the virus would help to weaken the other country first. But let's be real, that ain't going to happen.

China will only lose more and more economy wise if more of the world has the coronavirus. It would be a terrible idea for the CCP and their country to purposely infect other countries.

Edit: Just wanted to add that, if it was contained in China and defeated... China's economy couldn't just freeze and fail and be 'left in the dust' while the rest of the world continues. The world is far more connected and interdependent than you seem to think. If China completely disappeared off the face of the earth tomorrow, a lot of the world's economy would severely tank. There would be severe shortages of textiles, manufacturing parts, putting thousands and thousands of companies out of business. The entire world would start running out of all types of medications before too long, putting a lot of lives at risk. Unfortunately, there might actually be a shortage of medications coming already.

I'll be honest, I have limited knowledge on the subject, but from what I do know I just don't see what anyone in the world has to gain from China having this virus, or what China could possibly gain from the rest of the world having this virus.

That's still super dangerous, as it's on the low end of the estimated lethality of the Spanish flu which infected about a third of the world's population and killed millions in the 20's.

In fact low lethality is the problem, as it makes it easier for the disease to spread further and so kill more people. Something like Ebola with its very high lethality tends to burn through hosts too quickly to go pandemic, and also tends to be a bit easier to spot. Coronavirus has a long incubation period, seemingly high infectivity, and a portion of cases are infectious but asymptomatic. 

Not to say that we the citizens should be panicking, there's no point in that, but health officials and governments should take precautions to reduce the chance of this thing going mainstream. 

And perhaps it would be a good idea to get some cans of soup next time you go to the grocery store. That way if there are a few cases nearby and people panic, you don't have to go out to get food."

You are being voted down because you aren't paying attention to the *reason* the seller wants the buyer to cancel. Since AliExpress rates both buyers and sellers, taking the hit for a seller being out of stock (by cancelling using untrue reasons that reflect badly on *buyer*) makes no sense at all.

Seller can cancel the order, but would look bad to AliExpress. Instead, seller wants *buyer* to take the hit on the cancellation. That isn't being understanding, that is being a chump.

Don't cancel; seller can't ship, so you will get refund anyway. If seller gives bogus tracking number to make it look like seller shipped, seller will eventually lose dispute and it will take a little longer to receive refund. But in those situations, seller takes the hit for not delivering the goods promised.

There *should* be a mutual agreement to cancel where neither are faulted by AliExpress, but to my knowledge there isn't one.

> I hope that if you keep the order, it gets shipped to you and you get n-coronavirus. It does survive longer in cold temps after all, so the long shipping time won't really affect it much.

Fairview is surrounded on three sides by a golf course and abuts a residential neighborhood. It includes more than a dozen mostly empty buildings that would likely require substantial preparation to serve as a medical facility

> SINGAPORE: By the time she found out she was afflicted with COVID-19, the worst had already been over for her.

> 

> The 39-year-old Singaporean woman - also known as case number 33 - had spent a week unconscious in the intensive care unit as doctors fought to save her.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> She was finally given a clean bill of health and discharged earlier this week. The woman and her sister who both attend Life Church and Missions at Paya Lebar spoke to CNA about their battle with the disease.

> 

> The 39-year-old was initially warded at Sengkang General Hospital for pneumonia on Feb 2.

> 

> Doctors desperately tried to treat an infection for the 39-year-old that affected both lungs. Her fever just kept coming back, and she grew increasingly breathless.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> “It was like she was running a marathon on the bed,” said her sister.

> Her health deteriorated over the next four days to the point that she became critically ill. “She was on the maximum limit of oxygen support in the general ward setting, and the doctor thought that she would be better taken care of in the ICU,” said her sister.

> A WEEK IN THE ICU

> The 39-year-old was wheeled into the ICU on Feb 6.

> “My last memory was (feeling) a little panicked because I didn’t know what to expect … But I just had to trust that the medical team knows what they are doing,” she said. The last thing she remembered was a mask being put over her face to sedate her, and she slowly drifted off.

> Her sister said doctors faced difficulties getting enough oxygen in her blood. “So they paralysed her with medication to totally knock her out, so (machines) can take over her work of breathing, hoping that they can rest her lungs,” said the sister.

> Around the same period, the Government began testing all pneumonia cases for the coronavirus.

> A monitoring device attached to a patient's arm.

> On Feb 6, she was confirmed as Singapore's COVID-19 case number 33. The call to family members came the next day morning. “I was very stunned because I thought the likelihood was low, but they were pretty sure,” said her sister.

> What ensued was “madness”, said the sibling.

> Government officers from the Ministry of Health and Singapore Police Force started calling her to help with contact tracing. “I was receiving calls till my battery went flat,” she said.

> 

> Ambulances were also sent to take all the family members – including a one-month old child – to different hospitals for screening. They were eventually cleared, and sent home to serve out quarantine orders.

> Meanwhile in the ICU, doctors were considering an advanced life support technique called ECMO if they still could not get enough oxygen into her body. The procedure would mean that the medical team would have to transfer her to Singapore General Hospital.

> Eventually, that option was no longer needed as her condition stabilised in the ICU.

> Doctors had also given her medication typically used to treat HIV patients. The medical team then attempted to lift her out of the medically-induced paralysis by cutting down her sedation.

> An RFID tag used to monitor the patient's temperature.

> But doctors told the family members that once they did that, she “became very agitated and started to wrestle a little unconsciously”, due to the discomfort of having breathing tubes in her.

> 

> “We were thinking that if we were her we would also be very agitated, being put through all these uncomfortable things in an unfamiliar place,” said the sister. Because the family couldn’t be by her side to comfort her, they recorded audio messages of encouragement instead.

> “We (told her) she would be fine … and all the invasive things on her were transient, and going to help her for a period of time only,” the sister said. That worked, and slowly, doctors were able to reduce the amount of sedation she needed.

> Friends from the church also rallied around the family.

> “When I started to gain consciousness, I saw nurses and medical staff around me. There were tubes connected to my mouth,” she said.

> The woman said she was confused when she was told that she had the COVID-19 infection. Till today, she does not know how she caught the virus.

> Food is delivered to patients through a secured hatch.

> After being moved out of the ICU on Feb 13, she spent the rest of her days in the hospital in an isolation ward where she slowly regained her strength. She was free to go home on Feb 18.

> “If you are sick because of the coronavirus, you are probably (one of) the most important patients in Singapore right now,” said case 33’s sister. “This disease didn't kill her,” she added.

> 

> BREATHING FELT LABORIOUS

> Another woman in the same cluster, case 38, said she had a different experience fighting the infection.

> “People thought I (would be in) extreme pain, and probably looked absolutely skin and bones … I dispelled that (misconception) through video calls,” said the 52-year-old woman, who was also discharged from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases earlier this week.

> While her breathing felt laborious at the worst point of her illness, case 38 said doctors told her it was her own immunity that fought off the virus.

> The most challenging thing for her was the 10-day stay in the isolation ward. Doctors spoke to her mostly through the phone. Even her temperature was monitored by an RFID tag, while her food was sent through a secured hatch.

> A typical meal served to those staying in an isolation ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

> “People joke about being stranded on an island, but it does feel that way,” she said.

> “I had everything that I needed, but it was the lack of human contact,"" she added.

> While she saw “love in action” when friends reached out and sent her daily encouragements, there were those who questioned if the church had taken enough precautions against the virus.

> Others were fearful and anxious that they had gotten the infection from her.

> “Entire families had to be quarantined – which meant that work and schooling, and generally their way of life was affected. There was some fear, which I can understand,” she said, adding that it did not even dawn on her to blame the church or anyone for her COVID-19 infection.

> “I used the opportunity to comfort others in fear … and (used) my experience as a form of encouragement and testimony to those who were worried,” she added.

> The 52-year-old also saw the sacrifices nurses and medical staff had to make.

> “I felt extreme compassion for them,” she said.

> 

> “You can sense the tiredness, and also the courage they have in spite of all of these,” she said, urging Singaporeans to share more appreciation for frontline staff.

> 

> “This too, will come pass,” added case 38. “We have survived SARS. Today, we are in the midst of surviving COVID-19.”

Because of this 2 to 3 week average delay from an infection event until the public may learn something about it, several weeks of time need to pass before we see what effects each area might experience. 

To put this into perspective, China started locking down at the end of Jan 2020 and some travel bans went into effect.

We are just seeing clusters appear in other areas now  (S Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran) that probably got started just before or around the end of Jan.

( [Link](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/additionary-precautionary-measures-to-minimise-risk-of-community-spread-in-singapore---28-jan-2020.pdf) )   
At this point of time, when in Jan, all teachers/students/healthcare/eldercare sectors with travel history to China in the last 14 days are all subjected to compulsory leave of absence for 14 days  ([Link](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/wuhan-virus-singapore-to-impose-14-days-leave-of-absence-for-those-in-schools-healthcare)).   
Also on this day, all pneumonia patients in public hospitals in Singapore are being tested for COVID-19. ([Link](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/all-pneumonia-patients-in-public-hospitals-here-being-tested-for-coronavirus-moh))  
**This on the onset already protect the schools and hospitals (lessons learnt from SARS)**. 
   * This was escalated on 31st Jan when WHO declare it a public health emergency on 30st Jan. Singapore has assessed that it is prudent to take additional pre-emptive measures at this stage.  From 1 February 2020, 2359h, all new visitors **(regardless of nationalities)** with recent travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days will not be allowed entry into Singapore, or to transit through Singapore. All visas be it to-be-issued, or issued will be suspended. Residents/Work Pass holders can enter but with compulsory quarantine. ([Link](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/extension-of-precautionary-measures-to-minimise-risk-of-community-spread-in-singapore)) For work pass holders who flout quarantine, lifetime ban from working in SG, and the company they worked for also face heavy penalty. ([Link](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-coronavirus-singapore-loa-breach-work-pass-12413478)) This ensure the no one will ""chance"" the quarantine.
   * On 7th Feb,  all work pass holders with travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days and planning to enter/return to Singapore after 2359 hours, 8 February 2020, will be required to obtain prior approval before they commence their journey. This is regardless of the nationality of the work pass holder. Penalty is heavy if they even arrived in SG without approval letter. ([Link](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2020/0207-new-requirements-for-employers-with-wph-returning-from-china)) 
   * On 12th Feb, the government announced that it will foot bills of infected patients at public hospitals. (regardless of nationalities) This coverage does not extend to outpatient treatment at general practitioner clinics or polyclinics, nor does it apply to treatment sought at private medical facilities.   
**So it effectively encourage people with symptoms to go forward to get tested in public hospitals, included non-citizens, tourists, etc. Aka flushing out potential suspected cases.** ([Link](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coronavirus-government-to-foot-bills-of-infected-patients-at-public-hospitals))
* Guessed Singapore did not anticipate Church clusters, and there was a huge jump in the couple of days when the 2nd church clusters was discovered. With the discovery of Church cluster. The church community in Singapore also start to indefinitely suspend services. ([Link](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-catholic-church-to-suspend-mass-indefinitely-advises-events-to-be-suspended)) Most mega churches also start to turn to online services/mass. 
* True that Singapore is a small country, one city, and small land size compared to other countries. But it is a super densely populated city. Imagine \~6 million people squeezed on a land size that is 700+ square km (or about 270+ sq miles). Any potential community spread is serious.
* All these early measures / testings / flushings help greatly to find and confirm potential confirmed cases *early*. **This is important because the earlier you find the infected, the less time they have to infect others.** 
* So there was a huge lead in Singapore confirmed numbers early on (think last week), when suspected cases are being flushed out. But with these people being isolated and treated, and all their close contacts being quarantined. They have no chance to infect others. So chances of further potential community spread are reduced.

**And so, the number of confirmed cases in Singapore ""goes up slowly"" in relative to current S.Korea/Japan situation.** 

Hopefully with all these measures taken, there will not be a super spreader lurking around undetected in the community or on the streets of Singapore at the moment."

Coronavirus is contagious 2 weeks before you get symptoms and realise you are not feeling well. We will probably all get it. It's naive to believe we can stop this now.

>> Once a pandemic starts with coronavirus of international significance, it will be about 1.5-2.5years before the vaccines can be properly researched,tested and distributed.

But how does that ensure market will dip/crash in the coming weeks? It's likely coronavirus fear are already priced in."
