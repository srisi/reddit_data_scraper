Yesterday I looked around for news about people stockpiling food, water and medicine in Europe as the outbreak is just starting there. And I found a few of them that were recent.

You can find them by google translating ""food"" or ""stockpiling"" to different languages in europe and set google to show only the last weeks articles, and search for ""food/stockpiling coronavirus"".

I might be wrong, and the media will start to change their tune over this weekend to calm people. But I have my doubts. And I almost feel like any news on the virus is bad news unless it's news of a cure."

The next big financial risk is from ETF and buying into index funds by millennials. 

It surprises me that so few of us care about valuation methods anymore because hey timing market is not possible, we are here for a long game, all will keep going up, there is new money supply etc etc reasons. By justifying buying at all costs, we blow the prices in stratosphere and intelligent investors like Warren Buffet will get off the train in time taking returns off these long term players every few years. 

Now one may ask, what’s wrong with that. As long as Im better off after some 20-30 years, I should be good. Wrong. Trading is actually a transaction between two people-buyer and a seller. One of them is going to be a loser while other one being a winner in this deal. Every time big fish wins, wealth gap increases a little bit, and with that comes a lot of other social problems which doesn’t show up immediately. But they eventually do - rise of fascism with a Trump. If we are not close to threshold, doesn’t mean we are immune. 

Its much easier for big fishes to eat these small fishes compared to other big fishes like them. This rise of buy-hold-buy really bothers me, and Im getting more and more concerned about the rise of index funds. 12% fall in 5 days demonstrate this. Its steep fall compared to what little news is there yet about COVID-19. Its because some big fishes gobbled a big soup of small fishes. Looking forward to hear what others have to say."

The fact that they are putting off a May conference suggests that they don't believe they'll be back to normal production until after that, which would mean you won't likely be able to get one in time, sadly.
 
 
Hence, you may need to buy another headset before they are all sold out too(they'll all be likely affected soon by production slow downs/halts in China).  Demand is increasing as this shortage continues, which will only make headsets even more scarce to find."

This is for the family of coronaviruses. Not specifically nCoV.



>The first section of the new paper focuses on how long coronaviruses can survive on inanimate surfaces, such as tables and door handles. The authors show that, depending on the material and the conditions, human coronaviruses can remain infectious from 2 hours to 9 days.
At temperatures of around 4°C or 39.2oF, certain versions of the coronavirus could remain viable for up to 28 days. At temperatures of 30–40°C (86–104°F), coronaviruses tended to persist for a shorter time.
At room temperature, a coronavirus responsible for the common cold (HCoV-229E) persisted significantly longer in 50% humidity than 30% humidity. Overall, the authors conclude:
“Human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces at room temperature for up to 9 days. At a temperature of 30°C [86°F] or more, the duration of persistence is shorter. Veterinary coronaviruses have been shown to persist even longer for 28 d[ays].”
When the scientists delved into the literature on the persistence of coronaviruses on different surfaces, the results were variable. For instance, the MERS virus persisted for 48 hours on a steel surface at 20°C (68°F). However, on a similar surface and at the same temperature, TGEV survived for up to 28 days.
Similarly, two studies investigated the survival of two strains of SARS coronavirus on a paper surface. One survived 4–5 days, the other for just 3 hours."

That's why math is useful... to be able to predict correctly statistical data , which even if Not complete , as i said , the Flu has between 350k - 600k victims/ year ... yeah , a great margin as will this coronavirus turn out to be on the long run.

Keep in mind that our doctors found that cluster by coincidence, because they didn't follow the international protocol (which says you have to test only those who have symptons and have been in China or in contact with somebody with the virus more or less) and tested a person who shouldn't have been tested. Then they started investigating and testing everybody in that zone.

Fear is causing bigger problems than the virus.

Btw, people are living as usual and the situation IS NOT BAD.

You answer the phone, and they say something along the lines of HI this is is so & so from so & so can I have a few minutes of your time to ask you a few questions? Again 99.9% of the time most of us dont even let them finish that sentence. CLICK we hang up.

So, by and large, the only people who actually answer polls are either retirees just wanting someone to talk to or people who are too stupid to hang up. The lowest common denominator. So I'm not surprised 38% think corona beer has some affiliation with the coronavirus. I'd say at least 38% of people who actually go through with a solicitation call and answer a poll are simply...moronic."

It is worth noting that in the first edition of “The Eyes of Darkness” in 1981, the fictional virus was not named after the Chinese city, but after a Russian locality named “Gorki” (Gorki-400). In the original version of the novel, the virus was developed outside of “Gorki” and it was meant to be the “Soviet’s most important, dangerous new biological weapon in the decade”. [...] According to the South China Morning Post, the name of the virus was changed on the re-release of the book in 1989, toward the end of the Cold War. 
[Source - reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-coronavirus-koontz-book/partly-false-claima-1981-book-predicted-the-coronavirus-2019-outbreak-idUSKCN20M19I)

“Starting in 1986, relations between the US and the Soviet Union began improving,” says Jenny Smith, co-founder of indie bookshop Bleak House Books in Hong Kong and a student of Russian history. “Mikhail Gorbachev came in in 1985 and was very interested in making the Soviet Union a more open society and improving relations.”[...] An American author pointing the fictional finger of blame at Russia would not have gone down well in that climate, so The Eyes of Darkness needed a new villain. [...] 

“China is the only place that comes to my mind that would have had an active programme and it’s likely there was a deep suspicion [in the US] of China covering a lot of things in this period,” says Smith, who wrote her PhD on Soviet technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. This was in the immediate aftermath of the
1989 student demonstrations and the bloody Tiananmen crackdown that followed. It was a period when there were rumours swirling about leaks and cover-ups at biological weapons facilities, says Smith, and the US would have been aware of the repression of these rumours. The switch from Gorki-400 to Wuhan-400 in the book was a literal cut-and-paste and appears to reflect the shift in mentality after the Cold War. [...]

It is not known whether Koontz himself requested this change or his publisher made it. Emails to Koontz, his literary agent and publisher have gone unanswered.

In general, ""lying"" is protected speech unless it meets very specific criteria. 

Applying that to this speech would be dangerous. Trump, as usual, is vomiting up some word salad here. But it would be easy to argue that his main point is that the ""hoax"" by Democrats is that he's doing a bad job in dealing with the virus. He is downplaying the risk here, but it would also be easy to argue that he does really believe that coronavirus and the flu are comparable in danger to the public, so defamation/libel won't apply and there is no law against lying to the public like that.

To declare this garbage unprotected speech would be a problem. A more authoritarian-leaning government could use that as the basis to shut down any health-related speech that it doesn't like. Or, it could go back to shutting down speech against war since stopping the draft could be argued to present a danger to Americans because it affects defense."

They were a little tipsy when i got there but i soon caught up and after a few beers Sam and u get into a conversation on music and she pulls out a guitar. Now im not the best guitar player in the world but i know a few songs and this common interest led us to drinking and passing the guitar back and forth whilst Bill and Sarah watched. Sam talked about how she had hitchhiked around Europe getting jobs in bars playing guitar and we got into some really deep conversations. We were really hitting off and she seemed so interesting and down to earth. In the bat of an eye shit hit the fan though...

Bill starts talking about the coronavirus and segregation in China with muslims which somehow spirals into a debate about global politics and religion. Turns out Sam had some things to say on the matter and she goes off on a huge tangent on how god is real and how she has spoke to him and granted her miracles and she can stop rain by praying and she has undeniable proof and that anyone that thinks otherwise should be sacrificed. Me being an atheist thought this was a joke and started laughing along with her story until she looked me dead in the eye and told me she was serious. I had no idea what the fuck to say and how to get off the subject but things kept spiralling as she talked about all the miracles god has performed for her...

I quickly noped the fuck out of the situation and told everyone i wasnt feeling too well and tried to leave. When i tried to get up she started to grab me and scream about how god is real and i need to believe in order to be saved...

All the while this is going on Bill and Sarah are nodding in agreement and asking why im an atheist. Never before in conversations with bill -- who i had known for 10+ years-- had anything about religion come up and i am just dumbfounded.

The new target, however, failed to satisfy some climate-change activists who flocked outside JPMorgan’s New York headquarters, partially blocking some entrances and demanding that the bank get rid of fossil-fuel clients.
At the investor meet, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said she was confident that the bank’s near to medium-term growth would be backed by a robust U.S. economy, despite some near-term headwinds.
“We can outperform on a relative basis regardless of the environment,” Piepszak said. “Although risks are more skewed to the down side given ... risks like coronavirus, we are confident that the strength of our operating model will continue to demonstrate strength.”
The bank projected that return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a key measure used to determine how well a bank is using its shareholders’ money, will be the same as last year’s target of 17%.
However, JPMorgan cut its outlook for net interest income (NII) to $57 billion for 2020 from $57.8 billion in 2019, blaming lower interest rates.
The bank forecast NII of $60 billion or more for 2021, which was above analysts’ estimates.
The bank also forecast higher expenses of $67 billion, compared with $65.3 billion last year, despite a “reduction in structural expenses.”
The presentation showed that JPMorgan’s outlook remained unchanged for profit at its corporate & investment bank (CIB), a disappointment for analysts who had expected the lender to push for higher growth at the unit that accounted for a third of total revenue in 2019.
It expects return on equity of 16%, unchanged from the target that was set a year ago.
Targeted return on equity stayed unchanged at 25%-plus for the consumer & community banking segment, and remained flat at 18% for the commercial banking segment.
JPMorgan also maintained the outlook for the asset and wealth management business and said it expected a 25%-plus return on equity in the medium term.

Survival strongly depends on age, location, gender and medical history. Women are less likely to pass away, and so are people with a properly functioning immune system who don't smoke, for example.

Also:

> Chinese scientists who looked at nearly 45,000 confirmed cases in the current COVID-19 outbreak concluded the death rate was 2.3%. But there are questions about whether all cases are being counted: Infected people with only mild symptoms may be missing from the tally. That means the true fatality rate may be lower.

And:

> The flu's mortality rate is 0.1%, yet it kills hundreds of thousands around the world each year because it infects millions. So the size of the outbreak matters as much as the lethality in terms of how deadly a disease is.

> **Wat is thuisquarantaine?**

> We spreken van thuisquarantaine als iemand die niet ziek is thuis moet blijven totdat zeker is dat deze persoon niet besmettelijk is voor anderen. Deze periode duurt maximaal 2 weken in het geval van het nieuwe coronavirus. De beoordeling en monitoring wordt door de GGD Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdienst  gedaan. De persoon in quarantaine verblijft thuis in een eigen ruimte. Samen met zijn of haar huisgenoten krijgen zij informatie over maatregelen die genomen moeten worden om eventuele besmetting te voorkomen.

Quarantine is one of the most effective ways to stop an epidemic and it's bound to happen if the number of infected keep rising. Quarantine won't just benefit you, it will also benefit others:

- It will slow down the spread of the virus significantly

- It will relieve over-exhausted medical personnel

- Faster containing of the virus = faster recovery of our economy

So do your part and contribute in the best way possible by preparing for quarantine. Not stocking up on supplies is foolish, dangerous and will eventually make you a burden to others in times of crisis.

You should have enough food for at least 2 to 3 months. There are plenty of lists online on what to buy. Take care."

It’s likely to be 5%.  Maybe more we arent through this. So figures will certainly be screwed. 

Even the BBC suggests 5 % when you look at “serious complications” ie deaths. 

I’m not sure the world would be that worried at 1 % tbh. Not sure I would be. But it’s higher.  That means if this does spread like some epidemiologists are suggesting. Well you do the math."

International trade and division of labor with productivity increases is what has helped the world become wealthier and has dropped costs for the average American consumer. 

The thing is is that at least part the reason why “jobs have left” the US is *because* of productivity increases of workers in industries which leads to a higher marginal productivity of labor, and thus higher wages. 

One example is [manufacturing](https://www.garynorth.com/public/14455.cfm). It takes less workers to do the work it took when the nation’s capital stock was smaller and less advanced. There’s other reasons that contribute to jobs going elsewhere that aren’t necessarily good.

So I don’t think “bringing back jobs” is a necessary or even worthwhile goal. Let labor be allocated to where it is best suited."

It's estimated 1.9 EXCESS (above the normal total number of) deaths due to respiratory symptoms per 10000 cases based on recent research from 2015, with most occuring in poorly resourced countries. This was mild compared to the 2018 flu, but still 10X more than the 2009 flu pandemic. Influenza deaths vary widely year to year, with mortality rates fluctuating wildly. For example, the 2019-2020 flu so far has a mortality rate between 0.04% and 0.14% among infected individuals (in the US only). Overall, COVID-19 is much much worse. 

I also realize that most people are confusing mortality rate globally among all people versus mortality rate among those infected. And mortality rate comparisons in Europe and America's versus mortality rates in Asia are typically very different as well. So far, COVID-19 has a mortality rate of 3.4% AMONG INFECTED INDIVIDUALS (most of which are in Asia).  This does not mean that you (the average American/European) have a 3.4% chance of death. The majority of deaths are occuring in Asia which is not unusual when looking at other worldwide viral phenomena (influenza), with mortality rates significantly dropping off in Europe and US/Canada who typically do not live in such close quarters, have better access to healthcare in general with more resources allocated per individual, etc.

2020-02-29,pooheygirl,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbcirj/australia_business_leaders_from_china_are_among/fj3gprp/," 

Almost 100 foreign citizens who had been in China — many of them “business leaders” — were snuck in Australia’s back door after the federal government gave them an exemption from the coronavirus travel ban.

It is understood the business leaders, diplomats and other travellers allowed to enter Australia passed an initial health screening and state health departments rubber-stamped the request. Each individual was also required to self-isolate for 14 days.

However, medical research platform medRxiv has warned that, based on cases from China, symptoms may not manifest themselves for as long as 24 days.

Obviously there is also the concern that one or more of these special exemptions may have broken their self-isolation at some stage.

The Sunday Telegraph can reveal that Australia’s border boss authorised border clearance for 99 non-citizens.

Last month the government announced any foreigner who had travelled to China would not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left.

The National Security Committee of Cabinet agreed to the ban on February 1 in an attempt to try and stop the spread of the coronavirus.

On Friday the government extended its coronavirus travel ban for another week amid fears a Covid-19 global pandemic will soon be declared

The ban does not apply to Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family as well as aircrews.

The government confirmed that Australia’s Border Force Commissioner has used his discretionary powers on 28 occasions to permit entry to 99 foreigners.

A spokesman from the Department of Home Affairs said the Commissioner only used discretionary powers in “compelling or compassionate circumstances” and where the relevant health authorities support the request.

Diplomats who are residents in Australia and Chinese citizens receiving treatment in Australia or visiting sick loved ones were also among those smuggled in.

Last month Chinese woman Xianglan Ren was also allowed to enter Australia to see her son Li Changxiang before doctors at the Royal Melbourne Hospital turned off his life support."

The first cases of this virus appeared Dec 8-18. Doctors started speculating it might be SARS or something else Dec 30-31. On Jan 1 the market where the virus was thought to have originated from was shut down for cleaning and disinfecting. Jan 9 the first death from the virus occurred and WHO released a statement about a novel coronavirus having been isolated. [During that first week, eight doctors were taken into custody for spreading rumors about the virus](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-information-crackdown-on-wuhan-coronavirus-2020-1). ([2](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/health/virus-corona.html)) This is in the OP article. [Not one article was published in the largest Wuhan newspaper about the virus until Jan 19](https://www.ft.com/content/6996d92a-3ce2-11ea-a01a-bae547046735).

On Jan 23 a lockdown was put in place on Wuhan and other cities in Wubei. For this the WHO piled heaps of praise on Chinese officials for their response, repeatedly, and told the press that the rest of the world ""should be grateful"" to China for the measures they had implemented.

That time between Jan 9 and 23 the following occurred: the gene sequence was identified and given a name, human to human transmission was recorded, over 600 laboratory confirmed cases were recorded, including in Guangdong, Zhejiang, Tainjin, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Guizhou, Fujian, Anhui, Shanxi, Ningxia, Shandong, Hunan, Yunnan, Hainan, Sichuan, Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Macau, Bangkok, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, the United States and Taiwan. There was also the super spreader who infected 14 people in Wuhan and 16 more deaths. [Oh, and on Jan 18 a banquet in Wuhan attended by 40,000 families because they were trying to break a record in their patriotic expression for the regime was allowed to go ahead](https://www.ft.com/content/fa83463a-4737-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441), after it was known that the virus was spreading, and then those people all went on their merry way. That is in the OP article as well.

The virus was already spreading for weeks by the time China did something about it other than censor hashtags. Every single province in China had cases by the time they started locking down cities. [The mayor of Wuhan himself said that the city's response to the outbreak was slowed by government transparency with Chinese characteristics](https://www.newsweek.com/who-praises-china-country-that-deserves-gratitude-respect-some-question-coronavirus-1484716).

>""China is doing the right things, and China is responding in a massive way,"" Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, told reporters on Wednesday. ""We've seen no obvious lack of transparency.""

Imagine if there had been an outbreak like this in Switzerland. And in the weeks it took for Swiss officials to identify that there was a problem and start enforcing travel restrictions, the virus spread to every single other country in Europe. That's what happened in China, and people who love China want to praise China for their response.

As the OP points out in great detail, PRC wasn't nearly as interested in preventing the spread of this virus in the critical early stages as they were in controlling the message. For that we are all paying the price now."

2020-02-29,TheKmank,worldnews,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/f7xl2l/live_thread_coronavirus_outbreak/fj3gqn7/,"Guess I better post my copy again:

The people saying that the seasonal flu is more deadly than COVID-19 are falsely equivocating the scope of both viruses. Whilst it is true that Influenza in 2019 to 2020 will kill an estimated 41,000 people in the USA alone (currently much higher than the less than 3,000 reported deaths worldwide for COVID-19), it is also important to remember that the seasonal flu infects an estimated 41,000,000 people a year in the USA (source: [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm)). That means that 1 in every 1,000 people who get the seasonal flu die ie. 0.1% of people.

COVID-19 on the other hand has an estimated fatality rate of 1 in every 100 people (and that is a low estimate). The COVID-19 virus is highly contagious and is rapidly spreading throughout the globe. If COVID-19 became as widespread in the USA as Influenza the numbers of death would be quite different. If the same 41,000,000 were infected within the year, the estimated death toll would be 410,000. That’s a death toll almost the size of Minneapolis.

The mortality rate, combined with the virus’ high infection rate is why many people are worried about COVID-19 but there is more to it than that. We have vaccines to help protect vulnerable (old, young, sick, etc) people from Influenza which is decently effective at stopping the virus. We do not, as of yet, have a vaccine to protect these people from COVID-19 and we probably wont have one for 12 to 18 months at best (source: [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-22/coronavirus-vaccine-animal-testing-days-away-uq-researchers/11991456](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-22/coronavirus-vaccine-animal-testing-days-away-uq-researchers/11991456)).  
 

This is why there needs to be a strong and rapid response to the COVID-19 outbreak and why it should be taken very seriously. If the COVID-19 virus is allowed to run rampant on a global scale it will be devastating.

I haven’t even mentioned the re-infection rate of the disease, the potentially long incubation period or the asymptomatic carriers of the virus.

Does that mean you should go full panic mode? Probably not. As of right now, the best thing you can do is to keep updated and informed. Know the ways to lower the risk of infection and take the threat seriously (see: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)).

The death toll might not be as big as Influenza right now but make no mistake, COVID-19 has the potential to be a much greater threat to the world."

>

The Trump Administration has literally flown infected (and likely infected) people into and around the US on commercial flights increasing the likelihood of a full blown outbreak. 

>He's set billions specifically towards fighting it. 
>

He cut the CDC (and other) teams that are meant to proactively catch and prevent these situations, making it much harder to respond. Also the funds he's proposing are cutting back from other essential areas rather than working with Congress for appropriate appropriations. 

>We've had exceptionally low numbers of cases due to travel bans and screenings he's instituted
>

This is more likely due to the minimal testing happening at present since there has actually been very little with respect to border management for this... see above with the HHS flights scandal for instance. The CDC is still requiring samples to be sent to their Atlanta site with a 3 day turnaround, rather than permitting labs local to areas to process them and is preventing the purchase of readily available testing kits from the rest of the world. In addition the initial testing kits the CDC developed turned out to be inaccurate. 


>Why do I get the sense that he could personally create a vaccine and still be criticized for it?

A vaccine is, at minimum with favouring winds, at least a year away... there's other things that need to be done right now."

WHO Director General Dr. Tedros said that most cases can still be traced to known contacts or clusters of cases adding that there are no evidence as yet that the virus is spreading freely in communities.
He also informed that work is also progressing on vaccines and therapeutics. More than 20 vaccines are in development globally, and several therapeutics are in clinical trials. He expected the first results of these trials in a few weeks.
Menawhile, South Korea has reported on Saturday its biggest surge in new COVID-19 cases with 594 new cases confirmed on Friday. The increase brings the total number of infections in South Korea to 2,931, according to the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
Seventeen people have died in the country so far. South Korea has the highest number of confirmed cases outside China where the outbreak started. Concerns have also grown of a possible epidemic in the United States with the reports of a number of new cases without any known source of infection.
The virus has rapidly spread across the world over the past week, causing stock markets to sink to their lowest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis over fears that the disease could wreak havoc on the world economy. More than 2,900 people have died and over 85,000 have been infected in more than 45 countries since it emergence in December last year.
Meanwhile Bahrain today threatened legal prosecution against travelers who came from Iran and hadn't been tested for the new coronavirus, and also barred public gatherings for two weeks as confirmed cases across the wider Mideast grew to over 520.
Â  Bahrain has been hard-hit with cases and shut down flights to halt the spread of the virus, which causes the illness named COVID-19 by experts. All of Bahrain's cases link back to Iran, whose death toll of 34 killed is the worst outside of China, the epicenter of the virus.
Saudi Arabia announced today it would bar citizens of the Gulf Cooperation Council from Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina over concerns about the virus' spread. The GCC is a six-nation group including Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Saudi Arabia had earlier closed off the holy sites to foreign pilgrims over the coronavirus, affecting plans later this year for millions, ahead of the fasting month of Ramadan and the annual hajj pilgrimage."

2020-02-29,madali0,ProIran,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProIran/comments/fakfz2/iran_parliament_elections_megathread/fj3dmf4/,"Some of the stuff from the neolibs on r/  Iran 2.0

&#x200B;

>7,000 potential candidates have been disqualified,

Not every single person from that list is disqualified from being too cool for the akhunds. Majority are disqualified for not having minimum requirements, not providing the correct documents, or really just messing up the forms. 16,145 people wrote down their names for this election. For example, the minimum age is 30, so if a 25 year old enters, he will be disqualified.

>most of them reformists allied with Rouhani. 

This statement can't be made with any real proof regarding the 7000. Firstly, because like I said, we don't know if they were disqualified for their not having the basic qualifications, or not. Secondly, due to the Reformists being in power, their disqualification will make a lot more media noise than some independent guy from a small town. For example, one of the loudest noise that was made, out of that 7000, Kambiz Mehdizadeh. 

The son-in-law of President Rouhani.

I don't think the rest of the 6999 had an Iranian President for a father in law, so they couldn't make as much noise as the poor oppressed reformists being barred. 

&#x200B;

>This includes 90 sitting members of the 290-seat Parliament who had wanted to run for re-election.  

Firstly, the number is 75, since some of those were re-evaluated and were allowed. But I doubt they are really update on Majlis news anyway, so why would they know.

I don't understand. Certain neo-libs spend all year complaining about the politicians in Iran, and when they get barred, they worry about them?

It's hard to get the exact side they belong to, and that's mainly because Iran political parties are very fluid, and not obvious like the two party system of USA. For example, the most famous person disqualified in that list is Ali Motaheri. 

Motaheri is pro-Rouhani (and was strongly anti-Ahmadinejad) but it would be laughable to consider him a ""reformer"" (although, maybe you can,since that word apparently means nothing). Ali Motaheri is the brother of law of Ali Larijani, who was the Majlis Chairman. Ali Larijani this time didn't run for Majlis, and his brother Sadegh Larijani finished his term of Chief of Judiciary last year. 

Also, with his brother in law being chairman, Ali Motaheri was also the Vice-Chairman of the Majlis. 

So shouldn't we celebrate the dismantling of this nepotism, instead of crying for the poor 62 year old elite for not being allowed to run anymore? 

By the way, this ""reformist"", during Ahmedinjad's time once got upset for Ahmedinjad trying to respect Ancient Iran. Ali Motaheri criticized Ahmedinjad for the latter saying that we are the children of Rostam and Esfandiar. 

This is just one example, I give you dozens more, but it would be a huge project. 

For now, here is the list, [go through them and check them out](https://www.mashreghnews.ir/news/1030430/%DA%A9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%86%D9%85%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AF%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%AF%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84). And let's be honest, I doubt any of those neo-libs even know 90% of those names, or have ever even voted for any of them. I have almost never seen them discussing any of the Majlis members, so it's as sincere as Pompeo being upset about the disqualifications. 

Also, there is probably more likelihood of Rouhani allies being disqualified in those 75 members only because the Majlis contained more Rouhani allies in the first place. It's like saying, oh no, most disqualified were men. 

Also also, this means 25% were disqualified, but the people voted out another 117 of the current Majlis members, meaning 70% disqualification by the people. That is, almost twice the number were disqualified by the voters. 

If we keep complaining about the state of majlis and politicians then we really need to shake things up. Enough of 60 year old brother in laws and son in laws. Let's get some fresh blood in. 

&#x200B;

>Conservatives loyal to Khamenei sweep every single parliamentary seat in Tehran.   
>  
>Conservatives expected to sweep the elections nationwide and lead the next parliament. 

On average, there were 25 candidates for every seat. Meaning people had huge choices. 

Regarding the outcome, it should be obvious when the current political group did not provide the outcome they promised, so obviously people will vote differently. I mean, that's basically how it happens in most countries and literally the whole point of democracy. In the last majlis elections, the difference between the two sides weren't that far. Reformists/moderates were 42%, while Principalists were 32%, and 11% being independants. So, given the current economy and the way JCPOA turned out, the winning side will lose favor. Which is what happened.

Although, ""loyal to Khamenei"" is a silly turn of phrase. All the political parties claim they are loyal to Khamenei so I don't know how to distinguish them, the same way they all say they are loyal to Iran or loyal to Islam. These are meaningless claims. There needs to be focus on political policies. 

Regarding the term ""conservatives"", like I always say, that's a stupid term anyway really. Somehow Ali Motaheri, who I mentioned, is less conservative than the current winner, Ghalibaf? And Mir Salim got the second most votes, who is a Principalist in this election, but he is hardly more conservative than certain reformists. I mean, read his wiki, he was part of the Rafsanjani administration, recommended by Bani Sadr to be the Deputy Minister of his administration (but was disapproved by the Majlis).

Here is the fourth person I found with the highest vote. Mohsen Dehnavi, who is 35 years old. He seems to be a Sharif university student with a PHD in Chemistry. 

Here is what I found on him. Mr Dehnavi was to go to work in Boston Children's Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard, as a visiting scholar. Instead he was detained in the airport and sent back.

 [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/11/travel-ban-iran-cancer-reseracher-boston-mohsen-dehnavi](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/11/travel-ban-iran-cancer-reseracher-boston-mohsen-dehnavi) 

That guy is now going to represent us in Majlis, instead of a bunch of cleric ""reformists"".

>I've heard <20% turnout in Tehran, so figures. 

Well, like always these guys like to be a little cheeky with the numbers. Tehran's turnout was not great, but it wasn't less than 20%. It was 26%. 

Several things to add here. First of all, coronavirus came up right before the election from the Rouhani government (hmm...) so obviously people would stay away, specially in Tehran, where the concern is higher. Tehran is always lower than the average anyway (why? Maybe because smaller towns feel closer to their Majlis representatives).

And generally, it is not unheard of. In 8th Majlis, [Tehran turnout was 31%](https://www.mashreghnews.ir/news/1042990/%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%DA%A9%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%85-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DB%B1%DB%B0-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%AE%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84). Then it went up 48% and 50% and came down again (virus and probably disillusionment with the reformists).

&#x200B;

> This is the biggest failure of an election in the history of the IR. 

I don't know what biggest failure means. Do they mean lowest turnout? Sure, but that doesn't mean much. 

Every country that has more than one election will literally have one that has the lowest turnout in it's history.

> The Parliament with the least public confidence since Shah era. 

I can't touch this statement, because it obviously just came out of an ass, and I don't want to catch coronavirus."

But the news is making it sound like the coronavirus is worse. 
Everyone should go get their flu shot I’m not saying they shouldn’t And I’m not saying that there’s not ad campaigns for everybody to go get their flu shot. As far as us not having a vaccine for the coronavirus if there’s money to be made in it which there is a guarantee you they’re 17 large pharmaceutical companies that are pouring million dollars a day and finding the cure the fastest.
That being said we do have vaccines for the influenza virus yet it’s still killing five times as many people as a virus without a vaccine."

Is there something going on you want to tell me?” I just stare wide-eyed at her, chuckle softly and say, “Nothing’s going on.” I’m not wearing anything fitted, and I have a loose cardigan on over a dress. There’s no hiding it. The same night, in the dark and quickly walking up the stairs towards my floor, a neighbor who’s chilling on her balcony shouts loudly, “Hey, you pregnant?” Uhhhhhh... I really wasn’t ready for this attention yet. The worst part is that we haven’t even told my husband’s parents (his choice) because he wants to tell them in person, but they just got back from their trip in Asia, which left my husband paranoid and wanting to avoid seeing them due to his fear of people who have gone through international airports and the Coronavirus. He said one more weekend, and we’ll visit them to tell the news. I pointed out that I’m VERY visible, even under baggy clothes, and it may be hard to keep people from awkwardly posting something on social media to us if word spreads. Ugh. I knew I’d be happy to see my bump come in, but I just wish we could finally tell his parents so I don’t have to pretend I don’t have this super obvious bump on me with people around me.

 Look, in all seriousness, and as glib as my response was, the main threat isn't the financial effects of this event right now. The main threat is, that the CDC and the other entities normally responsible for fighting pandemic threats, have been savaged by the current administration. There were 47 programs specifically dedicated to dealing with infectious disease control, and of those, 37 have been cut. Also, the man in charge of the pandemic response, is Mike Pence, who, with the greatest possible respect, looks like a Ken Doll that saw too much, and lives in denial about the trauma of his life experiences. Not only that, but he is only second for science denying after the idiot in Chief. 

 These Dow hits will take time to travel out from the economic centre, and be felt, they aren't an immediate threat in the same way that the actual Coronavirus is. This might seem a cold thing to say, but people die faster from Coronavirus than they do starvation. Even if jobs are lost on the back of these hits, it won't be absolutely immediate, and it will take time for folks to run out of money while hunting for other work, meaning that as deep, and as difficult as that problem will be to solve down the road, its not nearly as rapidly destructive as the virus itself is proving to be. 

 The other problem that I see coming down the pipe, is that with everyone so worried about the financial effects, no one is going to be taking a sick day from their jobs, because they are going to want to make sure they get every penny out of their working week even more than usual, as a back stop against future economic trouble caused by the Dow dip (assuming they think that far ahead, or can afford to more like). This is understandable, and some might call it noble. But folks going into work sick, whether its out of fear of losing their job, missing a payday, or fear over the Dow dip, isn't what you want when there is a pandemic threat, and lets be real here, that's what this Coronavirus is shaping up to be. There's some argument afoot as to whether it is right now, but its largely an argument over semantics, language, pedantry. Realistically, this thing is transmitting itself quite handily, rapidly, and IT doesn't seem to care that its not being officially recognised as a pandemic. It kills people anyway, moves rapidly anyway, and its full list of capabilities is not yet known.

 Another issue that is going to be unique to America, among the most developed nations, is that America is the only top nation when it comes to general wealth and modernity, that has a dark ages approach to healthcare, meaning that its citizens are, by default, more likely than those of other top of the food chain nations, to get hit badly by the virus. Virtually every other modern, advanced nation has socialised medicine of some sort, meaning their people are, on average, healthier to one or another degree, than those of the United States. They aren't too scared of bills to get medical help when they need it. That is going to be a big factor. 

 So the concern I have, is not about the stock market. Its actually about the virus itself, the response to it in one of the worlds richest, and most powerful countries. I think its going to be a massacre on the biological front, if that virus gets a hold of citizens from the lower end of the socio-economic ladder, because those folks cannot afford medical treatment, but can't afford not to at least try to work while they are sick also. That's incredibly dangerous as a mixture. A rapidly moving virus, people who cannot afford to be healthy, and cannot afford to stop working... 

 Powder keg. Its not the economic effects of this virus that matter right now. Its the immediate threat to human lives, and the human cost of a basically demolished CDC that concerns me."

I am not a small business owner myself, however I used to work in banking where I would see 100s of businesses with earnings of €20-100m. Granted these companies are not large multinational corporations, they are still large relative to a small business owner like yourself. 

Even these companies had very little oversight of their supply chains. The global economy has never truly recovered since the 2008 financial crisis and there has been pressure from management to cut costs wherever possible. This means opting for the cheapest supplier without consideration of the transparency of the supply chain. Management is typically not interested in contingency planning through dual or triple sourcing key components as it takes time and constrains already limited resources. Heck, even the large car manufacturers are talking about shutting down manufacturing plants as a result of this. Everyone is vulnerable. 

The good thing is that these supply chain disruptions will be affecting not just yourself but the entire industry. 

On the other hand, this will inevitably be a challenging time for your business and will require prudent cash flow management. I'd postpone any non-essential investments and maintain a strong relationship with the distributors you use to understand where they source their components from and what the alternatives are. I'd also consider making the most of the remaining components you use that may be difficult to source in the coming months, for example by charging a premium for the products you are manufacture"

Is the virus infections during the incubation period?

Available facts show that the new coronavirus infects when the patient is ill and in connection with the illness. The knowledge and experience we have right now also shows that people do not become infected during the incubation period, that is, the time span between the time of infection and when the disease breaks out. However, those who have been exposed to infection should be aware of early signs of illness.

We base our position on, among other things, the following:

There are solid scientific studies and a scientific evaluation on the coronavirus that causes the disease sars, which spread throughout the world in spring 2003. Evaluations from that outbreak clearly show that the sars-coronavirus does not infect at all during the incubation period. Among all known viral diseases, it is very uncommon to be infected during the incubation period. However, many viruses are infected when the disease breaks out. There is therefore much evidence of a similar course of events even for the new coronavirus covid-19.

Many export cases of the ongoing covid-19 outbreak from China have now been identified. Among these cases, there are no confirmed descriptions of infection spread during the incubation period.

Knowledge about the new corona virus is added every day and we follow the knowledge situation closely. If new facts emerge that give us reasons to change our assessments, we will communicate this. The Public Health Authority cooperates closely with the WHO on these issues."

I am very concerned not so much for myself, but because my 70 year old father is immuno-suppressed due to medication for a kidney transplant.  I did a little research and purchased some more monolaurin, it is a potent natural antiviral (and antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparisitic.)  I also have some n-acetylcysteine to function as a mucolytic to help him clear his lungs should he get infected (guaifenesin is more effective, but not safe for him to take.)

I'm curious to see what others recommend."

Ma che cazzo di ragionamento ha la gente??? Prima di tutto c'è bisogno di trasparenza e chiarezza, il coronavirus è altamente contagioso ed è indubbiamente peggio di un influenza, pur avendo una mortalità bassa questo non vuol dire che non sia grave o da sottovalutare, bisogna tutelare tutti i cittadini di tutte le età, quindi bisognava arginare meglio il fenomeno, se fosse stato preso seriamente fin dall inizio ora non sarebbe tutto bloccato, proprio perché il virus è praticamente sconosciuto e i soggetti possono essere asintomatici bisognava fare altro rispetto alla semplice misurazione della temperatura, ora i casi si stanno moltiplicando di giorno in giorno e si stanno cagando su perché difficilmente sapranno contenerlo e una volta fuori controllo sarà un bel guaio quindi si stanno gia parando il culo da adesso. 
E comunque che uccide solo i vecchi è una gran cazzata, infatti il famoso medico cinese che è morto a causa del  coronavirus che aveva denunciato per primo non mi pare fosse anziano, e chissà quanti altri.

 In an era where reimbursements from Medicare and private insurance companies is constantly declining, we live on a razor edge of hospitals being nearly 100% capacity all the time. They have to in order to survive financially. 

In the last week, our ICU has been constantly full. If someone needs admitted in the middle of the night, we are scrambling trying to figure out who is well enough to move to progressive care unit at 3AM and then of course someone needs bumped from progressive to a regular med bed. Patients are staying for hours on a ventilator in the ED trauma bays while we wait for a room in ICU to open up. Many times this week, we have transferred to other hospitals (praying 1 of the 6 hospitals nearby has an ICU bed open) after stabilizing in the ED because we have no beds. 

Most people don't even realize this is a common occurrence all over the US (throughout the year but particularly during the months of flu season). If we had a coronavirus outbreak, we would have essentially no space, no ventilators, no negative pressure isolation rooms for them. It's a terrifying thought."

In numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the U.S. government, the only consistent response I encountered was distressed confusion.

Aber nicht jetzt, sondern vor ca. 2-3 Wochen, als die Meldungen zum Corona-Virus begannen. 

Es gibt ein altes Sprichtwort: ""Der beste Zeitpunkt, um einen Baum zu pflanzen, war vor 20 Jahren. Der zweitbeste Zeitpunkt war gestern. Der drittbeste ist jetzt."" Ich versuche allgemein zu überlegen: ""Was kann ich heute tun, um mein morgiges Ich zu unterstützen?"" Das sind meistens kleine Dinge: Den Arbeitsrucksack am Vorabend packen, die Kleidung für den nächsten Tag schon mal rauslegen und kontrollieren, dass alles ordentlich ist; das Mittagessen vorkochen oder eine Monatskarte rechtzeitig bestellen. Wenn ich heute etwas machen kann, was mir morgen Stress erspart oder den Tag angenehmer macht, versuche ich, das zu tun. 

Es sei gesagt, dass ich niemand bin, der typischerweise hamstert. Schweinegrippe und Vogelgrippe haben mich z.B. kalt gelassen. Ich evaluiere Situationen immer anhand der mir zur Verfügung stehenden Informationen. Und in den letzten Wochen habe ich, über verschiedene Quellen die folgenden Informationen erhalten:

* China riegelt mehrere Städte ab
* China erweitert ohne Probleme die Erlaubnis, dass sich Chinesen im Ausland aufhalten dürfen (im mir bekannten Fall wurde die Aufenthaltserlaubnis – normal sind 3 Monate – bis August verlängert; das ist bis dato nie vorgekommen!)
* China baut innerhalb von Tagen Krankenhäuser
* im Durchschnitt steckt ein Infizierter 4 andere Menschen an
* seit Monaten kommt es in Deutschland zu Lieferengpässen bei Medikamenten (Deutsches Ärzteblatt)
* noch Anfang Februar erklärte die Bundesregierung die Gefahr durch das Virus sei gering und man sei für eine Epidemie gewappnet (Tagesschau 3.2.20)

Die Angaben, ""die Gefahr des Corona-Virus sei gering"", ließ sich nach meiner Einschätzung logisch nicht mit den mir zur Verfügung stehenden sonstigen Informationen vereinbaren. Auch, dass Deutschland auf eine Epidemie gut vorbereitet sei, halte ich hinsichtlich des Arzneimittelengapsses für fraglich. Es ist auch bekannt, dass Krankenhäuser, Ärzte und Pflegepersonal oft schon jetzt überlastet sind. Wenn also auf einmal ein Gros der Deutschen ins Krankenhaus ""muss"", können dafür logisch keine annähernd ausreichenden Kapazitäten bestehen. 

Ich habe also schließlich eine Risiko-Abwägung getroffen. Ich habe mich gefragt: 

* Ist es nicht völlig unwahrscheinlich, dass ich von dem Coronavirus betroffen bin? (Aufgrund der Vernetzung war es nur eine Frage der Zeit, bis das Virus auch nach Deutschland kommt.)
* Was kostet es mich, wenn ich mir gängige Mittel kaufe, die mir helfen, wenn ich eine Grippe/Erkältung (welchen Typs auch immer!) einfange? Ergebnis: ca. 75€. 
* Wie viele Dinge davon verbrauche ich im normalen Alltag, wenn ich keine Grippe bekommen sollte? Ergebnis: ca. 90% (alles bis auf Halstabletten und Hustensaft). Es sind also keine ""Extrakosten"", sondern nur Kosten, die vor der eigentlichen Fälligkeit anfallen. 

Auf meiner Einkaufsliste standen:
diverse Desinfektionsmittel, Ibuprofen/Paracetamol, Arnikaöl, Erkältungsbad, Hustensaft, Halstabletten, Vitamintabletten, Taschentücher, Toilettenpapier, Heiße Zitrone, Tee, Honig, Ingwer, Brühwürfel, Eier, Suppengemüse , Suppennudeln, Fleisch, Cola (=Koffein für den Kreislauf), Saft, Puddingpulver, Dosenobst (=Dinge, die angenehm essbar sind, wenn der Hals wehtut).  

Vorräte wie Nudeln, Reis, Bohnen, Konserven, Hygieneprodukte (Seife, Zahnpasta etc.) & Co habe ich eh immer genug. Wer jetzt aber festgestellt hat, dass er nichts dergleichen in annähernd ausreichender Menge zuhause hat, wird eventuell bei seiner Risikoabwägung dazu gekommen sein, dass es nicht schadet, vielleicht das ein oder andere extra mitzunehmen. Und auch ""Kleinvieh macht Mist"": wenn also 100 Leute auf die Idee kommen, nur eine extra Konserve zu kaufen, fällt das im Supermarkt-Regal auf. Wenn 100 Leute je 10 Konserven kaufen, fällt das massiv auf. Und ich behaupte, es kaufen mehr als 100 Leute am Tag ein. ;)"

South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Sunday raised the country's virus to the highest 'red' level, in a bid to strengthen the government response to the spiralling outbreak.

I think it's the right choice because China cutting us off and not cooperating is a far worse scenario but it doesn't mean that we should take their data at face value. 

Reported new infections are down. I'll admit that I'm impressed by the lockdown measures implemented but they've changed the testing criteria several times and the number of cases outside of Hubei province is far too low to be accurate. I suspect its being downplayed in an attempt to get people back to work. I guess we'll see the truth come out over the next few weeks but I think it's naive to assume they're telling the truth. Given China's past, skepticism is the way to go. 

[Here's an article on reinfected patients](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-reinfection-explainer-idUSKCN20M124).

The number tested is key because it sets an upper bound on the total number of cases/is a sign of the CDC not doing their job. The US has a population of 350+ million and people fly in every day from around the world including China, Korea, Iran and Italy. 400 tests is not sufficient. Apparently patients are being charged 1800-3500 usd to get tested for the virus, that's insane and no wonder people aren't going to get checked. 

[An article on the CDC sending bad test kits] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/25/cdc-coronavirus-test/). 

The Pence pick may not be the worst I guess but I'd rather it be someone with a medical background especially since they seem to be not letting [experts talk to the public](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-anthony-fauci-trump-admin-stops-discussion-2020-2). 

This will be a serious pandemic, there is no containing this. Its already in too many countries, many of which don't have the resources to contain this. Even if say the US and Europe manages to do a good job of containing it, how about Iran and the Middle East, South East Asia? 

The flu is a bigger threat in the US currently yes but this is an extremely infectious disease, its actually more infectious than the flu. [The R0 value is estimated to be 2.2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316). The flu has a R0 of 1.3. Preliminary numbers yes but it's more dangerous than the flu, especially since the death rate is at least 20x higher.

It is a fascinating topic but downplaying it and thinking you won't get it is the wrong approach to have. Sorry if I was a bit aggressive in the phrasing but my girlfriend is an anesthetist at a hospital with several coronavirus patients already and its incredibly frustrating when we are trying to convince friends and family to take this seriously and even now a few of them still don't."

I have always said that teachers shouldn't expect to trade on an unrelated Bachelor's degree and an online TEFL certificate forever. However, I think teachers should invest in professional development for the *right* reasons, that is, to develop professionally, as opposed to netting a higher salary.

That said, for a teacher to get anything out of further qualifications, they should probably have some solid experience behind them; you *need* a minimum of two years' relevant experience to be accepted onto a Delta or DipTESOL course. What are new/inexperienced teachers supposed to do?

As someone else has already said, in the case of the Coronavirus, it's not further qualifications that you need but rather a solid emergency fund that will get you out/home in the event of things going wrong.

Furthermore, new teachers due to start after the two-week (unpaid) Tet holiday have had their start dates pushed back again and again. Then there are the teachers who went to Vietnam for Chinese New Year and got stuck there, unable to return to China, and fast running out of money. A little bit of empathy wouldn't hurt. 

> ...those who are in the better school jobs are being paid to essentially have an extended holiday.

It's worth noting that even if a ""good"" employer is paying people to sit at home right now, they won't continue to do so indefinitely.

> The transition can be hard, but getting your foot in ANY door of an international school can be good.

No-one is disputing the fact that being a qualified/licenced teacher in your home country is the way to landing better jobs and earning more money. But what so many EFL-teachers-turned-subject-teachers fail to understand is that not everyone *wants* to teach kids for all eternity - I certainly don't. 

It's frustrating that this is consistently the ONLY advice given to teachers wanting to progress, as though EFL teaching is only a stepping stone to ""something better"". EFL teaching is a career in its own right, and should be seen as such."

I'm genuinely curious why think this is the case. I'm interested in hearing your reasoning. Happy to share my reasoning as well and engage in a productive bipartisan discussion, if you're willing. Here goes:

I follow this closely, and I've notice Trump has spent very little public time focusing on ensuring Americans are informed and prepared to deal with what could be significant disruption and possibly a deadly health crisis. His comments on the virus always come back to how everything bad happening in the wake of the virus is, unsurprisingly, the fault of his enemies — Democrats and the media.

He seems to devote much more energy to downplaying the impact of the virus and blaming Democrats/media for things like the falling stock market and people's fears about the virus. He’s even dangerously contradicted his administration's health experts' warnings and calls for preparation. Trump has spread dangerous misinformation about the virus to downplay its threat because he’s seemingly worried that acknowledging and addressing those concerns could harm his preferred public narrative (That the country is thriving economically and otherwise -- and therefore should re-elect him.)

In short: Everything I've seen from Trump continually illustrates that his top concern with the coronavirus is protecting himself and his re-election from the impact of the virus. Sure, he’d love to protect the American people from the virus too — but only if that didn’t conflict with his efforts to project a narrative helpful to his re-election.

If he has to downplay the seriousness of the virus and spread misinformation in ways that put more people at risk in order to continue propping up his preferred re-election narrative, then so be it. That’s exactly what he has been doing.

When it comes to a choice between protecting himself personally or the American people generally, does anyone really think Trump ever has - or would - choose the second option?

Again - genuinely want to see what you think and what I might be missing here."

It's so everyone is on the same page with the public.

Vice President Mike Pence created a firestorm after he informed agency officials that all messaging related to the coronavirus must be filtered through his office, but a senior Trump administration official said on Friday that was only a temporary pause to ensure proper coordination. Pence’s policy led to some career experts canceling television appearances, though they have told lawmakers the administration is not silencing them. 
“We want open, clear, rapid, fast, transparent communication,” the senior administration official said, pointing to a Friday press briefing with White House officials and Health and Human Services Department Secretary Alex Azar, and other media events. “[Pence] is just trying to make sure they’re not unintentionally scaring the American public by having people on at every hour of every single cable network, and saying different things each hour.”

I have the coronavirus. And it hasn’t been that bad.
I am in my late 60s, and the sickest I’ve ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out on my back for a few days. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don’t have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual.
I caught the virus on the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for 14 days, at the end of a 16-day cruise I took with my wife, Jeri. When I left the ship a couple of weeks ago, I felt fine. We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine. Jeri and I got a swab test for the virus. Our temperatures were normal; they’d get the swab results back in 48 hours. Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport, where two U.S. government planes waited for us.
As we took off from Tokyo, I had a bit of a cough, but I chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin. I felt pretty tired — but who wouldn’t, in our situation? I dozed off.
When I woke up, I had a fever. I made my way to the back of the cargo plane, where the Air Force had set up a quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic. They took my temperature. It was over 103 degrees. So I took a seat in the quarantine area and fell back asleep until we touched down in California, at Travis Air Force Base.Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came onto the plane and said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha (with our spouses, if they wanted to come along). The CDC had a quarantine location at the University of Nebraska’s hospital. We arrived on Feb. 17, greeted by a fleet of ambulances and police cars. Officials put me on a stretcher and wheeled me into a van, which made for a very dramatic scene. I easily could have walked myself, despite my exhaustion.On the hospital campus, they put me in a biocontainment unit. The space was sealed off, with two double-paned windows that looked out on the hallway, and a large, heavy, insulated door. Two cameras watched me at all times; a set of computer monitors were equipped with microphones, so that the medical staff and I could communicate with CDC officials at central command down the hall. The room had last been used for the Ebola outbreak in 2014.While there is no vaccine for coronavirus, preventive steps and awareness are the best tools to prepare and protect yourself in the event of an outbreak.  A doctor and nurses reviewed my case with me and took a bunch of lab tests. They wore heavy-duty hazmat suits sealed with duct tape and equipped with motors that helped with air circulation. It looked like something out of “The Andromeda Strain.” When the test came back a few hours later, I wasn’t surprised to learn that I had the coronavirus. Later, the Tokyo swab confirmed the result — I had caught the virus even before I left the ship.
It didn’t scare me too badly. I knew my number was up. The way I saw it, I was going to get stuck in at least 14 more days of quarantine, even if I didn’t get the virus. So many fellow passengers had come down with the illness, including one of my friends, that I’d gotten somewhat used to the idea that I might catch it, too. My wife, however, tested negative and headed to quarantine at a separate facility a few blocks away. After those days being cooped up on the ship together, I think we both relished the alone time; we still could communicate through our phones.
During the first few days, the hospital staff hooked me up to an IV, mostly as a precaution, and used it to administer magnesium and potassium, just to make sure I had plenty of vitamins. Other than that, my treatment has consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade — and, when my fever rose just above 100 degrees, some ibuprofen. The nurses came to the room every four hours or so, to check my vitals, ask if I needed anything and to draw my blood. I got very good at unhooking all the monitors checking my oxygen level, blood pressure and heart rate so I could go to the bathroom or just pace around the room a little, to get my blood flowing. I never quite got the hang of hooking them back up without making a tangled mess. After 10 days, I moved out of biocontainment and into the same facility as Jeri. Now we can videochat from our separate quarantines, in neighboring rooms.As of my most recent test, on Thursday, I am still testing positive for the virus. But by now, I don’t require much medical care. The nurses check my temperature twice a day and draw my blood, because I’ve agreed to participate in a clinical study to try to find a treatment for coronavirus. If I test negative three days in a row, then I get to leave.
The time has passed more quickly than I would’ve expected. With my laptop, I get as much work done as I can, remotely. I catch up with friends. I take walks around my room, trying to take a thousand more steps each day. I also watch the news. It’s surreal to see everyone panic — news conferences, the stock market falling, school closures — about a disease I have. It does seem likely that coronavirus will spread in the United States, but it won’t help anybody if we all panic. It’s true that the disease seems much more likely to be fatal for older people and those in poor health. I’m relatively fortunate: I’m still younger than the most at-risk groups, and I’m in good shape, giving me less cause for alarm. Others who contract the virus won’t be as lucky. At least six Diamond Princess passengers have died from the disease, of around 705 passengers who caught it.Still, coronavirus doesn’t have to be a horrible calamity. Based on my experience, I’d recommend that everyone get a good digital thermometer, just as a comfort tool, so they can reassure themselves if their noses start running.
If you told me when I left home in January that I wouldn’t be back until March — that, instead, I would be confined for more than 24 days because I’d catch a novel virus at the center of what could become a pandemic — that would have completely freaked me out. But now that it’s happening, I’m just taking it one day at a time.As told to Post editor Sophia Nguyen."

It's not unusual for something to work in a Petri dish but then do nothing in the body or even be very deadly even after successful animal tests (see what [Theralizumab ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theralizumab) did in the **first human clinical trails!!**).

I'd be surprised in Chloroquine could treat Coronavirus.  At least it's a known quantity for humans: it's pretty toxic for your liver so you don't want take it except for legit medically approved reasons, namely malaria.  

**And the types of malaria now found in SE Asia and Africa are often Chloroquine-resistant anyway!**. That's why it's not as common to find now.

The best treatments for Coronavirus are already know: known anti-virals!  And supportive care if you get severe pneumonia (i.e. respirators).

The other factor: Wuhan Coronavirus is ethnically selective in its infectivity and severity!  The infectivity and severity depend on the allele (particular mutational variant) of a particular cell surface protein called ACE2 that you have.   And the allele depends on your ethnicity.

If you are Asia (especially Chinese, Korean or Japanese), sorry but it sucks to be you because you most likely have the sensitive allele with the strongest infectivity.  If you are Northern European, it turns out your allele of the surface protein ACE2 is the least effective for that.  

Notice the ethnicity of those who are dying **outside of Asia**: mostly all Asians.  There's a reason.  Again: very tragic but it's the genetics and happenstance of Wuhan Coronavirus."

And no it's not like a huge cultural part of the country, maybe like 5% of the population are Asian immigrants  (mostly Chinese and Vietnamese) but the past 2 years I started to recognise we're being more culturally (and other ways too) receptive hence Hungary being a mostly conservative country. Gotta say, I live and spend most of my time in the capital, so I can't talk for the smaller cities, but Budapest is sure becoming a huge fan of Vietnamese cuisine, everyone's all about Pho and Padthai. (also im still not sure where Padthai is from?) Not to talk about the mini asian stores where you can get almost everything for a mite
Sadly, these past 2 months because of the coronavirus these people probably experience racism and other negative effects, they even have  put little notes on the entrances of these Asian stores, saying they're Vietnamese not Chinese.

The fact that Trump has zero credibility or leadership, and would be entirely incapable of providing a comforting response that would make people feel confident is a reality as well.

 They were sure that this was all only because I hate Trump. That I *wished* the economy would crater -- instead of simply saw the evidence in front of my eyes.

2020-02-29,5kyLegend,FCInterMilan,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/fbceja/inters_ceo_giuseppe_marottas_words_regarding/fj3mpp1/,"I'm going to try and explain, trying to balance being brief and being specific enough to make it understandable.

With the Coronavirus outbreak, playing matches should be done with closed doors (like we did on Thursday with Ludogorets), because the big danger is that with 50k+ people attending, one infected person suddenly creates a disaster, getting hundreds or thousands more to also get sick. Juve - Inter (in their stadium) was decided to be played with closed doors. Now, Juve was going to make at least €3M from tickets, which they would have had to refund in case of closed doors. And Agnelli (the mafioso president of Juve) obviously wasn't going to have that. At first, Gazzetta dello Sport (so their credibility isn't the best) reported Juve wasn't going to be refunding those tickets.

Codacons (the customer protection group in Italy, basically) obviously responded by saying that, in case of closed doors, Juve would have had to pay back the tickets, otherwise they would have went through legal ways to have them do that. That's when the ""Agnelli pushing"" began, and rumors of the match being allowed with open doors on Monday instead started circulating. But no, it ended up in nothing, and the match was decided to be played with closed doors on Sunday.

***EVERYONE*** was ok with the ""closed doors decision"" but Agnelli. Juve just reported €50M in losses last week, after all, those millions matter. Plus, they ARE playing at home, so on the field having your fans cheer on Juve and boo Inter was also going to help. But again, for this last point Juve was the ONLY team not ok with losing this advantage. So, suddenly, one day before the match and with Serie A not notifying ANYONE beforehand, the announcement comes out: the match is going to be delayed.

Now, why is this upsetting? For multiple reasons. It screws **us** up, we'd have the most difficult matches in only a few days in May, all in a row. It makes the ""rotating players"" we did with Ludogorets useless, since it was done to rest players for this weekend's match. We already had one delayed match (the Sampdoria one), so ***IF*** we get in both Coppa Italia and Europa League finals, we'd literally have no days for that match, an unprecedented case in Italy.

Plus, the decision itself makes no sense: teams in Serie B in dangerous areas will still play, and the Coppa Italia match Juve - Milan will ***STILL*** be played, but only supporters from Piemonte will be allowed to attend, giving Milan no supporters despite Piemonte also having almost 50 people at risk of being infected. ***ALSO***, the virus isn't going to disappear in one week. Next week we'll be doing this again, so deciding to play next week at closed doors instead of delaying again (something basically impossible to do, given schedules) would show Serie A did this unquestionably to favor Juve.

***tl;dr***: Juve were the only team not ok with closed doors, and yet Serie A decided to postpone the match, royally screwing us over while doing so given our schedule."

Because of how mobile Italy is as a country it's probably a public health issue to have **any** games being played with fans. However, Piemonte is one of the regions in Italy where there are confirmed to be coronavirus cases, and if I'm not mistaken it's the second most cases after Lombardy (Milan).

So the first issue is why are they playing this match with fans? They should consider every match to be a public health risk and so every single game should be played behind closed doors or postponed, whichever they prefer as long as it's consistent

The second issue is why are this match specifically being played with fans? It's in an area with confirmed cases, so why is the FIGC allowing this at all? The FIGC is allowed to force teams to play behind closed doors, and a public health concern is a very good reason to force it if they aren't willing to postpone the match

The third issue is why are they only letting in people from Piemonte? People in Piemonte are already likely to have it, and the only others who will come are from Lombardy where they are in the same position. So if you're going to go ahead and have the game be open to the public, why are you excluding one group when there's nothing separating them as far as the virus goes?

I gotta be honest, I doubt that this is something happening because it's Juve. I really don't think that it's some politician using his position and this very specific situation to benefit Juve. However, that doesn't mean it's not stupid all around. There's no logic to any of it and it's just another thing that benefits Juve - only their fans, Milan screwed over in first leg so missing several starters, and Juve getting the weekend off to rest and prepare for the game. It's the perfect storm to get Milan knocked out and it's just really frustrating."

They lied in order to cover the identities of their believers. Many of them are still out or reach or refusing to be tested. This is one of the reasons why the infection is out of control. The problem is that many Shincheonji people lie to their family, coworkers and friends and they don’t want their lies to be exposed. On top of that, they are convinced that God will protect them if they keep going around evangelizing. Meanwhile people die. 
Shincheonji people believe that they are persecuted because of their beliefs. Actually nobody cares about that. The thing is that they have their own rules that clash with the common social rules. If you are in Shincheonji it is ok to lie, to hide your identity, even to lie to the authorities if you do that in favor of the organization. Well, this creates a huge fracture in the society. I am increasingly worried for the safety of Shincheonji believers. People can not tolerate any longer."

If you hate beans and rice, don't buy it because there's a good chance you won't need your stockpile and now you've just wasted money on food you'll never eat. So, buy what you would normally eat and rotate items out of your stockpile as time goes on. Just make sure your replace what you take from the stockpile. Here's a rough list of items you should think about buying (I won't include amounts as that depends on how many people you're feeding and how many calories you need. Plan on spending $300-400 USD when all is said and done)

&#x200B;

* Canned vegetables (corn, carrots, green beans, beets, peas, baked beans etc.)
* Tomato sauce
* Spam
* Meals (spaghettios, soups, etc.)
* Canned tuna/chicken
* Canned fruits
* Ramen noodles
* Dried potatoes
* Dry white rice
* Dry beans
* Olive oil
* Cereal and oats
* Popcorn
* Granola bars
* Boxed macaroni and cheese meals (Kraft, hamburger helper, etc.)
* Coffee/tea if you drink it
* Crackers/chips/cookies
* Pasta
* Raisins/dried fruits
* Jams/Jellies
* Peanut butter/Nutella
* Honey
* Iodized salt, black pepper, and any seasonings you normally use
* Salsa
* Nuts (Peanuts, cashews, pistachios, almonds)
* Meats (ground beef can be placed in Ziploc bags and pressed flat for easier storage in freezer, otherwise chicken breast, pork chops, ground turkey just make sure everything goes in the freezer)
* Cheese (shredded, sliced, string cheese, cream cheese)
* Shelf stable milk (canned, boxed, almond milk, soy milk)
* Bottled or distilled water (water will likely stay on during an emergency, but in the absence of running water you'll need 1 gallon per person per day)
* Toilet paper, toothpaste, shampoo, and any other toiletries you're running low on just stock up.
* Medications (prescription, painkillers like Tylenol and Motrin, Benadryl, Pedialyte, Antidiarrheal medication like Pepto Bismol or Imodium)
* Multivitamins as you're likely to be missing important nutrients that won't be provided by emergency food
* Hydrogren peroxide for disinfectant purposes
* Isopropyl alcohol
* First aid kit
* Latex or nitrile gloves, N95+ face masks if you can find them, and goggles (the virus can enter through the eyes so if you need to go out goggles will protect you when coupled with a face mask)

This list doesn't include everything you might possibly need and you may not even need some of the items listed, but you now have an idea of what to get. You don't need to buy everything all in one go and can just buy some of the list each time you go grocery shopping. You likely won't need to use any of it due to an emergency, but it's better to prepare now when the stores are stocked vs. later when the shelves are empty. 

Don't tell anyone that you've prepared as most people aren't bothering to prepare for a 3 day emergency let alone a month. Anyone you tell will know you're stocked, and in a worst case scenario where society collapses, you'll be the first to get robbed. I don't think we will get to that point, but I can definitely see some people self-quarantining to avoid the virus if things get bad enough, especially if you're able to work from home. Just get your groceries and relax knowing that you're more prepared than 99% of the population and you've done all you can. Chill out, play some video games, read a book, and don't spend too much time reading about coronavirus, especially on here it can warp your sense of reality if you obsess too much."

I know that feeling; frankly I feel shit knowing that the world is boiled down to essentially, ""Me over everyone else!"", be it hoarding supplies (see: coronavirus outbreak in Singapore, South Korea and now Japan), or this shit storm in Malaysia currently.

Trying to think of good solutions & listening to podcasts like TED Radio Hour to think of ways to make the world less suck.

Frankly, **everyone sucked big time**.

I no longer understood the meaning of the power of the vote; my family uprooted from Singapore in 2010 & I missed two General Elections because my address is no longer based in the island republic. So whatever ""voice"" I make, either in Singapore or in Malaysia, makes ""no difference whatsoever"" because either my name is on a blacklist (I can't vote any more now *unless I made an appeal to the Elections Department in Singapore with surety*) or I'm not a citizen (although I paid taxes).

So frankly speaking I am as pissed as you are with both my purpose of existing (I have fleeting thoughts of standing on the opposite flow of traffic) & at the state of the world.

But where social activism is concerned, I have tried my hand in soup kitchens, lots of Syed Azmi's charity works, and participate in alternative events. I know that it's very little work, but either I sit at my rental home screaming on Twitter or Facebook (I've deleted my account on the latter since 2019) about the unfair state of the world, or I actively seek out social activities to make myself feel less shitty, and happier that I'm sharing my time with like-minded groups of friends.

My time living in KL from 2011 - 2018 was both bittersweet and cheerful. Since my last razor blade incident, however, I returned to my family home in JB to recuperate my mental health. and to orientate myself towards getting the fuck out of Southeast Asia pronto. Hence, I am saving money by working in Singapore to get the fuck out of here.

Nowadays, on Reddit, I subscribed to r/stoicism to tune in to myself, & re-orient what makes me whole again. I realised that I am better off with my mind fully focused on the labour at hand (which is why I returned to Singapore for work, and force myself to commute across the Causeway 5 hours every weekday) & at accepting that I'm more at peace watching gameplay videos of other people playing non-mainstream games (like Space Engineers or Cities Skylines) or random episodes of QI (missed Stephen Fry).

But yes, it can be shitty to feel powerless against the tides of politics, & the utter meaninglessness of your life compared to the world.

My consolation: go and do charity work. Don't serve for politics: they can be manipulated. I've seen friendships broken because one guy is in PKR and that pisses the hell out of one of my associates, because he was an MCA man.

Do charity work instead.

Feed the homeless, teach for Malaysian needy, offer assistance to the outcasts of society, whether it would be towards refugees in Malaysia, or towards single mothers and women In shelter against domestic violence.

Malaysia is a society of flaws; but it is also the most beautiful. It produces the dregs such as our politicians and some of the royal entourages, but we have world-class athletes, musicians, people who don't toe the mainstream conservative culture here and yet are famous outside of Malaysia. We have diverse fauna in need of protection from greedy developers. We have rainforests in need of gazetting. Native Malaysian tribes risked their tribal lands confiscated in the name of progress.

There are so many of such non-profit causes worthy of our attention.

Vote is your citizen right. The next level of active citizenry is to participate in causes you feel worthy of pursuing.

One couple I knew tracked alongside DAP crew members to drive down to Kelantan & help the Kelantanese get back on their feet in the wake of the 2014 floods. I helped out in Subang Jaya military air base volunteering my time to distribute aid and donation for that.

So don't think about the shitty guttural politics like what you see now. Aim for a cause you want to throw your effort into."

I would also argue that while an event, like Coronavirus for example, can randomly occur, the larger geo-political picture and America's financial domestic agenda are more glacial and don't shift in the big ways you imply they do.

Vice President Mike Pence created a firestorm after he informed agency officials that all messaging related to the coronavirus must be filtered through his office, but a senior Trump administration official said on Friday that was only a temporary pause to ensure proper coordination. Pence’s policy led to some career experts canceling television appearances, though they have told lawmakers the administration is not silencing them. 
“We want open, clear, rapid, fast, transparent communication,” the senior administration official said, pointing to a Friday press briefing with White House officials and Health and Human Services Department Secretary Alex Azar, and other media events. “[Pence] is just trying to make sure they’re not unintentionally scaring the American public by having people on at every hour of every single cable network, and saying different things each hour.”

We have no choice,” Trump said at the Coliseum and Performing Arts Center. “Whether it’s the virus that we’re talking about, or the many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans.”

Additional such cases in California and Oregon were confirmed on Friday.

What about these other 3 paragraphs?


We are magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world,” Trump said of the administration’s preparations to help contain the spread of the virus.


We have to take it very, very seriously ... We are preparing for the worst,” he continued. “My administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States. We are ready. We are ready. Totally ready.”


“We will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country. We have no choice,” Trump said. “Whether it’s the virus we’re talking about or many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans.”

Trump does not think the actual coronavirus is a hoax.  He is referring to how some of the Democratic Party is criticizing him on this coronavirus.  Criticizing what he does and does not do about it.  That is what the leftist news sites are focused on right now.  This article is proof of it.

2020-02-29,camohorse,Anxiety,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/eupik4/coronavirus_megathread/fj2wkci/,"I’m still in freak-out mode because I have Cystic Fibrosis, and that puts me in the “immunocompromised” category. However, I’m very healthy for the CF that I have, and live in the US where I have access to exceptional medical care, so at least I have these things going for me. If I get sick, chances are, it won’t be dire. 

Also, I have an online buddy who lives in Hong Kong (a coronavirus hotspot) and also has CF. She told me even she is unlikely to get sick, because she and her family take care of themselves. As long as you wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, disinfect your stuff, don’t hang out in crowded places, and stay home if you feel sick (unless you are dying, in which case you need to be hospitalized), you will be fine. My friend with CF is healthy and happy despite living in a coronavirus hotspot for a month, and informed me that you can’t get the virus if you stay 2 meters (or roughly 6 feet) away from someone who has it, and avoid touching things they have without disinfecting it first or washing your hands immediately after touching it. 

If my Hong Kong friend can live through this no problem, I can live through this as a citizen of the USA, which means all of y’all can live through this just fine. I do have plans in place in case things get rough. I live in the suburbs in Colorado. If things get bad, I’ll travel to a friend’s house in the country about an hour away from me. Rural areas are less likely to be impacted by the virus for obvious reasons, and I have no problem playing Mario Kart and Minecraft in my buddy’s basement and getting my essentials from the town’s walmart at 2 AM, if it means avoiding getting sick. So, I’ve got that going for me too. 

Still, it’s scary and stressful, especially with the misinformation floating around the internet and being picked up by the mainstream media, which we all know is super, super, super accurate and honest when it comes to news /s. Remember when that Iraqi general was killed, and the news made everyone believe WWIII had started? Yeah. Remember that shit the next time they freak us out. 

I’ve decided to just turn off the news completely. I unfollowed pretty much every political/news subreddit, I unfollowed everyone on facebook who is spreading misinformation, and only go to my local news website to look at the weather. This thread is the only place I get my coronavirus updates from, besides the CDC and WHO, because everywhere else is making this out to be the literal zombie apocalypse. I’m still anxious as fuck, but I’m thankful I live very comfortably and can easily order everything I need to my doorstep, instead of having to leave my house to get it if things get bad. Hopefully, since literally everyone is aware of this virus, people are taking it seriously and won’t allow it to spread.

We ain’t powerless here, people! Wash your hands, don’t touch your face, disinfect your stuff regularly, and stay home if you feel sick. Besides COVID, we have Influenza A, Pneumonia, and all sorts of other fun stuff floating around this winter season. So please, for the sake of everyone, don’t be gross. Be hygienic and stay home if you feel even the slightest cold coming on."

Marketplace Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) harbored viruses highly similar to SARS-CoV (31). Palm civets are of special interest because the virus could be isolated from most marketplace civets, and SARS-CoV can persist in palm civets for weeks (102). Moreover, the sporadic infections observed in 2003-2004 were associated with restaurants in which palm civet meat was prepared and consumed (61, 84). 

The *consumption* of infected animals is known to transmit coronavirus. We do not have live animal to human transmission in previous novel cvirus."

This means as the body goes through the normal immune-loop to produce an anti-body for Generation 1 of the first infection after it tricked the body using HIV proteins to hide ie the asymptomatic 14 day - 30 day period. The virus mutates and a new corona sheath is produced nullifying the first anti-bodies and the immune-loop process repeats.

 The body resolves that, potentially a 14-20 day process and gets Gen-2 but by that time Gen3/Gen4/Gen5 may now exist and the same loop starts again. This is why HIV anti-virals appear to be the only working solution for doctors at the moment.

You catch this and theoretically could need to be on anti-virals for the rest of your life, just like AIDS patients.

Part of it's genetically modified traits is an entirely new, never seen before in nature protein that deals with how it infects the body. This is why the R4.6-6.6 rating and 83% chance of being infected is so alarming. It's airborne, it's a small microbe 0.3% microns and just being around someone not showing symptoms can infect via them just breathing.

Or if they use the toilet as it passes through fecal matter that another person using same bathroom is at high-risk of infection so public washrooms should be avoided if there is a cluster in your area.

The underlying problem is that if you were paying attention to the stock market, then it looked like the economy was doing better than ever. But there were lots of contrary warning indicators including falling industrial production worldwide and a big rise in corporate debt -- big rises in private-sector debt tends to precede recessions. The fundamental problem is that we never restructured the economy after the last recession: central banks have instead maintained growth (albeit slow by historical standards) by keeping interest rates low, allowing companies to take on debt cheap. Trump's tax cuts have also helped companies take out more debt to buy back their own shares and float their stock prices. Trump has continued to juice the economy leading to a ""melt up"" last year, which is when everyone piled into the market to ride it up. But this is not the same as a productivity-led growth boom. 

And what comes up must come down.

Some economists began calling it the ""everything bubble,"" because everything was getting juiced. Pick your asset, and the price has gone way up. But the corporate sector is heavily indebted and vulnerable if there's some kind of shock like the coronavirus.

The other problem is there's very little the Fed can do to reverse a collapse because the virus is causing both demand- and supply-side shocks at the same time. Lowering U.S. interest rates won't stimulate demand in China -- a tent-pole of the world economy -- because the flu has shut everything down, and it'll take a long time to recover once production restarts anyways. Meanwhile there's a supply shock happening to U.S. businesses so domestic production falls off a cliff too. And there's very little room for the Fed to lower interest rates as it is, because they are -- again -- at historic lows.

So... I dunno. [Big crash.](https://youtu.be/PyFz_UAENCo)"

2020-02-29,pooheygirl,Coronavirus,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fb8t6l/coronavirus_melbourne_mum_suzanne_dsilva_on_what/fj2z2qu/," Melbourne mum Suzanne D’Silva, husband Dellone and daughter Bianca, 21, were struck down with dreaded coronavirus as a dream cruise holiday turned into a nightmare. Only son Brenton, 14, was spared. Now 48-year-old Mrs D’Silva, who has returned to Australia with her family, describes what it is like to battle the feared virus — and finally get the all-clear 

 

It started with a temperature and shivering.

I was very weak and the shortness of breath was bad.

My temperature was high, I had a bit of a sore throat but there was nothing out of the ordinary that felt any different to a normal cold or flu.

My daughter Bianca had been diagnosed with coronavirus four days earlier so I knew straight away that’s what it could be.

But by the time I was diagnosed I was already starting to improve. I was still weak but I wasn’t feeling particularly unwell.

My husband Dellone however was getting very sick. His oxygen levels were very low, his blood pressure was very high.

Guys in hazmat suits sprayed us and our bags as we got of the ship and drove us 2 ½ hours away to hospital.

The whole day was a terrifying experience.

&#x200B;

We knew as long as we were in the hospital we couldn’t be in better place to be treated.

I didn’t think we could get any more sick than what we had already been. That was our hope.

My shortness of breath was quite distinctive.

Especially at night I was feeling very out of breath.

The doctor told me the virus had caused pneumonia patches on a lung scan.

But he said the patches weren’t very big which was good and meant it was clearing.

 

I didn’t feel very unwell so I knew at least I was on the mend.

We were on antibiotics but my husband was put on an experimental HIV drugs because he had a terrible cough, low oxygen and his pneumonia was more prominent.

The drug was something that they used on some people in China and that had worked.

When you are really sick it really does play on your mind.

You get worried when you hear the news and you see people are dying.

But all the people who were ill were people who had previous health conditions.

We were quite healthy so we were quite confident our bodies could fight it.

But you are scared because you don’t know what you don’t know. You are just hearing off the news and you’re hoping it will be OK. Each individual person is going to have their own experience of it.

It helped that we were strong enough to actually fight it.

Each day you get a little bit better and you start to see symptoms go and your temperature starts to get back to normal levels. They also monitor your oxygen levels.

When we got the all-clear we were waiting all day. They call it a PCR test — two tests that they have to do 12 hours apart and they both have to be negative for you to get the all-clear. The tests included a throat and nasal swab.

We had the test on the Sunday then we had another test on Monday.

On Tuesday all day we were waiting for the doctor.

Finally the doctor came in late Tuesday night and when I saw his face, through the hazmat mask his eyes had a bit of a sparkle. I was like: ‘Oh my God’. He said: ‘Good news’. We were just over the moon.

It was just such a relief. Now I’m feeling fine. Dellone is still quite weak but we are home and all-clear.

Anyone who is older I really feel sorry for them.

We are very thankful and grateful to all our family and friends and our doctor for all the love, care and support."

I mean, I know we have freedoms here that many countries don't have, I'm grateful.  But I'm aware freedom is delicate, hard to get back if lost, and usually when they take it, they don't blatantly tell you they're taking it from you til it's too late. 

Not to digress, but I do think it's related. 

We are obviously not a 3rd world country, but I do agree we have handled this, well not we, our current ""president,"" has handled this as if we were. In complete denial, dellusion, unprepared, just absurdity.  

We definitely haven't handled it any better than China. I said this somewhere else, but I know China fucked up w the doctor and the underreporting and the delay, but right now, the Trump administration's response isn't much better, like, at all.  

And China actually took action.  I don't see Trump doing anything.  He will never take responsibility or be held accountable.  It's absolutely absurd and frightening.

I'm not really in hysteria about coronavirus I think we should mostly be okay (I hope) but I'm more concerned at the handling of it, the treatment of people who show symptoms and being denied testing, the lack of preparation, and how this handling of it could make it 10000x worse when people don't have accurate data and information to share across the country, and world."

2020-02-29,socialistrob,PoliticalDiscussion,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/fay3ia/how_will_different_voters_react_to_the_stock/fj2wdb7/,"The fact that this prompt is discussing the economic ramifications rather than the disease itself shows that coronavirus hasn't really hit the US hard. 

At a rally today Trump called the virus ""their new hoax"" referring to the Dems. If for instance thousands of Americans are dying, hundreds of thousands are under quarantine, the country is in recession and he is calling the virus a ""hoax"" while golfing then I think it would be perceived very negatively. 

If he is able to act swiftly, calmly and work with international partners to slow the spread and stop the virus then I think he could potentially get a boost in approval from handling a crisis well. 

Katrina is a good historical example. Bush had a political loyalist with no experience in charge of FEMA at the time of the hurricane and he, as well as most high level cabinet members, didn't really appreciate the situation or get the situation under control for weeks. If something similar happens with Coronavirus it could hurt Trump. If Trump handles the situation well it could potentially even help him."

1) Report on the unknowns thus far so we can better prepare. Was the virus they found in the dog a zoonotic host shift or coincidence? Was the person that contracted it a second time not truly recovered or is it mutating and or can’t the immune system develop an immunity meaning a vaccine isn’t feasible? 

2) Report on the failures the Trump administration has done in preparation for this crisis: appoint a crisis “czar” that has a history of praying HIV epidemics away and saying smoking doesn’t kill and lacks any epidemiological or scientific background; gag CDC and public health officials from making any public statement about covid-19 without explicit permission from the aforementioned coronavirus czar; and lastly trump never replaced the pandemic crisis team and tried to cut cdc funding.

Only difference is that Trump is supposed to be in charge of our response, and Bloomberg and Biden are campaigning and trying to find an edge, so who gives a fuck what they say.


And the title is basically missing one word, ""response"".  Trump said that his response to the coronavirus is a democratic hoax.  However, he's being criticized for going against the CDC and repatriating our citizens in Wuhan, they were evaluated by people who didn't have PPE or training on what to do, they were allowed to come and go from the base and stayed in hotels and flew commercial flights, and Trump silenced the main expert who has been through 4 administrations with the CDC.

That's what he's being criticized for, not the shit two losing candidates are saying."

This administration has gutted parts of entire agencies (USDA ERS comes to mind) and left an enormous amount of vacancies in positions critical to our national security. Almost 40 countries don't have ambassadors. Want to talk about the fact that the FEC can't operate because Trump and McConnell won't appoint more members? It seems pretty important that the Federal ELECTION Committee be able to operate during an election year....hmmm... Gutting the entire pandemic response team is just par for the course with this administration. With SARS, MERS, Ebola, Swine Flu, Avian Flu, H1N1, and Zika all around in the last 15 years, why would the White House think it's necessary to have a pandemic response team. Totally NOT their fault at all, am'right.


>White House efforts included reducing $15 billion in national health spending and cutting the global disease-fighting operational budgets of the CDC, NSC, DHS, and HHS. And the government’s $30 million Complex Crises Fund was eliminated.


>In May 2018, Trump ordered the NSC’s entire global health security unit shut down


>The global health section of the CDC was so drastically cut in 2018 that much of its staff was laid off and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10.""




>""Additionally, last year Trump shut down a federal program called Predict that was established ten years ago as a response to the H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. Predict investigated and provided surveillance of infectious diseases and viruses, studied and discovered new diseases that are able to jump from animals to humans, developed testing to detect these viruses, and trained “medical detectives” on the ground across the globe. This federal ability to avert pandemics is now mostly gone, making our ability to contain diseases worldwide significantly more difficult.""


>""In 2017 and 2018, the philanthropist billionaire Bill Gates met repeatedly with Bolton and his predecessor, H.R. McMaster, warning that ongoing cuts to the global health disease infrastructure would render the United States vulnerable to, as he put it, the “significant probability of a large and lethal modern-day pandemic occurring in our lifetimes.”



THEY WERE WARNED AND THEY IGNORED IT.


Now we're all going to pay for their arrogance, greed, and stupidity.

The Trump administration also fly 14 people that had tested POSITIVE for Corona virus on a public airliner, despite objections from the CDC. They had HHS workers deal with the patients **with no PPE**, and then let those workers disperse among the general public with no measures taken. Now we have local transmission *in the same county* and other cases in nearby states.

So yes, this **is** political. We have an incompetent administration that has cut funding to programs designed to fight pandemics and won't listen to the CDC.

The CDC isn’t even ready with testing yet so the virus is probably spreading around the country and we have no way of knowing. There already seems to be some outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest. Our inability to test gives us no way of knowing where the virus is spreading so we can’t take protective measures.

Also, I've heard that the mortality rate is probably much lower because the infection rate of Wuhan is actually significantly higher. I scanned over the article a little and it says CFR is 2.3 which doesn't seem like it's projecting off of a model that includes(or speculates) on real infected number. Something that was posted was mortality rate outside the elderly is very [low](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/).

I think it's reasonable to assume that Wuhan's number are higher than reported because of how strictly it's quarantined and you need infrastructure to actually accommodate the people. It's easier to report a death toll because there's a body. Body count figures will be far more accurate than infected for quarantined area's. 

When considering mortality as well, not just as figures, it's important to also remember the state of the individual that was infected. The general population (not elderly, not in a weakened state of health) aren't really at risk of mortality. It should still be taken *very seriously,* though."

Not tin-foil hatters.

I've known since January 25th, 2020 when virus samples were uploaded outside of China... that is when the medical researchers who have to come up with vaccines and treatments went ape-shit over what they discovered in the genome.

India's report that got stamped out by the disinformation campaign was accurate, this has 4 HIV proteins, SARS/MERS and Encephlatitis proteins.

It is made from a Bat Coronavirus shell which highly mutates. The payload takes a person to serious at 20% meaning you have 1 in 5 chances (playing Russian roulette with a 5 chamber gun) that it might take you to serious/critical where medical attention is needed or you die.

With medical treatment, 20% becomes 6% despite the lies that the media is claiming at 2%. We've even heard the WHO say 20% to serious and 6% death even with medical treatment and it can be an entire month in a hospital until recovered.

However, recovered but not cured is the part most of you are missing in the details. The virus likes to mutate just like HIV and change it's coronavirus outer sheath. This means as the body goes through the normal immune-loop to produce an anti-body for Generation 1 of the first infection after it tricked the body using HIV proteins to hide ie the asymptomatic 14 day - 30 day period (yes it's a bell curve and some people can go potentially longer than 30 days and be infectious without symptoms). The virus mutates and a new corona sheath is produced nullifying the first anti-bodies and the immune-loop process repeats. 

Another click on the 1-5 chamber gun. The body resolves that, potentially a 14-20 day process and gets Gen-2 but by that time Gen3/Gen4/Gen5 may now exist the same loop, the same click of the gun. This is why HIV anti-virals appear to be the only working solution for doctors at the moment.

You catch this and theoretically could need to be on anti-virals for the rest of your life, just like AIDS patients. 

Part of it's genetically modified traits is an entirely new, never seen before in nature protein that deals with how it infects the body. This is why the R4.6-6.6 rating and 83% chance of being infected is so alarming. It's airborne, it's a small microbe 0.3% microns and just being around someone not showing symptoms can infect via them just breathing.

Or if they use the toilet as it passes through fecal matter that another person using same bathroom is at high-risk of infection so public washrooms should be avoided if there is a cluster in your area. 

The bottom line... the media is downplaying the severity of this but countries are preparing for it as in judge by what they do, not what they say. What they say are lies. What they do is more important in exposing that lie. You don't lock down 760 million people in China for the flu. 

What concerns some people who are working on this problem is that the virus although is only 20% to serious, because of the mutations it could theoretically be 100% fatal for anyone catching it without medical treatments over time.

It's still too early to confirm that so it's a very doomy theory. As I was told, this has the potential to wipe Humanity off the map and can become as common as the common cold now that it's part of our viral ecology.

Add to that, you can catch it multiple times, it's Noval no herd immunity meaning no one is immune. You might catch someone's Gen2/Gen3/Gen4 infection while you just have Gen1 causing much more severe chances of going critical and dying if you are around a big cluster of infection.

It was designed to kill, that is its job. It is a weapon. Not designed to give you a hug and kisses.

The reason why people are not alarmed, China is covering up the deaths, burning bodies en mass and lying. Iran had a leak that over 1400 are now dead as of yesterday and that number no doubt is higher today.

Once you present symptoms and you body recovers, the encephalitis portion of the protein sequence is attacking the nervous system where it's hard for blood to access and present antibodies, the nervous system infection is what is causing people who appear fine to suddenly drop into a seizure and die. That kick effect is pretty much sudden death as death can happen within a minute of that event.

Assuming pneumonia and hypoxia (depleted oxygen) doesn't kill you (event 1) or organ failure ie heart attack, liver failure, etc (event 2)... if it's in your nervous system (event 3) will. It's a multi-tiered killer, lots of regions of the body this is affecting: Lungs, Organs, Nervous system.

Death can come from all three regions of infection and depending on the person this is also part of that bell curve so it seems about 6 days average after symptoms to go into critical but can be longer everyone is different and this also has gain-of-function meaning it gets nastier as it adapts to you and can become even more lethal not dropping traits but gaining traits as it evolves unlike a natural virus that can have a loss of function ie become harmless like the cold.

That is why this is real doom folks, not fake doom or fake news. It doesn't care what you believe... if I had a bunker right now I'd be in one but I don't. But many CEOs seem to be bugging out. It's the masses who don't know but trust me, lots of people in power know what this is.

However the ministry of propaganda is controlling information ie the infodemic that the WHO talks about saying to them it's scarier than the virus but the reality is... it will expose the agenda or event 201 reality of this planned mass depopulation event"

Trois soignants de l'hôpital Tenon à Paris ont par ailleurs été testés positifs.

Normal ""reporting"" these days seems to be entity X said this, entity Y said that, and the reporters cannot be bothered (in part because the READERS cannot be bothered) to investigate and report what actually happened. 

Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, did the CDC have infectious disease funds cut, or infectious disease funding increased, or their ID funding increased less than programmed (in Washington that's a funding ""cut...."")? Good luck finding tat out...and if funds were cut PRIOR to the coronavirus outbreak, were they cut ""appropriately,"" or should Congress have anticipated the outbreak and raised funding dramatically to get ahead of the process? 

I read USA Today, Fox News, BBC, and NPR daily; the rate of factual reporting is remarkably low.  Trying to sort out the ""facts"" of a specific event usually takes days (which is not necessarily a bad thing, unless you act on the first story).

>As of 29 February at 9am, a total of 10,483 people have been tested in the UK, of which 10,460 were confirmed negative and 23 positive.

I think the number of cases is low because they were really aggressive with their testing in late Jan/early Feb and found a bunch of cases that could have led to a super-spreader effect if they had gone undetected.

In the continental European countries, they only really started testing in the last week, and that's why they have so many more cases - stuff was left undetected to spread."

I went looking for info about SARS' (original flavor) course. TIL: 

>In about a quarter  of  cases,  a  transient  period  of  clinical  improvement  marks  the  end  of phase  1.  Phase  2  is  the  immune  hyper-reactive  phase,  with  damage  caused  by the  body’s  immune  system.  There  is  recurrence  of  fever,  oxygen  desaturation,and radiological progression of pneumonia or development of adult respiratory distress  syndrome  (ARDS).  **This  phase  is  associated  with  a  fall  in  viral  load.** Phase  3  is  the  pulmonary  destruction  phase.  There  is  usually  no  fever  (unless there are secondary infections) or only a low-grade one. The pulmonary damage,however,  persists  or  even  progresses,  giving  the  lungs  a  honeycomb-like appearance  on  CT  scan.  As  the  pulmonary  disease  progresses,  oxygenation  of blood  cannot  be  sustained  and  the  patient  may  require  breathing  support. Permanent injury and fibrosis of the lung will set in and the patient may succumb as  a  result  of  respiratory  failure  or  may  recover  with  residual  impairment  of pulmonary  functions.  Not  all  patients  go  through  all  three  phases,  especially people  who  are  older  or  have  impaired  immune  systems

[Fucking PHEW.](https://iris.wpro.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665.1/5530/9290612134_eng.pdf). This is not good, but it does feel like a stronger possibility than SARS-CoV-2 causing a persistent infection since no known human coronavirus does that. 

Granted, SARS-CoV-2 is only 80-85% similar to SARS, so it certainly is still well within the realm of possibility it can cause a persistent infection as do some of the bat coronaviruses (and some of those are quite close to SARS-CoV-2 as well). So it's still wait and see. 

But Occam's Razor does seem to suggest that a multiphasic infection explanation for the ""reinfection"" cases might be the most likely case. 

It's still bad, yikes look at that morbidity, but if that is the case and it eventually clears, it's not lung AIDS/herpes/chickenpox/what-have-you as it would be if it were persistent. 

We don't know yet ofc and I'm going to continue to behave as though it might be persistent until it is demonstrated not to be just to be safe."

1) science says two basic sexes, but gender has lost its scientific meaning in my opinion. It carries as much weight as the type of clothes you chose to wear. Wanna be a pansexual, queer leaning, drag queen? Fuckin go for it bud. Doesn't effect my life none. 

2) yes. There's too many people on this planet as it is. We really don't need to bring in more unwanted children so they can have a terrible childhood cause their parents didn't want them to begin with, and they can grow up to be criminals and burdens on society. 10/10 fix. 

3) not a single fucking person believes guns kill people. Mentally ill people with guns kill people. And those mentally ill people probably shouldn't have had those guns in the first place. So unless you're some crazy bible thumping Trump supporting lunatic.. oh wait. 

4) no. Illegal immigration is still illegal. But people who came to America, lived there for multiple decades, contributing to payroll and employment taxes, while not being able to claim any social services because they're illegal, should be given a bit more of a path to citizenship than those who just got here last week. One is clearly more integrated into American society. 🤦‍♂️

5) I thought Obamacare was repealed ? No? 

6) high taxes are great if they come along with ample social programs and government safety nets. High taxes are only good if they're making the lives of everyday citizens better. Right now, your taxes are just paying to make rich people infinitely richer 🤷‍♂️ cause that's fair, right? 

7) see, the first amendment please. 

8) yes. We tend to listen to professionals in their given field. We understand your hesitation to, as your fearless leader has claimed to know more than the WHO on coronavirus, knows where hurricanes are gunna hit more accurately than the NWS, so much so he felt the need to draw his own circle onto a federal storm map (Which is a felony by the way) , and has also claimed to know how the US government and law works better than anybody, while breaking new laws every month.

I want to ride the wave down on my new contributions and I’ll rent-enter the market with my existing holdings once there is more clarity on Coronavirus. I don’t want to be in the market if this is indeed a black swan event.
