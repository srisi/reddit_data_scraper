But efforts to curb the spread of the virus might mean that the planet itself is moving a little less. 

>Researchers who study Earth’s movement are reporting a drop in seismic noise — the hum of vibrations in the planet’s crust — that could be the result of transport networks and other human activities being shut down. They say this could allow detectors to spot smaller earthquakes and boost efforts to monitor volcanic activity and other seismic events.

>Just as natural events such as earthquakes cause Earth’s crust to move, so do vibrations caused by moving vehicles and industrial machinery. And although the effects from individual sources might be small, together they produce background noise, which reduces seismologists’ ability to detect other signals occurring at the same frequency.

The cell surface receptor used by the virus determines which cells within the host is will be able to infect. 

We had already determined that this coronavirus was able to use ace2 as an entry receptor, and this article implies that it can also use sialic acid. Both are widely expressed, so it doesn't change much, but if it's able to use more than one receptor then you cannot rely on inhibiting just ace2 receptor binding if you want to inhibit viral entry into host cells"

(Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-testing-shortages.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-testing-shortages.html))

Here are the first three paragraphs of this piece:

""Of all the resources lacking in the Covid-19 pandemic, the one most desperately needed in the United States is a unified national strategy, as well as the confident, coherent and consistent leadership to see it carried out. The country cannot go from one mixed-message news briefing to the next, and from tweet to tweet, to define policy priorities. It needs a science-based plan that looks to the future rather than merely reacting to latest turn in the crisis.

Let’s get one thing straight: From an epidemiological perspective, the current debate, which pits human life against [long-term economics](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/ARTICLE/ECONOMIC-COST-CORONAVIRUS-RECESSION-COVID-DEATHS), presents a false choice. Just as a return to even a new normal is unthinkable for the foreseeable future — and well past Easter, Mr. Trump — a complete shutdown and shelter-in-place strategy cannot last for months. There are just too many essential workers in our intertwined lives beyond the health care field — sanitation workers; grocery clerks, and food handlers, preparers and deliverers; elevator mechanics; postal workers — who must be out and about if society is to continue to function.

A middle-ground approach is the only realistic one — and defining what that looks like means doing our best to keep all such workers safe. It also means leadership. Above all, it means being realistic about what is possible and what is not, and communicating that clearly to the American public."""

You can use such water both for processing masks and various surfaces, and for spraying in the air, scientists said. The liquid is safe for humans and quite cheap to manufacture - about 100 rubles. per thousand liters."

Lack of equipment for the NHS has been on every news outlet daily. It was discussed at length on the One Show earlier. Hell, I'm pretty sure it has even been discussed in one of the PM's daily briefings recently.


At issue is that they aren't resolving the problem because there quite literally isn't sufficient supply of PPE out there to buy. This could have been avoided if the NHS hadn't been so badly defunded but also because the government in the past has done no planning and prep to stockpile non-perishable necessities like PPE in preparation for this kind of event.


It has nothing to do with ""anti-china"" hype or anything China related. It's all British stupidity sadly.

In the days that followed, Dr. Nikicicz said, he was told that his job was at risk because policy at the hospital where he works, University Medical Center in El Paso, prohibited the use of protective masks in the hallways. “Wearing that mask is essential for me,” Dr. Nikicicz, 60, who has asthma and hypertension, said in an interview.

2020-03-31,TheAmazingFaraday,Winnipeg,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/fsjrua/should_asymptomatic_people_wear_masks/fm20ext/,"There is a big logical gap between people being a) positive for the disease and b) the disease being infectious. Viral disease can be asymptomatic and non-transmissive. The point that people are positive for a viral disease and therefore can infected other people is not true, there is a latent period between being infected and transmission of disease; typically when symptoms show. 

Now for Covid19 that mode of transmission as you pointed out is through droplets. Generally this occurs when sneezing, coughing etc. There is little evidence to support that asymptomatic transfer (viral shedding) of this virus occurs. This is a generalization for viral diseases (
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/viral-shedding). If so the transmission rate is minimal, you would have to be in close proximity for a while. 

This is the reason why people say not to wear mask if you are asymptomatic. You aren't transmitting the disease when you are asymptomatic. Mask generally aren't good for protecting your against other people anyways, it's for preventing you from spreading the disease. The rationale behind this is no one is sneezing in your face, more likely you will touch an object where someone sneezed and then touch your face. 

My own note of whether you should wear mask. If it makes you feel more secure go ahead. But realize there are more effective measures such as routine hygiene and distancing. There is some psychological benefits such as you are less likely to touch your face. These are beneficial but as a physical barrier is doesn't do much. See CDC and WHO recommendation are ignore what peoples ""opinions"" are.

> Senator Elizabeth Warren is pressing federal officials for answers on why they seized at least two of Massachusetts’s recent orders for protective equipment, charging that it appears they are still interfering with states’ efforts to track down medical supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic.

> In a five-page letter Monday, Warren asked Peter Gaynor, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, to outline how the agency is ensuring states aren’t outbid for supplies by the federal government, which she called a “new and inexplicable obstacle.”

> Warren also pointed to at least two instances in which Massachusetts lost orders for ventilators and hundreds of respirators after the federal government stepped in — a situation Marylou Sudders, the state’s health and human service secretary, described as: ""They take what we order.”

> Sudders said the Trump administration also impounded a third order of 3 million masks the state had negotiated to buy earlier in March.

> “Massachusetts state officials are continuing to face federal impediments as they scramble to find essential medical equipment to respond to a public health emergency,” Warren wrote in her letter. “This is unacceptable, and I request answers on behalf of the Commonwealth.”

> Warren asked Gaynor to explain why the federal government seized the two orders from Massachusetts, and to which state the supplies ultimately went, among a series of other questions in the letter.

> Governor Charlie Baker has publicly vented about the roadblocks his administration has faced in tracking down personal protective equipment, including respirators, gloves, and masks. In a call with President Trump on March 19, he said the state had been outbid by the federal government on at least three separate occasions. “I’ve got a feeling that if somebody has a chance to sell to you or to me,” Baker told Trump, “I’m going to lose every one of those.”

> In her letter, Warren criticized the Trump administration for giving Massachusetts only a fraction of the medical supplies it has requested from the Strategic National Stockpile, and said that it’s her “understanding” the state also will be subject to cost-sharing requirements if it seeks more supplies after receiving a large shipment over the weekend. It was the third delivery the state has received from the stockpile.

> “Our nation’s health care system badly needs more resources to test, diagnose, and treat COVID-19 patients,” Warren wrote. “But President Trump’s has underused, or failed to use at all, key procurement and allocation authorities available to the federal government — creating a logistical black hole in the federal COVID-19 response that has left states struggling to find key medical supplies on their own.”

This is a great opportunity to become skillful in dealing with fear. The greatest book ever written in my opinion on this is: ""How to Stop Worrying and Start Living Your Life"" by Dale Carnegie, I promise it will really help you through this. I found these things helpful:  


1. Absolutely limit your news and internet reading to 10 minutes per day looking at responsible websites who aren't trying to alarm you. You will fell 50% better from this alone. Avoid stories which report on singular incidents which tend to be highly unusual and focus on the big data which gives a more accurate picture of what is going on for the country in general.
2. Read positive stories to balance out your viewpoint, cases are now reducing in China, South Korea and Italy and soon enough they will be in the U.S also. It may take 2-3 months but it will pass. 
3. Consider that around 60,000 people a year in the US die of the flu and you do not feel this same level of fear. Have a think about why this is, how the media plays into this. Coronavirus is absolutely something to take very seriously and follow government advice but the fear doesn't necessarily need to be at the level you are describing. 
4. Manage your fear by taking one day at a time. Stop thinking way out into the future and what-ifs just get absorbed in either work or fundraising activities from home during the day. Spend most of the day absorbed in something meaningful which helps people or builds new skills and you'll feel much better.  


Peace to you my friend."

**EDIT:** I'm having trouble finding the Imperial College projection updates themselves, but this story has some details at least: https://www.wired.com/story/the-mathematics-of-predicting-the-course-of-the-coronavirus/

> Birx also took aim at an influential report published earlier this month by disease modelers at Imperial College London that predicted the deadly coronavirus could kill 500,000 Brits before the year was out. These chilling forecasts jolted Boris Johnson’s UK government out of its plan to sit back and wait for herd immunity to take the British Isles.

> The report, which also predicted 2.2 million American deaths if the government did nothing, got President Donald Trump’s attention. Shortly after, the White House rolled out a 15-day social distancing challenge, encouraging Americans to stay home as an act of patriotism. Then the US economy tanked, and Trump got nervous about staying the course. So when one of the Imperial researchers, Neil Ferguson, brought new estimates to the UK parliament last Thursday that predicted a British death toll below 20,000, Trump’s task force seized on the apparent walk-back. “Half a million to 20,000,” Birx said during the Thursday press briefing. “We are looking at that, in great detail, to understand that adjustment.”

> Except Ferguson wasn’t really walking back his estimates or his model. As he explained later in his own series of tweets, the new numbers resulted from two things: The UK government’s implementation of social distancing measures, and a slightly higher R0 gleaned from new data from around Europe that suggests the outbreak is moving faster than at first believed—so more people are infected than anyone knows, with milder symptoms. Ferguson said this should lend more evidence, not less, to the importance of social distancing measures."

If you are using the same bathrooms as your coworkers, if you are interacting with them at all, you are multiplying your risk by the size of each and every single person's social network.

You are trusting each individual coworker and every person in their exposure network to have great personal discipline as it relates to social distancing and minimizing exposure.

If you go back to work, you are greatly increasing your risk of being infected. You are also greatly increasing the risk for your exposure network. Are you comfortable making that decision for them? Ask them what they think about this risk you are taking.

**Economic Risk**

The economic consequences of a coronaVirus infection are likewise quite severe. It will depend on your insurance coverage and deductible, but this article points to out-of-pocket costs of about $1,300 per individual for coronavirus admissions. If your deductible is higher, your cost will be higher. Uninsured individuals are downright f*cked. Have a married partner or other dependents? Multiply the cost by that number, as you will likely infect them before you show symptoms. Even with a mild, non-admitted case of CoViD-19, you will be lying in bed, incapacitated. You won't be able to work, and neither will whoever takes care of you.

**Conclusion**

I want you to be healthy. I want you to be financially stable. Think long and hard about the trade-offs you would be making. Think about the second and third order effects of your decision.

Keep in mind that CoronaVirus relief continues to flow out of all levels of our local, state, and federal governments. Charitable organizations are ramping up relief efforts. Nations such as China and S. Korea are beginning to assist the rest of us in recovery. While this crisis goes on, you will not be evicted. You will not have to pay your student loans. You and your family will not go hungry. As new legislation comes out, substantive assistance will come to you.

Keep in mind the risks to yourself, your family, your community, your nation. Now is not the time to be selfish. I don't want my parents, my grandparents to die. I'm sure you don't want yours to either. Set an example for your kids. Do the right thing."

Without mitigation, estimates have coronavirus infecting 50-70% of the population. That's 150-220 million people at a minimum.

4.4 million vs 40k. If we keep it anywhere close to annual flu deaths, it means we may have saved hundreds of thousands to millions of lives with these measures.

That edict, according to Brennan, has led to 80% of the agency's losses.

The original House bill included a $25 billion appropriation intended to help fund the agency and eliminate its $11 billion in outstanding debt. The measure would also eliminate the USPS's $3 billion annual borrowing cap.

I wouldn't say it is racist so much as a bad call.


When they called it the Spanish Flu they were factually wrong and misleading as it did not start in Spain, it probably started in Kansas.

The reason it was called the Spanish Flu was that it happened during WW1 when most governments had almost complete control over the press, and for morale reasons they didn't want the public to know the actual situation. Spain wasn't directly involved in the war so they were relatively open about the situation. This made it seem to the world like Spain had this crazy flu that was killing everyone, while everyone else had normal or slightly high flu numbers.

Also just because they did something a hundred years ago doesn't mean it is a good idea.

Additionally it already has a specific name covid-19, whereas ""china virus"" is not specific and is going to be useless as a descriptor when another virus originates in China. 

Now it doesn't really matter at the end of the day whether or not you call it the China virus since you aren't setting policy, but our leaders and public health officials should be calling it something useful like covid-19.

The downside to calling it ""China virus"" is that people are using it as a justification to be racist against Asian people. Now some of those people are going to be racist no matter what, but calling it ""China virus"" over and over is just reinforcing a negative association over and created an environment where they are more comfortable over again for no  practical value.

We can use coronavirus or covid-19 and still discuss that it originates in China and that the Chinese government totally fucked up their response and is lying about their numbers."

2020-03-31,ehud42,Winnipeg,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/fsjrua/should_asymptomatic_people_wear_masks/fm1ti8k/,"What I'm reading is that just about any mask - homemade or not - can technically reduce the likelihood of inhaling or spreading the virus. (in other news water is wet).

BUT, they create a host of other problems, which if not understood/managed might actually make the overall situation worse.

Problems:

\#1: false sense of security/over confidence. Don't wear a mask to enable you to do something you would not do without one! If you have to go out, and are going to with mask or not, then the mask will help. But if you can skip the outing, and decide ""I have a mask, therefore I can"" - that is a big problem.

\#2: mishandling the mask. This isn't dust, or paint fumes. This is an active biological agent. As you use the mask it becomes contaminated and a bio-hazard. Touching the contaminated mask with your hands (ie: taking it off) and then not properly washing before touching your face, etc and you have wasted the mask.

\#3: aerosolizing the virus. A bit weak on this theory, but I understand that normally the virus is expelled in droplets which quickly fall down (hence the 2m distancing). I've seen comments that a wet, contaminated mask can aerosolize the virus, allowing it to suspend longer and farther in the air. This is might be why it is crucial to change the mask frequently.

So, masks are good if used properly, bad if not.

They include global passenger airlines, the lodging and cruise industries, and autos. In addition, plummeting energy prices will leave the oil and gas sector exposed, while banks also will face a challenging environment amid falling interest rates that eat into profitability and a deteriorating economy that will undermine credit quality.

>“The coronavirus will cause an unprecedented shock to the global economy,” Edmond DeForest, senior credit officer at Moody’s, said in a report. “We have revised our growth forecasts downward for 2020 as the rising economic costs of the coronavirus shock and the policy responses to combat the downturn are becoming clearer.

>Bay Area Health Officers Issue Updated Stay-at-Home Order with New Restrictions to Last Through May 3
More time and additional restrictions needed to slow the spread and reduce future impact on local hospitals from COVID-19
For Immediate Release

>March 31, 2020
>Health officers in seven Bay Area jurisdictions are extending a previous stay-at-home order through May 3, 2020 in order to preserve critical hospital capacity across the region.

>The previous three-week order was set to expire on April 7. While the prior order has been effective in reducing the rate of transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), it is not enough. There has been a significant increase in the number of positive cases, hospitalization and deaths from COVID-19, which is beginning to strain healthcare resources.

>The health officers have determined that more and stricter social distancing is needed to slow the rate of spread, prevent deaths, and stop the health care system from becoming overwhelmed.

>""Extending the stay-at-home order should reduce the number of sick patients seeking care at one time, giving us time to acquire more medical supplies for providers who will be providing care to people sick with COVID-19. The extension will allow doctors and nurses to better treat those who do get sick, and save countless lives,"" said Dr. Chris Farnitano, health officer for Contra Costa County.

>The new stay-at-home order will supersede the previous order and go into effect at 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, March 31. It is a complement to the indefinite statewide stay-at-home order issued by Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this month.

>Like the previous local order, the new order requires people to stay at home except for doing essential activities, such as grocery shopping, in six counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara, as well as the city of Berkeley. Non-essential businesses will remain closed.

>The new order adds some clarifying language around essential business and activities, as well as some new directives, including:

> * Use of playgrounds, dog parks, public picnic areas, and similar recreational areas is prohibited. These areas must be closed to public use.
> * Use of shared public recreational facilities such as golf courses, tennis and basketball courts, pools, and rock walls is prohibited. These facilities must be closed for recreational use.
> * Sports requiring people to share a ball or other equipment must be limited to people in the same household
> * Requires essential businesses to develop a social distancing protocol before April 3
> * Most construction—residential and commercial—is prohibited
> * Funerals limited to no more than 10 people attending
> * Essential businesses expanded to include service providers that enable residential transactions (notaries, title companies, Realtors, etc.); funeral homes and cemeteries; moving companies, rental car companies and rideshare services that specifically enable essential activities
> * Essential businesses that continue to operate facilities must scale down operations to their essential component only

>Social distancing is the most powerful tool to slow the spread of COVID-19, a virus so new that it has no approved medicines or vaccines.

>""What we need now, for the health of all our communities, is for people to stay home,” said Dr. Grant Colfax, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health. “Even though it has been difficult, the Bay Area has really stepped up to the challenge so far, and we need to reaffirm our commitment. We need more time to flatten the curve, to prepare our hospitals for a surge, and to do everything we can to minimize the harm that the virus causes to our communities.""

So in Victoria there's a temporary ban on some categories of people getting guns, and there has been an increase in *attempts* to buy guns.

Here is the article in it's entirety.

> If you’re not sick with the new coronavirus, should you wear a mask in public? The World Health Organization says no. U.S. officials are mulling if eventually, that advice might change.
> 
> That debate is happening amid a shortage so severe that the Joint Commission, which accredits U.S. hospitals, said Tuesday that if facilities can’t provide proper masks, health workers are allowed to bring their own from home.
> 
> Front-line health workers have the greatest need for masks. And when people are sick, wearing a mask helps lessen the chances of infecting others. In places where relatives care for the sick at home, the WHO also has recommended they wear a mask.
> 
> But “there is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any particular benefit,” WHO’s epidemics chief Dr. Mike Ryan told reporters Monday.
> 
> “In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite,” he added, noting risks from an improperly fitted mask or touching the face while taking it off or putting it on.
> 
> For months as the COVID-19 crisis grew and masks disappeared from store shelves, U.S. health officials have agreed. The virus is believed to spread mostly through droplets from coughs or sneezes rather than tinier particles that health workers can encounter, and thus the main advice has been to keep your distance — staying 6 feet away.
> 
> “Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!” Surgeon General Jerome Adams wrote in a February 29 tweet. “They are not effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk.”
> 
> But mask-wearing has long been common in some countries during respiratory outbreaks, especially in parts of Asia. But as questions grow about whether people sometimes can spread the virus before realizing they’re sick -- which social distancing is supposed to address — increasingly people ask what it would hurt to wear some form of mask in public.
> 
> Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, said the White House coronavirus task force is looking into the idea but first must make sure that such a move wouldn’t take away from the supply for health workers.

> ‘I Saw Another Woman on the Platform Do an Obvious Double Take’
> 
> “But once we get in a situation where we have enough masks, I believe there will be some very serious consideration about more broadening this recommendation of using masks,” Fauci said in a CNN interview Tuesday. “We're not there yet, but I think we're close to coming to some determination.”
> 
> For now, the advice posted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website: “If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a face mask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a face mask)."""

With the whole Coronavirus pandemic, the pet shop I work has stopped doing deliveries and grooming is allowed only for the services that were paid in advance. I sent all clients a 3 paragraph text explaining that:

We don't do deliveries for an undetermined amount of time. Grooming is reserved for clients who have already paid in advance. If you paid in advance but will not bring your dog, we can reschedule at no extra cost. We would rather have you stay outside of the store so someone will get everything you need at the door so contact is minimized. Do what you can to stay safe and contact us for any doubt.

It was maybe 10 lines long  (which becomes about 20 in texting because the lines are shorter). I sent it to about 70 clients, all upper middle class.

Let me tell you that it has been a rollercoaster. Rode the highs of TSLA stock in which I used the gains to get into options trading. Rode the waves of MSFT and NVDA calls until coronavirus caused it to come crashing down. Started from scratch and became a bear, bought puts on airlines and rideshare taking my portfolio back to where it started. Until recently I started trading VXX and 3X bear ETFS in which I lost $2.3K in the span of a week. For some odd reason, it didn't phase me. It just felt like numbers on a screen. What I took away from it, is that everyday you try something new, there is a cost to it. Think of it as insurance to never make that mistake ever again. There is a lot more to lose when your portfolio ultimately grows, and it will. Think of today's losses as guarantees for tomorrow's gains

1 - Rockstar like to announce things on their own terms because of how long their games take to develop. Most games these days are shat out in two to three years, often unfinished & buggy. A lot of this can be attributed to forced deadlines through expected event reveals & launch windows. Bear in mind an E3 trailer or demo alone takes months to be fine tuned & glossed up, which takes time & resources. Given that a Rockstar game takes closer to a decade to be created with modern technology, it only makes sense that they host their own announcements.

2 - Rockstar have always maintained an image as being somewhat outside the general games industry, despite being one of the more well known & profitable development studios. After their Xbox 360 partnership with IV, they’ve very much maintained a reputation for independence from the big manufacturers & events. 

3 - Rockstar games are a huge cultural event, which is amplified by them having their own release announcements. E3 can sometimes be a mess of game announcements, especially in a year like 2020 (prior to the Coronavirus) where you have new consoles & huge system sellers like Halo Infinite poised to steal the spotlight."

>  these masks technically aren't helping anyone, even you, to stop the spread

I don't know what it's going to take to get folks to see that CDC was either dead wrong about this or was trying to stave off a panic knowing there were already mask shortages as far back as January.

You sound so confident, but our CDC is [likely to reverse](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/31/824560471/should-we-all-be-wearing-masks-in-public-health-experts-revisit-the-question) this guidance anyway. The [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) simply says more research is needed. I personally can't find any source other than the US CDC that says masks aren't advised. 

Look, think about this rationally... If a basic surgical mask even reduces the wearer's risk of exposure by 60% it's worth it, and since _anyone_ could be an asymptomatic carrier, they're also reducing the risk of unknowingly infecting others. 

Simple, inexpensive, noninvasive harms reduction. It's something everyone can do, it certainly doesn't hurt, and we're saving the N95s for you. 

Don't make us civilians feel dumb about doing what we can to slow the spread when we have to be out in public. 

Hell, CDC even recommends improvised masks for healthcare workers if N95's aren't available. Why isn't that good enough for the average citizen as well?

“Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.”

Translation: **A positive test doesn’t guarantee that the COVID virus is causing infection at all. And, ahem, reading between the lines, maybe the COVID virus might not be in the patient’s body at all, either**.

From the World Health Organization (WHO): “Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) technical guidance: Laboratory testing for 2019-nCoV in humans” [2]:

“Several assays that detect the 2019-nCoV have been and are currently under development, both in-house and commercially. Some assays may detect only the novel virus [COVID] and some may also detect other strains (e.g. SARS-CoV) that are genetically similar.”

Translation: **Some PCR tests register positive for types of coronavirus that have nothing to do with COVID—including plain old coronas that cause nothing more than a cold**.

The WHO document adds this little piece: “Protocol use limitations: Optional clinical specimens for testing has [have] not yet been validated.”

Translation: **We’re not sure which tissue samples to take from the patient, in order for the test to have any validity**.

From the FDA: “LabCorp COVID-19RT-PCR test EUA Summary: ACCELERATED EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA) SUMMARYCOVID-19 RT-PCR TEST (LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA)” [3]:

“…The SARS-CoV-2RNA [COVID virus] is generally detectable in respiratory specimens during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status…THE AGENT DETECTED MAY NOT BE THE DEFINITE CAUSE OF DISEASE (CAPS are mine). Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities.”

Translation: **On the one hand, we claim the test can “generally” detect the presence of the COVID virus in a patient. But we admit that “the agent detected” on the test, by which we mean COVID, “may not be the definite cause of disease.” We also admit that, unless the patient has an acute infection, we can’t find COVID. Therefore, the idea of “asymptomatic patients” confirmed by the test is nonsense. And even though a positive test for COVID may not indicate the actual cause of disease, all positive tests must be reported—and they will be counted as “COVID cases.” Regardless**.

From a manufacturer of PCR test kit elements, Creative Diagnostics, “SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Multiplex RT-qPCR Kit” [4]:

“Regulatory status: For research use only, not for use in diagnostic procedures.”

Translation: **Don’t use the test result alone to diagnose infection or disease. Oops.**

“non-specific interference of Influenza A Virus (H1N1), Influenza B Virus (Yamagata), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (type B), Respiratory Adenovirus (type 3, type 7), Parainfluenza Virus (type 2), Mycoplasma Pneumoniae, Chlamydia Pneumoniae, etc.”

Translation: **Although this company states the test can detect COVID, it also states the test can read FALSELY positive if the patient has one of a number of other irrelevant viruses in his body. What is the test proving, then? Who knows? Flip a coin**.

“Application Qualitative”

Translation: **This clearly means the test is not suited to detect how much virus is in the patient’s body. I’ll cover how important this admission is in a minute**.

“The detection result of this product is only for clinical reference, and it should not be used as the only evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The clinical management of patients should be considered in combination with their symptoms/signs, history, other laboratory tests and treatment responses. The detection results should not be directly used as the evidence for clinical diagnosis, and are only for the reference of clinicians.”

Translation: **Don’t use the test as the exclusive basis for diagnosing a person with COVID. And yet, this is exactly what health authorities are doing all over the world. All positive tests must be reported to government agencies, and they are counted as COVID cases.”**

Those quotes, from official government and testing sources, torpedo the whole “scientific” basis of the test.

2. Symptomatic treatments does not negate death tolls nor does it slow down the spread of pandemic.

3. If one half of the hemisphere managed to get rid of the virus while the other half is still infested with it, we still have a global pandemic in our hands. Only need 1 guy over the course of a week to infect 51 thousand people.

4. There has been several reports of people getting reinfected by the virus.

There are currently (at least) 35 established labs worldwide currently working towards finding a cure. Even an idea for a cure would be great but:

“Like most vaccinologists, I don’t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.


“Getting a vaccine that’s proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what’s needed for a global immunisation programme,” says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics (2018). “Virus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.”

[Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-it-be-ready) 

It is in fact only the beginning. Best case scenario we’re looking at 1-2 million deaths worldwide. That would be the best case scenario. We haven’t even reached hundred thousands yet.

All the measures implemented up until now is not to stop the virus. It is only slow down the spread and to ensure that the spread is not quick enough that it doesn’t overload our capacity to treat the weak. Keyword: Slowdown Spread. Not stop virus, not stop deaths. Slowing it down.

We’re not avoiding recession.

We are slowing down the impact so that we’re not going into an economic depression.

> The UK faces a surge in food waste after supermarket sales jumped by a fifth andrestaurants were ordered to close as part of the government’s measures to fight thecoronavirus pandemic.
> 
> [Figures released by Nielsen](https://www.ft.com/content/cf153651-09f3-4cf5-a012-e4f823b648be), the market data provider, on Tuesday showed that shoppers [bought an extra £1.9bn](https://www.ft.com/content/cf153651-09f3-4cf5-a012-e4f823b648be) of groceries and personal goods in the four weeks ending March 21, leaving many stores and warehouses without stock. 
> 
> The subsequent shutdown of the hospitality sector then delivered a second dose of heavy disruption to a supply chain that relies on stability and predictability to keep stock moving and minimise waste.
> 
> “When you rock the supply chain like this it becomes really inefficient,” said Mette Lykke, founder of food waste reduction app Too Good To Go. Hayley Conick, UK manager for the start-up, added that the stockpiling of groceries was “concerning”. “The risk for increased food waste is huge during these
> extraordinary times,” she said.
> 
> For Tony Reynolds, that risk has already become reality. Over the past few days the managing director of the food supply business that bears his family name, has had to discard about a quarter of his stock of tomatoes, bananas, avocados and mushrooms.
> 
> His customers — hotels, pubs and restaurants — have been told to shut up shop due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some of them, such as Italian-themed chain Carluccio’s, have already [gone into administration](https://www.ft.com/content/159bfd38-6d44-4e88-9734-13ea254114d1).
> 
> Chefs demand produce in peak condition, so stock is usually out of the door again within 48 hours of arrival — there are no “ripen at home” fruits or vegetables.
> 
> “There’s an old saying in this business: either it sells or it smells,” said Mr Reynolds. “We have tried to find a home for it . . . we’ve moved it into wholesale and retail, then given it to charities,” he added, pointing out that what is left is no longer fit for consumption.
> 
> Restaurants have also tried to hand on surplus food. Chains such as Zizzi, D&D, McDonald’s and PizzaExpress have donated excess stock to charities.
> 
> Lindsay Boswell, chief executive of food charity FareShare, said the pandemic had “given with one hand and taken away with the other”. The organisation normally distributes about 1m meals a week from surplus food donated by supermarkets and the food industry.
> 
> “The rise in [panic buying](https://www.ft.com/content/e7cb5812-6b85-11ea-89df-41bea055720b) [in supermarkets] meant that demand exceeded supply and there was no surplus . . . [so] we were receiving less than a third of what we normally would.”
> 
> The hoarding was followed by a fall in demand as cupboards and freezers filled. That drop in retail sales coincided with the shutdown of the catering industry, which led to a pile up of unsold produce.
> 
> Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, pointed out that it was not easy for catering supplies to be redirected into retail outlets. “The pack sizes are different, the labelling is different,” he said.
> 
> He warned that his members’ warehouses were filling up again. “In four to six weeks we will see pretty high levels of occupancy,” he warned. “That could create problems for [meat and poultry] processors if they cannot store product.”
> 
> Vita Mojo, a developer of software for restaurant businesses, has developed newproducts to help suppliers redirect unwanted produce by selling online.
> 
> “It's crazy to see really lovely fruit and vegetables going to waste while people are clambering over themselves in supermarket aisles [to buy some],"" said founder Nick Popovici.
> 
> High levels of wastage are unusual in the food industry. According to Mr Reynolds in normal times, just 0.5 per cent of his stock is discarded. The proportion is similar at leading supermarkets, which have made major strides in reducing waste in recent years.
> 
> British consumers are less efficient, however. They are responsible for more than 50 percent of food waste, throwing away about 4.5m tonnes each year at a cost of £700 per household, according to Waste and Resources Action Plan, a charity.
> 
> Pictures have already emerged on social media showing domestic dustbins overflowing with unopened loaves of bread and chilled food.
> 
> Mr Boswell, of FairShare, hopes the pandemic will force a rethink of how food is sold in the UK. “Looking at the resilience of the supply chain has got to be something that is a national priority,” he said.
> 
> “If the government, in the cold light of day, does not reflect on that then they are perhaps not doing what we have put them in power to do.”"

Maybe the coronavirus will have a similar effect; that the average person doesn't want to be lectured about how we address and criticize China and their shit communist government for lying about the virus to save face as they welded people into their apartments and presumably left them to starve and die, to be buried among the rubble when they eventually condemn and destroy the complexes in which they lived. And yet, the media expects us to treat them nicely since they get a massive check from CCP-owned Tencent in order to convince us to shut up about China and their egregious abuse of human rights. Corporate executives continue to make up excuses for keeping their manufacturing in China, rife with their human rights abuses and open hostility to the country they sell their product in, saying we have to rely on them if we want to afford our goods; the very same excuse the slave owners had for slavery.

Thought it might be anxiety, but I took an anti-anxiety and nothing changed. In fact since I got home from work the pain has worsened. 

I have to work tomorrow, in a bank and I don’t want to spread this if I have it. But I also have very little paid time off. I don’t want to commit to getting swabbed and take a test away from someone that really really needs it. It could be something else. Thought my asthma has never made me feel like this.

Should I get tested? I’m in a rock and a hard place here."

Sounds like you should assume you have the virus and follow exactly what they recommend at the Ontario health site: https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus. Water, rest...anything they recommend. You can keep trying Telehealth. I have heard of others who are waiting as well, so you’re not alone...it’s a part of being above the curve I suppose, and they likely can’t train people or get people fast enough in the short term. The worst you could be is wrong and that you don’t have it, but for ease of conscious ( instead of guessing/waiting), assume you do. 

It sounds as though you are doing all the right steps and quarantining yourself. Therefore, keep doing what you’re doing and keep yourself and others safe. Is there something you have to occupy your time, like a video game? If you need anything, reach out to friends or this community...I don’t live anywhere close by but have read about others helping those in need by shopping for them, and I believe they’d do it again.

“Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They're politicizing it.

They can't even count their votes in Iowa, they can't even count. No, they can't. They can't count their votes.

That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they've been doing it since he got in. It's all turning, they lost. It's all turning, think of it, think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that's been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.""

From what I see, it looks like what he is referring to as the hoax is that the virus is going to get bad. At the end he is trying to downplay it since there where only 15 people infected at the time. That is in line with his not taking the virus seriously and even attempting to get the country back up and running sooner than it should despite warnings by the health experts. That is, until he finally saw the body bags getting loaded into the refrigerator trucks this week and could no longer downplay it."

Copy and pasting my previous post about them:  
As a service, it's convenient for patients for sure but I have some reservations about Telus and Babylon as companies and their priorities. In the past, Telus has been criticized for things like inserting advertising from drug companies into prescriptions: [https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2017/09/14/big-pharma-marketing-scheme-banned-by-ontario.html](https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2017/09/14/big-pharma-marketing-scheme-banned-by-ontario.html).

For context, Telus owns the following health ventures:

* 7+ out of 10 of the most popular electronic medical records used by medical clinics
* 2 telehealth providers
* 30+ private concierge medicine clinics including Medisys/Copeman
* Pharmacy analytics and management software
* Prescribing/eReferral software
* Third-party/insurance claim software
* A medical alert service
* Apps for people to store their personal health information and immunization records
* They also invest in some health tech companies in the US

Their privacy policies and what they can potentially patient information does not inspire confidence:  [https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1241413636834222081.html](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1241413636834222081.html)

In regards to Babylon specifically, they have made shady government deals in the UK allowing them to game the system. Essentially they were able to take funding away from proper family practices by cherry picking patients. There are a few articles about it here: [https://www.wired.co.uk/article/babylon-health-nhs](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/babylon-health-nhs), [https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/12/17/this-health-startup-won-big-government-dealsbut-inside-doctors-flagged-problems/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/12/17/this-health-startup-won-big-government-dealsbut-inside-doctors-flagged-problems/)

Of relevance, Telus Babylon has done something similar in Canada. They recently launched in Alberta in an exclusive deal to provide telehealth services to Albertans. They were able to bypass the normal privacy and regulatory road blocks through corporate influence. They were also able to negotiate a contract where Telus gets paid 2x what everyone else receives per telehealth visit. Article here: [https://globalnews.ca/news/6708432/alberta-doctors-babylon-app-virtual-care-health-coronavirus/](https://globalnews.ca/news/6708432/alberta-doctors-babylon-app-virtual-care-health-coronavirus/).

They also have an pseudo-AI chatbot which they try to claim is better at diagnosis than doctors which has been shown to be dangerous in some cases: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQm-wnUJNrU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQm-wnUJNrU). Lots of flaws with the methodology of their claims.

A significant part of Babylon is owned by Saudi Arabia which bothers me on a personal level due to their history of human rights violations. They are also increasingly expanding into China with partnerships with WeChat which has me worried about data sharing."

There is less than 5% chance Dr. Protsenko was incubating the virus when he met Putin, even less likely he was infectious.

Its clinical presentation contrasts to that of ""typical"" pneumonia. A variety of microorganisms can cause it.

The therapy successfully treated one infected COVID-19 patient at the University of Miami Hospital, who then was discharged, the company said. It is looking to test nitric oxide on other patients as well.

“I’m cautiously optimistic,” said Hunter Gillies, Bellerophon’s chief medical officer. “We always like to see good basic science seeing that a drug might work. Certainly, if this first patient is representative of patients going forward, then yes, I’m cautiously optimistic.”

The initial treatments are being conducted under what the Food and Drug Administration calls “compassionate use,"" allowing drugs to be used for purposes they previously have not been approved for.

Gillies said the company is working with the FDA to set up a formal trial to see if nitric oxide is an effective treatment and can be approved for the coronavirus. They could have an answer as to its effectiveness within months, he said.

The experience with SARS encouraged the company to see if it would work for COVID-19 as well, Gillies said. And with the portable equipment, a patient doesn’t have to stay in the hospital.

“We know it can kill these sorts of viruses,” he said. “We also know nitric oxide improves blood flow to the lungs. Hopefully, we can make patients feel better, get them out of hospitals, reduce the burden on the intensive care units, reduce the number of patients needing ventilators."""

To add to the discussion some things that had crossed my mind were:

What happens if between now and the exam your community becomes a hotspot? How are you supposed to study or focus if people around you are coming down sick?

What if you get the virus, but either live somewhere where you can't easily get tested or it takes a while to get tested? What if you're just starting to get sick the day of your exam? If you were to have the symptoms of coronavirus but not a.positive test result that could very well prevent you from doing the exam without ""medical proof"". 

Obviously this is a bit of wishful thinking on my part but I've seen at least one example from around the world of professors choosing to just give everyone a passing grade rather than administer any more assessments and it really seems to me like the best thing for everyone would be to give every student either a C (or greater if they are currently with a higher mark in the course). That way everyone passes, and everyone graduates.

I'm in no way underestimating the severity of the problem. I'm concerned about my loved ones and I'm staying home or practicing rather exaggerated social distancing when outside. Cleaning everything everywhere. It's just that the information flow is overwhelming. I'm a highly-functioning anxious person so I might have gotten overwhelmed faster than the average internet user.

It didn't have to be this way. This is what bribery and blind belief does to the world.

I'm stuck outside of my home country and I'm living with elderly neighbours. My home country has been rather proactive in this whole mess unlike the place where I'm currently living. I'm an international Biology student and I've been listening to reports about the Coronavirus at least twice a day since January. At that point, I would've been considered an alarmist if I voiced the concern I had. I've always had an interest in Epidemiology and Immunology so the news updates quenched my thirst for stuff to learn from those fields. 

But around the time my uni notified us abruptly that from 16th March our classes would be moving online, I lost interest in this whole virus thing. From a medical and scientific perspective, there has been no significant new discovery about the progression of disease since February. I heard what safety measures over 20 larger countries have implemented, as well as the analysis of efficiency of those measures. The past month I just keep hearing the same things over and over. 

And over, and over. New are only the numbers. 

Everyone's obsessed with numbers now, it seems. Cases. Deaths. R0. Severe cases. Asymptomatic cases.  Mask availability. Stocks. Funds. Toilet paper. It feels like a bland numbers game now with losers across the whole spectrum.

And there has been a surge in people trying to visualize the data and publish it and they are all praised like they just found a cure for this shit. I've been using wuflu.info since January and it's more than enough for me. For a Biologist, phylogeny of the strains is also interesting. Most visuals are just the same world map with (rarely) a different color palette.

Then come the initiatives. The volunteers over-eager to help everyone. The hashtag shouters. The marketing overloaders. Those who make platforms for sharing Corona-time ideas. Everyone trying to join into the Corona response wagon and expressing constant verbal support so much that it seems that people turned to robots. I have barely anyone to talk to right now because all they're thinking about is Corona. I don't want to answer messages. I don't want to answer calls. I don't want to see the memes. I don't want to get a Corona ad whenever I watch a video game or cartoon theory.

Much if production shifting to manufacturing ventilators? Each ventilator needs to have a qualified person operating them. Some studies showed good results with multiple people hooked to the same ventilator. But do we have enough people who are trained to treat the sick? Even if we do, do we have the required facilities to allow the personnel to do their job?  What are the students of Pharmacy and Medicine/Health Science actually helping with during this time? Why do we have to listen to physicists talk about this and trust them like they're a virologist?

Where the hell will all this be left to rot when it ends, because it will, sooner or later? It's not like anyone will change their way of living after this. Maybe for a few extra months everyone will still be cautious. But what does cautiousness do when so many people don't give a shit if you're sick or not unless you're in a risk group?

But CCP will still have everyone's necks in their hands because they produce everything for a price that makes it available to a lot of people. Other countries will be getting tons of aid from China for a long enough time that everyone will be in huge debt to them  It makes us question whether globalization was worth this. All trade ending up directed by the cheapest node of the net. Everyone who suffers will be silenced or publicly ashamed. Sovereignty given up to live cheaply, with the terrible consequences of the cheapness ignored because of the munnies.

What even is the state of our world?"

But will that mean an end to social distancing, or could we be facing a lockdown until the end of the year?

Here are the most likely scenarios:

### 1. Intermittent social distancing

All scenarios involve waiting until the virus has peaked and the number of deaths has started to fall dramatically before any action will be taken.

If our timeline mirrors China, the Government could be in a position to consider lifting restrictions by early summer.

Under the first strategy, [some social distancing and lockdown measures would continue throughout much of the year](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-latest-uk-deaths-tests-nhs-covid-19/), but there would be breaks in which life would get back to normal.

For example, social distancing could be alternated on a regional basis to give people a rest from draconian restrictions. 

The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has proposed that parts of the country could enjoy greater freedoms for six months at a time, before returning to lockdown.

Several apps have recently come online, tracking symptoms throughout the country, which could give public health officials an idea about where hotspots are, so they can be locked down early. Lockdown may also be re-established as we move towards the winter months and the NHS finds itself under increased pressure.

Paul Hunter, Professor of Medicine at the University of East Anglia said: ""Personally, I suspect that the disease will tail off during June and July, partly because of social distancing, partly because of increased population (herd) immunity, and partly because these sorts of infections tend to spread less readily during the summer.

""So I suspect there will be some relaxation at that time. But I think it may come back, though less aggressively, in the autumn, and social isolation may need to be strengthened for a while.""

A fragmentary, regional lockdown would give the NHS a series of breaks, allowing it to ramp up capacity and then enjoy quieter periods.

And it would allow time for a vaccine or treatment to be created and for immunity in the population to build up slowly.

Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It's almost certain to be a partial release. Whatever measures are relaxed, that runs the risk that the epidemic curve will start to increase again.

“Extending the lockdown buys you more time to raise the capacity in the NHS. That wouldn't solve the epidemic problems, and you would need to be in another lockdown eventually - but it would give us longer.”

### 2. Allow the healthy and immune out 

Shielding the vulnerable, and allowing the healthy or immune out to carry on with their lives and get back to work, could be a way to break the deadlock and allow major parts of society to return to normal. 

The Government has promised that [antibody tests - which show whether someone has had the virus and is now immune - will be available within weeks](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/30/covid-19-coronavirus-test-home-antibody-kits/), and Britons could soon be issued ""immunity certificates"" that would allow them to leave the lockdown.

In the coming weeks, public health experts are also due to start community surveillance to find out how many people have had the virus, which could end the need for a lockdown.

Prof Hunter added: ""If a large proportion - somewhere around 60 per cent - of the population become immune,  the lockdown will not serve that much more purpose as [herd immunity](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/15/what-herd-immunity-mean-will-stop-coronavirus-uk/) will be at a level that the disease would struggle to spread. So, lockdown over.

""One thing that may happen, is that people who can prove that they had the infection and are now immune may be allowed more access to work, etc.

""If social distancing has worked and the NHS has survived then, we are likely to see a much smaller proportion of the population being immune. The risk of relaxing too early is that you then get a second peak. 

""However, subsequent peaks will usually be less dramatic and potentially more manageable.""

Under this scenario, the Government could also bring in weekly testing for people most at risk of spreading the disease, such as doctors, nurses, supermarket workers and delivery staff.

Prof Woolhouse said: ""We could change tack slightly. At the moment the emphasis is very much on reducing transmission in the community, but if shielding the vulnerable could be enhanced including very rigorous testing with infected persons being isolated then that will save lives.

""It will also reduce the burden on the NHS and it will also allow the rest of us to be released from some of the measures.""

[Germany, which is carrying out hundreds of thousands of tests](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/why-does-germany-have-low-coronavirus-death-rate/), is planning to give certificates to citizens. 

Prof Karol Sikora, Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham said: ""Germany has got testing spot-on.

""They plan to test hundreds of thousands for the presence of the antibodies and issue 'immunity certificates' to those who test positive, allowing their work to be exempt from the lockdown. This information will be a huge weapon against the virus.""

2020-03-31,yakattack1234,neoliberal,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fs88gu/discussion_thread/fm1mqt3/,"From the Bulwark's free subscription service: 

#1. He Did This

Yesterday the death toll from COVID-19 eclipsed the death toll from 9/11. I wrote about it [here](https://thebulwark.com/covid-19-is-bigger-than-9-11/).

That piece sparked an email exchange last night with a buddy of mine. He's super smart. Works in the health sector. Is not a Trump guy by any means. His argument to me was that the failings in the executive branch were less the fault of Trump, personally, than failures of the health agency bureaucracy generally.

I don't buy that, for two reasons:

First, if you're the president and, by early February, the coronavirus isn't top of mind for you, then you're too stupid to hold the office.

And if a possible global pandemic is top of mind for you, then your #1 and #1(a) priorities have to be riding herd on the rapid development / procurement of tests and the stockpiling of critical medical supplies. If you fail to do this, then you're too incompetent to hold office.

But those are the real-world reasons why I think it is entirely fair to hold Trump accountable for the executive branch's failure to properly prepare to manage the coronavirus during the critical period between its emergence in China and its arrival in America.

There's another reason: Trump himself told us that the president is accountable for bad things that happen on his watch.

At a Republican debate on February 13, 2016, Trump got into an exchange with Jeb Bush in which he argued that President George W. Bush should have been impeached for the Iraq war and was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. [Here's the transcript](https://time.com/4224275/republican-debate-transcript-south-carolina-ninth/):
 

>BUSH: And while Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I’m proud of what he did.
And he has had the gall to go after my brother.
TRUMP: The World Trade Center came down during your brother’s reign, remember that.
BUSH: He has had the gall to go after my mother. Hold on. Let me finish. He has had the gall to go after my mother.
TRUMP: That’s not keeping us safe. . . .

>RUBIO: I just want to say, at least on behalf of me and my family, I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore.
And you can—I think you can look back in hindsight and say a couple of things, but he kept us safe. And not only did he keep us safe, but no matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was in violation of U.N. resolutions, in open violation, and the world wouldn’t do anything about it, and George W. Bush enforced what the international community refused to do.
And again, he kept us safe, and I am forever grateful to what he did for this country.
TRUMP: How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center—the World—excuse me. I lost hundreds of friends. The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe, Marco. That is not safe.
>RUBIO: The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didn’t kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him.
TRUMP: And George Bush—by the way, George Bush had the chance, also, and he didn’t listen to the advice of his CIA.


So those are the rules of engagement, as laid out by Donald Trump himself.

And if you want further evidence, last week a reader sent me a picture of a piece of mail he received from the CDC. Take a look: 

https://imgur.com/a/P8wQZwj

You like that? When the CDC screws up, Trump has nothing to do with it. Not his fault! When the CDC successfully sends out guidelines, they've literally got ""President Trump's"" personal brand on them.

He can't have it both ways.

He did this."

Longtime content creator, probably been using Brave+BAT for 9+ months and have had a Brave link on the panel on our Twitch channel: [http://twitch.tv/crosscountertv](http://twitch.tv/crosscountertv)

We focus on fighting games, but have recently (in a post-coronavirus world) have also been doing coverage of covid-19 and other current event-type of things.  

This past weekend, we launched a new series called Quarantine Cup, which is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek show set in the year 2040 where we're dealing with covid-29 lol. 

Anyways, I want to live in a world where people can compete in online tournaments using BAT so that's the agenda we've been subtly pushing for a little while, but I dunno...as you all I'm sure are familiar with...we are still quite a ways away from real adoption. 

But hey that's the opportunity!

Thanks in advance for checking out the channel."

So one of the big lessons of this crisis is that when there's an obvious potential for a massive disaster on the horizon, we can't just assume that our institutions will just work everything out.

In light of that, what are some disasters that could plausibly happen in the near to medium term future that we are woefully inadequately prepared for?

The obvious examples to me are:

* Human-level general artificial intelligence

* Climate change

* Antibacterial resistance

* Another pandemic

A non-obvious one is:

* [The Earthquake That Will Devastate the Pacific Northwest](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one)

What is going to cause this huge surge everyone is talking about?  I looked into the incubation period, it's typically 5 days, with 97% of patients showing symptoms after 11 days.  So, with so much of the US in lockdown with stay at home orders for as long as it has been going on, shouldn't the vast majority of people have already had symptoms and gone to the hospital, therefore preventing this large surge?  I know we already had quite a surge, but not to the apocalyptic levels they're predicting in the United States.

But anyways, the US government messed up the mask situation as well as the hospitals not keeping enough in stock. 

As for the US govenrment, [we sent a bunch to China](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-announces-assistance-to-combat-the-novel-coronavirus/), and [we also auctioned off government owned masks.](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/2020033016356/with-coronavirus-concern-building-world-wide-us-sold-off-n95-masks). The US government screwed that up worse than any individual with a 5pack of N95s in their garage.  But my original point was more around the masks that hospitals do not use.  

For example, UCSD is very particular (and so are quite a few hospitals): https://health.ucsd.edu/coronavirus/Pages/donate.aspx  ""N95 respirators – only 3M branded models 1870+ or 8210"" & ""Medical-grade procedure and surgical masks only"".  

Various other masks people have can certainly help prevent catching or spreading the virus, but are not acceptable in a hospital setting.  Even if it's like a 20% effectiveness rate, to me that's better than zero."

AUSTIN (KXAN) — Austin Public Health is investigating a large group of people with a cluster of positive COVID-19 cases returning from a Spring Break trip to Mexico, the agency said Tuesday.

APH says about a week and-a-half ago, the group comprised of approximately 70 adults in their 20s left for a spring break trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Currently, 28 of the 70 have tested positive for COVID-19, and more of them are under public health investigation. The University of Texas at Austin confirmed “many of those involved” were UT Austin students.

“The virus often hides in the healthy and is given to those who are at grave risk of being hospitalized or dying,” APH Interim Health Authority Dr. Mark Escott said.

“While younger people have less risk for complications, they are not immune from severe illness and death from COVID-19,” he said.

APH says UT Health Austin and University Health Services have made contact with every person on the trip, and all 28 people who tested positive for COVID-19 are self-isolating. Others are under quarantine while being monitored and tested, APH says.

“The incident is a reminder of the vital importance of taking seriously the warnings of public health authorities on the risks of becoming infected with COVID-19 and spreading it to others,” UT spokesman JB Bird said in a statement.

Mexico, at the time, was not under a federal travel advisory for COVID-19, APH says.

[Data shows](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/43b91f7147934b0190119781f81aa896) that almost half of the people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in Austin-Travis County are between the ages 20-40, APH says."

The base case for forecasters is that a recovery, perhaps even a vigorous one, gets under way in the second half of 2020. But as the pandemic spreads through Europe and the Americas, and the wide range of knock-on effects comes into clearer view, caveats to that call are piling up.

relates to Economists Are Losing Hope in a ‘V-Shaped’ Post-Virus Recovery
Underlying all of them is the simple fact that economic outcomes hinge on something that’s beyond the professional competence of most economists to forecast: the trajectory of the disease itself.

“We have no certainty the virus will be gone by the end of the second quarter,” said Nobel prizewinner Joseph Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University in New York. If it “lasts through the summer, then all the effects will be amplified.”

Beyond that, there is an array of questions for economists to grapple with -- and those doubts increasingly undermine projections for what’s known as a “V-shaped recovery,” in which lost output is quickly restored.

Rather than sounding a decisive “all clear,” health authorities seem likely to advocate a gradual return to normal working life, so the behavior known as “social distancing” may stick around.

Along with financial blows sustained during the downturn, that is likely to damp spending on travel or spending at shops or restaurants -- assuming those businesses can stay afloat in the first place.

“It takes more time to get ‘back to play’ than to ‘get back to work’,” said Catherine Mann, chief economist at Citigroup Inc. This “underpins concerns for the trajectory for services-dependent advanced economies in the second half of 2020,” she said.

Central banks across the world have cut interest rates this year

Consumer caution is already evident in China, even though authorities say it’s safe to go back into the marketplace, and it could happen elsewhere.

That’s why Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, likens his forecast to a “Nike swoosh” rather than a V- or U-shaped rebound. He says U.S. output alone could plunge at an annualized pace of as much as 25% in the second quarter, bounce back by up to 15% in the third, then stall in the fourth with the economy “basically limping along.”

Much will depend on how fast businesses bring back jobs. The International Labor Organization warns 25 million positions may be shed, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said on Tuesday it expected U.S. unemployment to soar to 15%.

Mckinsey & Co. notes one quarter of U.S. households already live from paycheck to paycheck, and that 40% of Americans are unable to cover an unexpected expense of $400 without borrowing.

Stiglitz worries about what he calls “financial gridlock” in which households and companies can’t pay bills, forcing those they owe to into bankruptcy and default as well and so on.

That threat could be heightened by the scale of borrowing in recent years. The Institute of International Finance estimates household debt -- as a share of output -- is at record levels in several economies.

Who’s Borrowing?
In many countries, households didn’t delever after the financial crisis

Corporate borrowing has also hit a high in countries including France and the U.S. Those debts along with the collapse in earnings and slide in equities may limit the ability of companies to reboot after the crisis, with some also likely to be hurt by the collapse in oil prices.

“In any recovery, firms may need to sell shares or slash capex to reduce debt or repay government assistance,” said Charles Dumas of TS Lombard.

Keen to avoid an extended recession, policy makers have been taking emergency measures on a scale that likely exceeds even the response to the 2008 financial crisis. They’re extending credit lifelines to business, paying cash to households, and helping companies cover their wage bills so they don’t have to fire workers. Central banks have slashed interest rates and started new asset-purchase programs.

The strongest argument for a rapid recovery is what economists call “pent-up demand” -- a label that applies quite literally in the current crisis.

Economies shuddered to a halt when people were forced to hunker down at home, so there should be a corresponding upswing when they’re allowed out again -- especially with governments everywhere injecting cash to speed the process.

“Assuming the outbreak peaks by April/May, this will likely set the stage for a recovery in the second half of 2020,” said Chetan Ahya, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.

He predicts the global economy will contract 2.3% on an annualized basis in the first half of the year before growing 1.5% in the second half. Even that scenario means the U.S. and euro area won’t regain their pre-crisis levels of output until the third quarter of 2021.

Bond-Purchasing Programs
The coronavirus pandemic has driven more central banks to buy bonds


Source: Bloomberg

At JPMorgan Chase & Co., economists led by Bruce Kasman are citing emerging markets as another source of concern. They’re being pinched by gains in the dollar and the outflow of foreign-held capital, pushing up local borrowing costs.

The most encouraging virus news for economists at the moment comes from Asia, which suffered the first outbreaks but appears to have gotten them under a degree of control.

China is cranking back into action, with numbers released on Tuesday showing manufacturing activity rebounded strongly in March.

Demand in the domestic market is reviving, as lockdowns ease and consumers return to the shops or showrooms. Auto sales, for example, have been ticking higher for weeks, though they’re still down some 40% from last year’s level.

What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“If outbreaks in other countries follow the same trajectory, the world economy could be up and running again by the start of the second half. But that’s far from guaranteed. Past pandemics lasted years, not months. Scientists at Imperial College London are warning containment measures may have to stay in place for 18 months.”

-- Tom Orlik, chief economist. See {BECO <GO>}

International orders, though, may take longer to recover. Because other economies got hit later by the virus, they’re seeing a slump in demand for imports just as China’s export engine is revving up again. That feedback loop may undermine other recoveries too.

And in China, as in other countries, economics will continue to depend on epidemiology for some time to come. Even as overall progress is made toward containing the coronavirus and developing a vaccine, there’s no guarantee that the movement will be in one direction.

Instead there could be “aftershocks following the initial outbreak, with restrictions being re-imposed and lifted so as to manage the capacity of the healthcare system to cope,” said Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroder Investment Management. “In economic terms, this would lead to a double-dip recession.”

History also suggests reason to worry. A just-published study of pandemics and armed conflicts found such shocks typically weigh on wages and investment for years to come."

Today's data notes:

* People tested (+17,141) = 244,421 (0.65% of the population)
* Tested positive (+1144) = 8591 (3.51% of those tested). This is the 2nd day in a row where new positives jumped by more than 1000 cases. The hit ratio per total tested continues to climb a little from 3.28% to 3.51%, which is up from 2.51% a week ago. 
* Test backlog (-1963) = 10,683. 4th day in a row drop in backlog. ON dropped from 5651 to 4280. QC from 6200 to 5601.
* 12 deaths today, bringing the total to 101 deaths (1.18% of known positives - this is not really the mortality rate, since that won't be known until all those infected are recovered or not, and may vary significantly if the healthcare system is overwhelmed)
* Recovered = 1297 (15.1% of known positives).
* Known active = 7193 (Total positives - recovered - deceased). The unknowns are unknown. 
* Italy becomes the 2nd country to declare 100,000 CoVID-positive cases.
* The bump in China's number @ day 29 was due to a change in the way their cases were categorized.

Washington state adopted a Microsoft Corp. -backed law enshrining the most detailed regulations of facial recognition in the U.S., potentially serving as a model for other states as use of the technology grows.

Gov. Jay Inslee signed the law Tuesday allowing government agencies to use facial recognition, with restrictions designed to ensure it isn’t deployed for broad surveillance or tracking innocent people.

The law makes Washington’s policy stricter than many states that don’t have any laws governing the technology, but more permissive than at least seven U.S. municipalities that have blocked government from using it out of concerns about privacy violations and bias.

Passage of the law is a win for Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., near Seattle, and which had lobbied in favor of it. Cloud providers such as Microsoft and other technology firms see a multibillion-dollar opportunity as businesses and governments apply facial recognition to identify customers, solve crimes, control access to buildings and more. Proposed bans on the technology threaten that opportunity.

Other tech companies say they support regulation of facial recognition, but generally haven’t been as active as Microsoft in promoting legislation. Seattle-based cloud computing giant [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. has called for national standards but hasn’t said much publicly on the facial recognition law in its home state.

Facial recognition is going mainstream. The technology is increasingly used by law-enforcement agencies and in schools, casinos and retail stores, spurring privacy concerns. In this episode of Moving Upstream, WSJ’s Jason Bellini tests out the technology at an elementary school in Seattle and visits a company that claims its algorithm can identify potential terrorists by their facial features alone.

There are signs the Washington model is catching on in other states. Lawmakers in California, Maryland, South Dakota and Idaho introduced bills this year with text mirroring the Washington state bill, word-for-word in some sections, according to Quorum Analytics Inc., a software company that tracks legislation. Those bills haven’t advanced.

Microsoft has helped promote the legislation in other states. In Idaho, Republican State Rep. Britt Raybould modeled a facial-recognition proposal on a draft of the Washington bill she received from Microsoft after reaching out to the company, she said in an interview. “It’s a starting point,” she said of the Idaho bill.

In Hawaii, a lobbyist for Microsoft was circulating a draft of the Washington bill late last year, according to the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which says it received a copy from the lobbyist by email.

A Microsoft spokesman noted the company has been openly advocating for facial recognition regulations since 2018.

“Washington state’s new law breaks through what at times has been a polarizing debate,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a blog post Tuesday. “This balanced approach ensures that facial recognition can be used as a tool to protect the public, but only in ways that respect fundamental rights and serve the public interest.”

The idea of regulation didn’t catch on in Hawaii. Instead, lawmakers there were considering a moratorium on government use of facial recognition before postponing this year’s legislative session amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the new Washington law, if a government agency wants to use facial recognition, it has to first give public notice, hold at least three community meetings, and publish a report outlining the technology’s potential impact on civil liberties.

Police could use facial recognition for ongoing surveillance or real-time identification of people but they will need a warrant or court order first.

The law also includes checks on the technology. It can’t be used to make significant government decisions without “meaningful human review,” and government employees must be trained on the technology’s limitations.

&#x200B;

A company providing it to the government has to allow for independent third-party testing of the system, checking for accuracy or bias. Washington state Sen. Joe Nguyen, a Democrat and the bill’s main sponsor, said that provision has national implications because problems identified in his state will have to be fixed elsewhere, too. In addition to being a part-time legislator, Mr. Nguyen works as a senior program manager at Microsoft.

Some in Washington state have criticized the law. Jennifer Lee, technology and liberty project manager for the ACLU’s local chapter, says the bill gives the government too much leeway. She noted one provision that allows police to use the technology without a warrant if “exigent circumstances exist.”

“We need a temporary ban on face surveillance, not ongoing use that allows beta testing of face surveillance on the most impacted and vulnerable communities,” Ms. Lee said.

The Washington Association of Sheriffs & Police Chiefs also lobbied against the bill, saying it placed too many bureaucratic requirements on law enforcement agencies.

“There is a version of facial recognition regulations that we are okay with,” but this law “hinders our ability to keep people safe,” said James McMahan, the group’s policy director. He pointed to a requirement that police obtain a court order before a common use of facial recognition: Identifying a missing or deceased person.

As he signed the law, Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said it “provides state and local governments a set of guidelines around facial recognition technology while balancing the interests of law-enforcement, the business community and individuals’ right to privacy.”

- *2:30 p.m., Tuesday, March 31, 2020*

Two more deaths and 131 new COVID-19 cases were reported in San Diego County Tuesday, the largest single-day increase thus far, county health officials announced.

Those new cases now bring the total to 734, but Supervisor Nathan Fletcher warned the public not to read too much into the reporting because it can be “influenced by a series of things.”

“We’re still in the early days for the region,” he said. “There is so much we don’t know (such as how many actual cases and when virus spread will peak).”

The county's first case was reported about three weeks ago and the region has only been under a stay-at-home order for less than two weeks. Fletcher said he expects cases will rise as more people get tested.

“It will continue to rise in the foreseeable future,” he said.

There were also two more deaths and one probable death associated with the virus reported, county public health officer Dr. Wilma Wooten said. That brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus deaths to nine in the county.

The viral spread has not yet reached its peak in the San Diego region, she said.

Oregonians and visitors to our state should be aware most campgrounds and boat ramps are closed, so you should research your plans before recreating.

On one hand there are people who are doing really impressive things who would obviously be doing what they are doing without the support. In fact all of these people were doing what they were doing for years before they thought to go on the Internet about it. Cam Honan, Andrew Skurka, Anish, Legend, Dirtmonger, etc.

They realize they can use the Internet to get some modicum of financial support doing the things they love and I think it is great that they can manage to do that. Most of these people work seasonal jobs and make very little money from sponsorships or content but they make enough and enjoy writing about it enough that its worth it. There are also tons of people writing blogs who are obviously doing it to document what they are doing and just because they enjoy writing and love hiking, and aren't making anything at all.

Then there is another group of people. It seems all of them are vloggers. They all have titles like ""The 5 pieces of gear I would never leave home without"" or ""You'll be shocked to find out this secret about the PCT"".

They are never doing something interesting as far as hiking is concerned. It seems like half of these people are just setting up a tarp in their front yard or doing a conventional thru hike. Nothing wrong with doing a conventional thru hike, but I don't understand how that is interesting enough to people to turn you into a quasi celebrity and actually make a living on. Hiking the AT in 5 months is not exceptionally impressive or interesting. It's like reality TV or something.

My strong suspicion is that the vloggers that actually get tens or hundreds of thousands of views have viewers who are not actually thru hikers. Last year on the PCT there was definitely a type of person who had watched a ton of these videos. Usually much older guys with no backpacking experience.

As nice as it is for more people to be getting outside it sucks watching the bigger trails become commercialized, especially by people that are just trying to get famous and aren't actually doing anything worth being famous for.

Covid-19 is a contraction of ""Corona Virus Disease 2019""."

The experiments have also shown that hamsters – which have enzyme receptors similar to those in humans – can recover from the coronavirus if they are strong enough to survive the first seven days after onset. The findings come to light as Hong Kong faces a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases, with the tally of infected rising to 714 on Tuesday, with four fatalities. The virus has infected more than 771,000 worldwide and killed over 36,000.

Led by top microbiologist Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, researchers from the Department of Microbiology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) began to use golden Syrian hamsters for testing in February, based on the high similarity between the “ACE2 protein” in hamsters and that in humans. ACE2, or Angiotensin converting enzyme 2, is the host cell receptor responsible for the novel coronavirus. Yuen’s team determined the similarity between species when they saw that ACE2 in hamsters, as in humans, had a high binding affinity to the “spike protein” found in the coronavirus."

2020-03-31,McRioT,CoronavirusCA,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/fspsa2/california_classrooms_not_expected_to_reopen_this/fm2vd78/,"California schools will be unable to reopen this year given current safety concerns and ongoing social distancing, the state superintendent told county officials Tuesday.

	

The letter, obtained by The Chronicle, was not a directive, but rather an acknowledgment that the still growing coronavirus crisis means schools should stay shuttered.

	 	

While classrooms should remain closed, education will continue, Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said.

	

“Due to the current safety concerns and needs for ongoing social distancing it currently appears that our students will not be able to return to school campuses before the end of the school year,” Thurmond said. “This is in no way to suggest that school is over for the year, but rather we should put all efforts into strengthening our delivery of education through distance learning.”

	

The memo was the guidance local districts had been waiting for to make the hard call to close schools for the year, education officials said.

	

“That provides a little more clarity for school leaders,” said Troy Flint, spokesman for the California School Boards Association. “I think a lot of school districts and certain county superintendents have been leaning in this direction, but have been waiting on something more definitive from the state to give them security in making this decision.”

	 	 	

Flint said he expects local school boards to begin making announcements of school-year closures based on Thurmond’s letter.

	

Ending speculation will allow districts to focus on distance learning, distributing school meals and providing other support without having to worry about whether schools will resume at an uncertain date, Flint said.

	 	

While Thurmond’s memo wasn’t a mandate, it was a call to action, for district’s to plan to do distance learning the rest of the year, said Alameda County Superintendent Karen Monroe.

	

“Every week is a new set of realities,” she said. “Once you say that (closing) is for sure, you better be able to say what is happening.”

	

Earlier this month, district officials across the Bay Area closed schools to combat the coronvirus, with most expecting to reopen in early April. Two weeks later, most extended that to May 4. Thurmond's guidance effectively gives districts the backing to make the decision to end speculation or hope that schools will reopen.

	

District officials in recent days said there was a sense that a year-ending closure was inevitable and they were hoping the state would make the call sooner rather than later.

		 	

“I think our leadership team would be thankful for that guidance,” said San Francisco school board President Mark Sanchez earlier Tuesday.

	

For the moment, however, San Francisco and many other districts are still officially scheduled to reopen May 4.

	

“The state superintendent did suggest that schools may stay closed for the rest of the year but the state has not issued a directive,” said San Francisco district spokeswoman Gentle Blythe. “SFUSD’s superintendent continues to work with other superintendents, the SF Board of Education and health officials to monitor the situation and will update families and staff if the closure timeline.”

	

It will still be up to each district to officially announce the decision to not reopen, but Thurmond’s letter offers a statewide perspective and backing for what is already an unprecedented shutdown of state schools.

	 	

“We know that we are dealing with a never seen before health crisis that challenges us in many ways,” Thurmond said. “But we also believe that as it relates to educating California students we must rise to meet that challenge, that we are stronger together, and that if we work together we can do more together for all of our students.”"

However, considering all countries all far behind in testing with except maybe Germany and South Korea, I think it’s fine if we compare it by deaths per infected.

But the point is that this graph is completely flawed. It’s purpose is to correlate deaths in countries with universal health system against our own. However this implies that the healthcare being free is the culprit, not the fact the government of Italy, and also socioeconomic factors of Italy, caused 1. A very latent response 2. A greater spread because of Italian Business with China. You should instead compare region by region. Like New York and California to Lombardy and Lazio. Both are/ about to become over capacity, and both have thousands of doctors and nurses coming out of retirement to help coronavirus patients. That is a fair comparison for efficiency of a private healthcare system vs a universal one.

You can’t blame a universal health care system for increased deaths when thousands of workers have come out of retirement, the government has built multiple hospitals and testing being hard for the entire world to come across."

If your opinion has been disproven countless times by thousands of independent people and even accidentally by your own sides, has been shown to be false over decades of practical use and would actually lead to more harm, it's simply an opinion that shouldn't be allowed to be entertained or taken seriously.

Edit: Dear lord it's a lot worse than I thought. At first I thought ""huh, that's not bad, I wonder what the fuss is all about"" and then I started scrolling down and things just took a wild left. 7 posts in and somebody makes the conspiracy that COVID-19 is just a distraction to keep us from noticing that the army in several nations is being mobilized (what for?

But let's not let my aversion to Fox News and its proud to be ignorant, know-nothing audience be my main rebuttal here. 

What do actual scientists who study genomes of viruses say about the origins of SARS-COV-2?  

From the Journal of Nature Medicine: 

""It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone.

 Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage could have given rise to SARS-CoV-2.""

Bibi is not a secular leader. He is the leader of an ultra orthodox coalition, and he would stop at nothing to further his religious agenda. That's why he's so busy finding who leaks info from meetings, but does nothing to find covid-19 carriers.

If they are to be believed, before the coronavirus everything economically speaking was going swimmingly as well. But in reality debt has grown to insurmountable quantities & risk has been building in the financial system for some time. Now with COVID-19 on the landscape just beneath the surface is a developing global finacial crisis 2.0 courtesy of a domestic supply shock & international demand shock combing to force a credit shock. By design all the US dollar financial plumbing of the world leads back to the United States (USD recycling). This wasn't so bad when things are good & the world's economy is growing, but the inverse is also true & will be devastating for the growth only model of economics the world is currently designed around.

It's worrisome that you had so so much unprotected sex that you concluded that one of you must be sterile. 

Were you trying to have a baby? Has he been your only sex partner? How old are you guys? Is there an age gap between you and your partner?

It seems you did not have adequate sex ed. 

This website is a great resource. 

https://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexual-health

People who have a cycle can only get pregnant a few days a month. 

At the most fertile time the highest chance is still only 30%. In the rest of the fertile window it's only 10%

https://www.yourfertility.org.au/everyone/timing

So every time he cums in you, you have a 70-90% chance of not being pregnant. But have enough sex and you will eventually get pregnant for sure. 

If you're not having a normal cycle this makes pregnancy more  unlikely.

I wouldn't tell him. I would fear he would try to push you into having it. You are breaking up anyway. Just get the abortion.


I'm 2A and a supporter of the stand your ground laws because I feel you always have the right to use lethal force to defend yourself with no duty to retreat. Which also leads me to believe that a someone always has the right to defend their body from the trauma of pregnancy.

In no other situation are you forced to use your body to sustain the life of another.

In no other situation are you mandated to let someone cause you serious harm.

No one should be allowed to use your body against your will.

I feel you always have the right to defend your body from harm so I view abortion as justified homicide."

Kemp has announced an upcoming [surge in testing](https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/georgia-announces-surge-coming-coronavirus-testing/JX1HzKYvQ1NKd1la0wC9MO/).

Gov. Brian Kemp’s office and the state’s public colleges and universities on Tuesday announced plans to dramatically increase coronavirus testing capacity in Georgia by some 3,000 tests per day.


The state has obtained equipment and testing supplies to expand capabilities and will begin ramping up as soon as today, according to a news release, with fuller capacities expected online within five to seven days.A shortage of kits and other testing supplies and lab processing capacity has resulted in rationing of coronavirus tests throughout Georgia and across the nation.Limited testing — both statewide and across the country — has hampered the U.S. response to COVID-19, denying the nation’s public health agencies and elected leaders invaluable data showing how prevalent the virus is and where it’s moving, health experts said.The announcement is a partnership between the state, the University System of Georgia, Emory University and the state’s Department of Public Health.The news release said Georgia universities will transfer equipment for testing from labs to accredited labs at Georgia State, Augusta University, Emory and the state’s public health lab.


“Adequate testing for COVID-19 has continued to be a top priority for the Coronavirus Task Force as we fight this pandemic,” Kemp said in a news release. “With this innovative partnership between state government agencies, our world-class research institutions, and private-sector partners, we will be able to dramatically increase testing capacity. We hope this surge capacity plan will allow federal and state public health officials to gain a more complete picture of COVID-19’s impact on Georgia and better inform our collective decisions going forward.”As of Tuesday at noon, state and commercial laboratories have only processed fewer than 16,181 tests of Georgians, and health systems and patients have complained to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of prolonged waits to get results.

So far, Georgia’s public health agencies and health systems have rationed tests for the very sick, vulnerable people such as those who live in nursing homes and emergency workers.It’s unclear whether that will change, despite this announcement."

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization for the test which uses antibodies in blood to test for current or past infection. The tests have a 91% clinical specificity rate and a 99% clinical sensitivity rate. Results are delivered on site in as fast as two minutes. This is a game changer as today in the United States, most COVID-19 testing results take between two to seven days.

The test can be administered as easy as a glucose test but is designed strictly for use by medical professionals.

“When we realized we had the ability to step up and fight this pandemic at a critical point, we focused all our resources on bringing the rapid test kits, masks and other critical supplies to the front lines as soon as possible.” said Charlton E. Lui, Chief Executive Officer of BODYSPHERE. Lui continued, “Thankfully, when our perpetual quest for improving health put us in a position to deliver this lifesaving product – it became quite clear what we had to do.”

The test kits have been used successfully in several states where large roll outs are planned to combat the spread of the virus. BODYSPHERE is working closely with federal agencies and states to quickly deploy test kits across the country to hospitals, urgent care and emergency rooms.

“I’m not yet confident in advocating overweight risk assets positions because you’re vulnerable in that scenario to a deterioration of the news on the medical front,” said Hugh Gimber, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, in a phone interview. “The policy measures have helped but they’re not on their own enough for us to call a definitive bottom in this market.”


While global equities rallied last week and on Monday amid optimism that fiscal and monetary support measures can limit the fallout from the pandemic, the situation around the virus remains critical and companies are continuing to slash their earnings outlooks. The full extent of damage to corporate profits remains unknown, making it dangerous to turn risk-on, Gimber said.

Investors mull whether the equity sell-off has reached its floor
The strategist at the $1.9 trillion asset manager is closely monitoring the strength of the labor market in the U.S. and Europe for signs of how quickly the economies will be able to rebound once lockdown measures are lifted. This data can provide a signal to resume buying equities, he said.

During these challenging times, Gimber recommends focusing on quality companies with strong balance sheets and low leverage both in stocks and bonds.

“You want to be investing in companies that have the balance sheet flexibility to be able to handle this short-term hit to activity and come out on the other side the strongest,” he said.

In the bond market, he favors government debt with shorter duration over debt with a longer-term maturity as he sees the gains there as more limited. He’s particularly keen on investment-grade bonds that benefit from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s and other central banks’ purchases and support measures.

He’s much more cautious on high-yield debt issued by companies with weaker balance sheets. “The central banks will help solve the liquidity challenge for corporates, but they can’t help to solve the solvency issue for those more under-pressure names,” Gimber said.

Still, the current level of high-yield bond spreads offers a good entry opportunity for those looking to invest for one or two years because in the short-term, volatility can be significant, he said.

U.S. equities advanced on Tuesday after economic data topped estimates and 10-year Treasuries climbed. Still, coronavirus remained at the top of investors’ minds as Spain suffered its deadliest day of the pandemic, and European governments doubled down on efforts to maintain rigid lockdowns.

The base case for forecasters is that a recovery, perhaps even a vigorous one, gets under way in the second half of 2020. But as the pandemic spreads through Europe and the Americas, and the wide range of knock-on effects comes into clearer view, caveats to that call are piling up.

relates to Economists Are Losing Hope in a ‘V-Shaped’ Post-Virus Recovery Underlying all of them is the simple fact that economic outcomes hinge on something that’s beyond the professional competence of most economists to forecast: the trajectory of the disease itself.

“We have no certainty the virus will be gone by the end of the second quarter,” said Nobel prizewinner Joseph Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University in New York. If it “lasts through the summer, then all the effects will be amplified.”

Read More: Economists See U.S. Facing Worst-Ever Quarterly Contraction

Beyond that, there is an array of questions for economists to grapple with -- and those doubts increasingly undermine projections for what’s known as a “V-shaped recovery,” in which lost output is quickly restored.

Rather than sounding a decisive “all clear,” health authorities seem likely to advocate a gradual return to normal working life, so the behavior known as “social distancing” may stick around.

Along with financial blows sustained during the downturn, that is likely to damp spending on travel or spending at shops or restaurants -- assuming those businesses can stay afloat in the first place.

“It takes more time to get ‘back to play’ than to ‘get back to work’,” said Catherine Mann, chief economist at Citigroup Inc. This “underpins concerns for the trajectory for services-dependent advanced economies in the second half of 2020,” she said.

Global Easing in 2020 Central banks across the world have cut interest rates this year

Source: Bloomberg

Note: Map shows rate decisions since the start of the year

Consumer caution is already evident in China, even though authorities say it’s safe to go back into the marketplace, and it could happen elsewhere.

That’s why Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, likens his forecast to a “Nike swoosh” rather than a V- or U-shaped rebound. He says U.S. output alone could plunge at an annualized pace of as much as 25% in the second quarter, bounce back by up to 15% in the third, then stall in the fourth with the economy “basically limping along.”

Much will depend on how fast businesses bring back jobs. The International Labor Organization warns 25 million positions may be shed, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said on Tuesday it expected U.S. unemployment to soar to 15%.

Mckinsey & Co. notes one quarter of U.S. households already live from paycheck to paycheck, and that 40% of Americans are unable to cover an unexpected expense of $400 without borrowing.

Stiglitz worries about what he calls “financial gridlock” in which households and companies can’t pay bills, forcing those they owe to into bankruptcy and default as well and so on.

That threat could be heightened by the scale of borrowing in recent years. The Institute of International Finance estimates household debt -- as a share of output -- is at record levels in several economies.

Who’s Borrowing? In many countries, households didn’t delever after the financial crisis

Source: Bank for International Settlements

Corporate borrowing has also hit a high in countries including France and the U.S. Those debts along with the collapse in earnings and slide in equities may limit the ability of companies to reboot after the crisis, with some also likely to be hurt by the collapse in oil prices.

“In any recovery, firms may need to sell shares or slash capex to reduce debt or repay government assistance,” said Charles Dumas of TS Lombard.

Keen to avoid an extended recession, policy makers have been taking emergency measures on a scale that likely exceeds even the response to the 2008 financial crisis. They’re extending credit lifelines to business, paying cash to households, and helping companies cover their wage bills so they don’t have to fire workers. Central banks have slashed interest rates and started new asset-purchase programs.

Read more: Understanding Recessions as World Heads Into One: QuickTake

The strongest argument for a rapid recovery is what economists call “pent-up demand” -- a label that applies quite literally in the current crisis.

Economies shuddered to a halt when people were forced to hunker down at home, so there should be a corresponding upswing when they’re allowed out again -- especially with governments everywhere injecting cash to speed the process.

“Assuming the outbreak peaks by April/May, this will likely set the stage for a recovery in the second half of 2020,” said Chetan Ahya, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.

He predicts the global economy will contract 2.3% on an annualized basis in the first half of the year before growing 1.5% in the second half. Even that scenario means the U.S. and euro area won’t regain their pre-crisis levels of output until the third quarter of 2021.

Bond-Purchasing Programs The coronavirus pandemic has driven more central banks to buy bonds

Source: Bloomberg

At JPMorgan Chase & Co., economists led by Bruce Kasman are citing emerging markets as another source of concern. They’re being pinched by gains in the dollar and the outflow of foreign-held capital, pushing up local borrowing costs.

The most encouraging virus news for economists at the moment comes from Asia, which suffered the first outbreaks but appears to have gotten them under a degree of control.

China is cranking back into action, with numbers released on Tuesday showing manufacturing activity rebounded strongly in March.

Demand in the domestic market is reviving, as lockdowns ease and consumers return to the shops or showrooms. Auto sales, for example, have been ticking higher for weeks, though they’re still down some 40% from last year’s level.

What Bloomberg’s Economists Say... “If outbreaks in other countries follow the same trajectory, the world economy could be up and running again by the start of the second half. But that’s far from guaranteed. Past pandemics lasted years, not months. Scientists at Imperial College London are warning containment measures may have to stay in place for 18 months.”

-- Tom Orlik, chief economist. See {BECO <GO>}

International orders, though, may take longer to recover. Because other economies got hit later by the virus, they’re seeing a slump in demand for imports just as China’s export engine is revving up again. That feedback loop may undermine other recoveries too.

And in China, as in other countries, economics will continue to depend on epidemiology for some time to come. Even as overall progress is made toward containing the coronavirus and developing a vaccine, there’s no guarantee that the movement will be in one direction.

Instead there could be “aftershocks following the initial outbreak, with restrictions being re-imposed and lifted so as to manage the capacity of the healthcare system to cope,” said Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroder Investment Management. “In economic terms, this would lead to a double-dip recession.”

History also suggests reason to worry. A just-published study of pandemics and armed conflicts found such shocks typically weigh on wages and investment for years to come."

The Navy will not receive any new recruits at its boot camp (for this week only) in Great Lakes, Illinois, after one recruit tested positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), said Cmdr. David Hecht, a spokesman for the Chief of Naval Personnel.

""There are no recruits that will be showing up this week,"" Hecht told Task & Purpose on Monday. ""They will be moved to next week, and from there the arrival of recruits will continue on schedule.""

All new Navy recruits have been asked to restrict their movements for two weeks before shipping to Great Lakes, Hecht said. Each recruit will have his or her health and temperature checked before shipping to Great Lakes.

The recruits will then be quarantined at Great Lakes for two weeks before beginning their training.

São perguntas muito importantes sim, mas nada disto muda um simples fato: A disseminação do Corona vai colocar pessoas em hospitais que sem a existência do mesmo não estariam ali. Dada a virulência deste patógeno, existe um sério risco de colapso do sistema de saúde, o que significa um aumento generalizado na mortalidade de outras doenças e não somente dos infectados. 

Poucos países do mundo estão dispostos a arcar com o custo social das mortes, quiçá com o custo político de inação. Devemos sim aumentar nosso conhecimento sobre a pandemia para melhor desenvolver estratégias de combate, mas não vejo esse vídeo como algo que sustente as ideias absurdas da extrema-direita nacional."

Australia on the other hand, forces travellers to self isolate for 14 days.  There's a good reason for that - the virus is very easily transmitted between travellers.  Our govt is very lax on the whole coronavirus situation and there will be consequences in the next weeks/months.

   If it were me, I'd isolate your brother as much as possible from everyone else- keep him to his room, deliver his meals etc, assume everything is infected and take all precautions - have him shower/bathroom last and clean every time, and all of you start a 14 day isolation from when he gets home.  Better safe than sorry.  A healthy 13 year old kid died today in the UK."

In my opinion idk when the album will come but it’ll probably depend when all this coronavirus is over. I’m hoping by July things can go  back to normal but maybe G can drop the album in June or July then go on tour a few months after that. 

Also I feel like artists are going to wait a little bit longer to go on tour because even if we can go back to normal I bet  a lot of people will still be afraid to go out so that’ll mean less ticket. Artists won’t want that"

I'm in NYC, and so many of my friends, classmates, and co-workers have ""fled"" the city for second homes, or gone to family in other states. Even though I couldn't even have been ""with"" them if they had stayed, I feel abandoned.  
I hate seeing people on social media posting from their suburban home in like, Kansas that make self-isolation look like a cat-cuddling, gourmet-meal-cooking staycation when I can't even find flour in the grocery store.   
I hate seeing advertisements for products or services with a coronavirus ""spin"" on them (""you can use this THING now that you have so much downtime!"") when my friends have lost their jobs because of this and are in no position to go shopping.  
I don't even feel better watching Cuomo's shtick every day because it seems like we are always begging for the same number of ventilators. It feels like no help is coming.  
My anxiety has been pretty level but I feel like my temper is fraying. I worry that I'll never be pleasant to be around again. Sorry if this was just a long, negative rant."
