The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu. 

 1. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)] . 

 2. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)] . This makes it much more difficult to control. 

 3. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)].

 4. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)] .

 5. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots. 

 6. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21). 

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. 

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. 

This virus is potentially devastating if containment measures fail. Far worse than the seasonal flu."

The workers did not show symptoms of infection and were not tested for the virus, according to lawyers for the whistleblower, who is a senior HHS official based in Washington who oversees workers at the Administration for Children and Families, a unit within HHS.
The whistleblower is seeking federal protection because she alleges she was unfairly and improperly reassigned after raising concerns about the safety of these workers to HHS officials, including those within the office of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. She was told Feb. 19 that if she does not accept the new position in 15 days, which is March 5, she would be terminated.

The whistleblower has decades of experience in the field, received two HHS department awards from Azar last year, and has received the highest performance evaluations.”"

Different departments had different cultures and different internal rules.  The NYPD patrol man's guide is like 2 gigantic loose leaf binders.  There were plenty ways of getting jammed up.  I remember my intructor at the academy pointing at the binders and said, ""In 1970 that was 30 pages.  Everytime a cop has fucked up since then, a different paragraph is added.""

IAB will get the complaint (perhaps contact them directly to file the complaint?) and call in the officer in and order the officer to explain his version of the events.  If the claim is a serious rule break, the officer can have a PBA lawyer with him.  If the officer lies at this interview, he will be fired, no matter what the original complaint was for.  Once he gives his version, the investigation begins.  

At this point if they find the officer broke internal rules, he will be brought up on charges and specs at a trial.  These charges and specs penalties can range 1 vacation day removed from the officer up to suspension for certain amount of months and/or returning on modified duty.  The modified duty lasts until he is called to where he can fight or plead guilty and take the hits.  FYI losing your service weapon was an automatic 30 day vacation day hit.

As you can see, its not a simple process.  Different departments will have different procedures and rules.  Ranging from none (hi we're a 5 person police dept in the middle of no where) to the in depth procedures you just read about (NYPD).

Lots of vitriol, lots of angst. 

But not a single call for violence against anyone who works for reddit, nor leftists in general. 

I browsed politics and politicalhumor for ten minutes each. I have found two direct death threats against Trump supporters, one direct threat against the President involving Coronavirus, and one straight up as clear as day ""k177 the President"". 

None of them have been removed after a few hours. I linked five different posts last night from politics with death threats on a highqualitygif post. now that sub has gone private and the moderators are absolute dickheads. None of the posts I linked last night have been removed, but I can't even see my posts from last night because that sub is private. I was challenged to find instances of calls for violence in a ""left"" sub, it took me LITERALLY 45 seconds. Of course, no one responded, they just downvoted me to auto-hide status, then made sure no trump supporters could post there. 

What the fuck. I get it. People hate Trump. But how can they deny this isn't blatant butthurt over political opinions? If anything, this is perfect proof that propaganda works, because once again everyone on every other subreddit is saying stuff like ""oh well, the donald has like ten times as much violence and rule breaking that any other sub"" and that's just clearly not the case.

2020-02-27,Taellion,Coronavirus,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fa7lu2/need_help_explaining_why_this_is_more_serious/fiwezbk/,"The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu. 

 1. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)] . 

 2. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)] . This makes it much more difficult to control. 

 3. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)].

 4. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)] .

 5. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots. 

 6. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21). 

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. 

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. 

This virus is potentially devastating if containment measures fail. Far worse than the seasonal flu.

2020-02-27,Jesenjin,Coronavirus,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/faj5r7/us_workers_without_protective_gear_assisted/fiyg0oz/,"Asked whether any protocols may have been broken, given the urgency on the ground, Azar replied that urgency was never a reason for breaking safety protocols.

“I don’t believe that has taken place,” Azar said said, adding that health and safety protocols “should always be followed.” He said that he did not personally know the names of the team, but that other department officials did. Pressed by Gomez what the department would do if untrained employees were exposed to the virus, Azar said: “I’d want to know the full facts, and we’d take appropriate remedial efforts.”

The whistleblower said she received an email Jan. 25 about a potential deployment within ACF to support repatriation of the evacuated Americans, according to her lawyer. She initially supported the efforts because they had the “appearance that this was within ACF’s scope,” lawyer Lauren Naylor said. But later, she discovered the personnel were dispatched without her knowledge by other senior officials at HHS. It was part of the agency’s “all-hands-on-deck” mission, Naylor said, but it broke agency protocol about what kinds of employees should respond to health emergencies. The whistleblower said she later found out about the deployment when she heard directly from some employees and other senior officials at HHS.

Some workers [expressed concern about the lack of protective gear](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/shortages-confusion-and-poor-communication-complicate-coronavirus-preparations/2020/02/25/d9e56396-575d-11ea-9b35-def5a027d470_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_33&itid=lk_inline_manual_33) to the ACF team leader on the ground. That person joined ACF in September and had “no training or experience in any federal emergency management, public health emergency response, or safety or operational protocols to run the mission,” the complaint states.

ACF personnel typically deal with supporting people recovering from natural disasters, such as floods and fires, and helping victims apply for temporary assistance, all of which are under the category of human services, the whistleblower’s lawyers said. HHS officials broke established protocols for emergency support by sending ACF workers to a health emergency, for which they have no training, Naylor said. The Administration for Children and Families, which has about 1,300 employees, [has come under attack in recent years because of its role in sheltering and taking custody of migrant children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/ig-trump-administration-took-thousands-more-migrant-children-from-parents/2019/01/17/c05f51e6-19c6-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_34&itid=lk_inline_manual_34) who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border who were separated from them by the Department of Homeland Security.

The workers’ concerns were not addressed, the whistleblower’s lawyers said.

“She was involuntarily assigned to a position in a subject matter where she has no expertise,” said Wilkenfeld, her lawyer, in an interview Thursday. The agency said the reason for the reassignment was “necessary to meet the needs of the department,” according to a memo she received. “If I did not accept involuntary reassignment, I would be terminated from federal service through adverse personnel action,” according to her complaint.

Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sent more than a dozen workers to [receive the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/world/plane-arrives-in-california-from-wuhan/2020/01/29/b20abf1a-c7a0-481d-8adf-db7141b1fae6_video.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&itid=lk_inline_manual_2) without proper training for infection control or appropriate protective gear, according to a whistleblower complaint.

The workers did not show symptoms of infection and were not [tested for the virus,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/25/cdc-coronavirus-test/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3) according to lawyers for the whistleblower, who is a senior HHS official based in Washington who oversees workers at the Administration for Children and Families, a unit within HHS.

The whistleblower is seeking federal protection because she alleges she was unfairly and improperly reassigned after raising concerns about the safety of these workers to HHS officials, including those within the office of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. She was told Feb. 19 that if she does not accept the new position in 15 days, which is March 5, she would be terminated.

The whistleblower has decades of experience in the field, received two HHS department awards from Azar last year, and has received the highest performance evaluations, her lawyers said.

The complaint was filed Wednesday with the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal watchdog agency. The whistleblower’s lawyers provided a copy of a redacted 24-page complaint to The Washington Post. A spokesman for the Office of the Special Counsel said he could not comment on complaints filed with the office.

The complaint alleges that HHS staff were “improperly deployed” and were “not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation.” The complaint also alleges that the workers were [potentially exposed to coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-updates/2020/02/22/72dd19de-54ea-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_9&itid=lk_inline_manual_9) because appropriate steps were not taken to protect them, and staff were not trained in wearing personal protective equipment, even though they had face-to-face contact with returning passengers. The workers were in contact with passengers in an airplane hangar where evacuees were received and on two other occasions: when they helped distribute keys for room assignments and hand out colored ribbons for identification purposes.

“We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act. We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time,” HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said.

In her complaint, the whistleblower states that “appropriate steps were not taken to quarantine, monitor, or test \[the workers\] during their deployment and upon their return home.” The repatriated Americans were [among those evacuated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-americans/2020/02/20/b6f54cae-5279-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_13&itid=lk_inline_manual_13) from Wuhan and [quarantined on military bases in California and Texas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/for-americans-a-nightmare-escaping-wuhan-then-14-days-of-quarantine/2020/02/05/d303daca-4859-11ea-8124-0ca81effcdfb_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_13&itid=lk_inline_manual_13) because they were considered at high risk for contracting the flu-like illness.

About 14 ACF personnel were sent to March Air Force base in Riverside County, California, and another team of about 13 ACF personnel were sent to Travis Air Force in Fairfield, California, according to the complaint and the whistleblower’s lawyer, Ari Wilkenfeld. Several people within HHS voiced objection to sending the ACF personnel to receive passengers, according to a person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.

A second person familiar with the situation said the workers were not tested for coronavirus because none of them met the criteria for testing, which only calls for testing people who had recent travel to China or contact with a confirmed case. The workers also did not exhibit any symptoms, the person said. If they had, appropriate protocol would have been followed.

The deployments took place Jan. 28 to 31, around the time when the first planeload of evacuees arrived at March, and Feb. 2 to Feb. 7, during the time when additional flights were arriving at Travis. The planes each carried about 200 Americans who were repatriated from Wuhan.

After their deployments, the workers returned to their normal duties, some taking commercial airline flights to return to their offices around the country, the lawyers said.

“Our client was concerned that ACF staff — who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus — were allowed to leave quarantined areas and return to their communities, where they may have spread the coronavirus to others,” said Lauren Naylor, one of the whistleblower’s lawyers.

The whistleblower is also seeking assistance from the office of Rep. Jimmy Gomez, (D-Ca.), a member of the House Ways and Means committee and vice chair of the House Oversight Committee, according to a Gomez spokesman.

During a hearing Thursday, Gomez asked Azar whether any employees from the Administration for Children and Families could have been sent to help with the repatriation of Americans from Wuhan, China without any training in emergency response. Azar replied that some ACF employees were involved.

Asked what sort of health and safety training the personnel received, and whether any of them were exposed to high-risk evacuees from China, Azar said: “They never should have been without P.P.E,” referring to personal protective equipment.

1. The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28\[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)\] .

What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.
2. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%\[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)\] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%\[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)\] .
3. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms\[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)\] . This makes it much more difficult to control.
4. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention\[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)\] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu\[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)\].
5. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month\[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)\] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days\[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)\] .
6. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2\[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)\] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.
7. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. *See*, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21).

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations.

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention."

Hospital s will be saved for vulnerable groups, particularly elderly and immunosuppressed, and those that get really sick. Samples can be taken and tested later. The mortality rate appears kinda low, obviously still high but the majority of people on the planet are probably going to be infected and not die.

The tests will be a formality at some point, if someone shows up with symptoms it's just gonna be assumed to be coronavirus because everyone else has it. There's no point testing if everyone is quarantined"

There's only so many ways you can spin the actual number of cases. And spinning fatalities isn't going to work. Trump will try but most of America won't believe him. ""A guy died. Could be coronavirus. Or maybe he had a bad heart. People die. Bad genes.""

I bet in about a month Trump says ""Mike hasn't done good on the coronavirus thing. I'm not saying I'm looking for another vice president. *We'll see what happens.*""

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8k2nj/why\_sarscov2\_is\_not\_just\_the\_flu\_with\_sources/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8k2nj/why_sarscov2_is_not_just_the_flu_with_sources/)

1. The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28\[[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-may-spread-faster-than-who-estimate#Higher-estimates-than-WHO-predict)\] . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3\[[2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/)\] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signficantly faster than the seasonal flu.
2. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%\[[3](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029/5735509)\] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%\[[4](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-already-killed-10000-across-us-as-world-frets-over-coronavirus.html)\] .
3. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms\[[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028)\] . This makes it much more difficult to control.
4. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention\[[6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says#80.9%-of-the-cases-are-mild)\] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu\[[7](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)\].
5. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month\[[8](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260020300795.pdf)\] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days\[[9](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/flu_in_adults/article_em.htm)\] .
6. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2\[[10](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)\] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.
7. There is no [herd immunity](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/herd-immunity-how-does-it-work) for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. *See*, for example, a [Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people](https://twitter.com/covid_19news/status/1231581727438467072?s=21).

Now, consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations.

These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medicalintervention.

There have been reported cases of ""re-infection"", but it is unclear if these cases are due to actually catching the coronavirus again, or if they are getting discharged too early due to a false negative, or competition for hospital beds.

The PCR test used is notorious for false negatives. People that are sick may not express enough virus where they are swabbed to register a positive. That's why they are swabbed in multiple places. Unfortunately there is no easy way to swab the lungs, where it really matters. After a couple of false negatives you are ""recovered"" and sent home.

Also there are reports that people that are still recovering, but are improved, are getting kicked out of the hospital in China to make space for sicker patients. Some of these ""recovered"" patients relapse and get worse again."

I'm in Austin and South By Southwest is coming to town in a couple of weeks, which has a ton of international travelers. I'm traveling to Chicago during that time, which is increased risk, and who knows what will be waiting for me when I get back to town after SXSW.

2020-02-27,Kinmok,bayarea,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/fajsdf/us_health_workers_responding_to_coronavirus/fiz0cxj/," WASHINGTON — Federal health employees interacted with Americans quarantined for possible exposure to the [coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps.html) without proper medical training or protective gear, then scattered into the general population, according to a government whistle-blower.

In a portion of a complaint filing obtained by The New York Times that has been submitted to the Office of the Special Counsel, the whistle-blower, described as a senior leader at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the team was “improperly deployed” to two military bases in California to assist the processing of Americans who had been evacuated from coronavirus hot zones in China and elsewhere.

The staff members were sent to Travis Air Force Base and March Air Reserve Base and were ordered to enter quarantined areas, including a hangar where coronavirus evacuees were being received. They were not provided training in safety protocols until five days later, the person said.

Without proper training or equipment, some of the exposed staff members moved freely around and off the bases, with at least one person staying in a nearby hotel and leaving California on a commercial flight. Many were unaware of the need to test their temperature three times a day.

 

“I soon began to field panicked calls from my leadership team and deployed staff members expressing concerns with the lack of H.H.S. communication and coordination, staff being sent into quarantined areas without personal protective equipment, training or experience in managing public health emergencies, safety protocols and the potential danger to both themselves and members of the public they come into contact with,” the whistle-blower wrote.

In a statement on Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged the complaint without elaborating.

“We take all whistle-blower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act,” said Caitlin B. Oakley, deputy assistant secretary and a national spokeswoman for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs. “We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time.”

 

The account surfaced after President Trump [sought to play down the danger](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html) of a domestic coronavirus outbreak amid bipartisan concern about a sluggish and disjointed response by the administration to an illness that public health officials have said is likely to spread through the United States. The first American case of coronavirus in a patient with no known contact with hot zones or other coronavirus patients emerged near Travis Air Force Base this week.

The whistle-blower’s account raised questions about whether the Trump administration has taken adequate precautions in its handling of the virus to date, and whether Mr. Trump’s minimization of the risks has been mirrored by other top officials when confronted with potentially disturbing developments.

 

Similar episodes appear to have happened elsewhere. Employees with the Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families were also dispatched to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to help other evacuees from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, someone with direct knowledge of the effort said.

It was the first time to his knowledge that employees of the family administration had ever dealt with a federal quarantine. Employees of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention appeared to have one set of guidance. Other employees of the Health and Human Services Department operated under a different protocol.

The levels of protection varied even while he was at Miramar, he said. Standards were more lax at first, but once people arrived who appeared to be sick, workers began donning personal protective equipment. He is now back at work, and has yet to be tested for coronavirus exposure.

In the complaint, the whistle-blower painted a grim portrait of agency staff members who found themselves on the front lines of a frantic federal effort to confront the coronavirus in the United States without any preparation or training, and whose own health concerns were dismissed by senior administration officials as detrimental to staff “morale.” They were “admonished,” the complaint said, and “accused of not being team players,” and had their “mental health and emotional stability questioned.”

After a phone call with health agency leaders to raise their fears about exposure to the virus, the staff members described a “whitewashing” of the situation, characterizing the response as “corrupt” and a “cover-up,” according to the complaint, and telling the whistle-blower that senior officials had treated them as a “nuisance” and did not want to hear their worries about health and safety.

Representative Jimmy Gomez, Democrat of California, whose office received the complaint, appeared to allude to it on Thursday morning at a hearing with Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of Health and Human Services, in the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Gomez was contacted by the whistle-blower, whom he had met before his congressional service, in part because his committee has jurisdiction over the health agency.

 At the hearing, Mr. Gomez had a tense exchange with the secretary in which he suggested that staff from the Administration for Children and Families had been exposed to the virus without the requisite training and equipment, and then dispersed elsewhere in the United States."

Edit - Figured I would add this for comparison's sake:

In a briefing to the media on Tuesday, officials from the centres for disease control and other health experts, said communities in the US should start planning for “social distancing measures”. **“It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,”** said Nancy Messonnier, **director of the national centre for immunisation and respiratory diseases.**

VS.

But in his own press conference on Wednesday, **Mr Trump** appeared to play down such certainty, while insisting his government was ready for whatever came. **“I don’t think it’s inevitable. I don’t think it’s inevitable because we’re doing a really job at the borders and checking people coming in,”** he said.

And some more:

**“View this the same as the flu,” he [President Trump] said**: “When somebody sneezes, I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible when they’re sneezing.” Turning to one of the health experts stood behind him, Mr Trump added: **“I really think, doc, you want to treat this like you treat the flu, and, you know, it’s going to be fine.”**

**The mortality rate for coronavirus is around 2 per cent – for regular flu it is closer to 0.1 per cent.**"

 ...The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Experts  raised concern that the **CDC's narrow testing criteria could mean that  there are more cases circulating among the general public that have not  been identified**.

“This raises the possibility that we only think  we have few cases in the US, because we have only tested a few hundred  people,” tweeted Ronald Klain, who was the czar overseeing Ebola  response in the Obama administration.

Investors have zero faith in American businesses making profit without Chinese manufacturing.

That’s why Trump’s trade wars with China is next level dumb, China could cripple our entire economy overnight with tariffs if they wanted to. We’d be fucked, it would virtually guarantee a market crash and a recession for at least a decade as we desperately try to set up our own supply lines. The government would have to step in and nationalize industries to prevent our economy from completely crumbling. 

Republicans like Nixon and Reagan KNEW outsourcing our manufacturing industries to the extent that we have was going to bite them in the ass eventually and become a national security risk, but they did anyway because it was going to make corporations filthy rich at the expense of American workers.

It’s been half a century of kicking the can down the road. Our economy simply isn’t functional without these massive bubbles that only exist to make the rich richer and gave them something to invest in. We’ve had the dotcom bubble, real estate bubble, the tech bubble, and now we have a DEBT BUBBLE, that Trump is desperately trying to keep afloat by having the FED lower interest rates, but he can only do that for so long before the whole entire house of cards crumbles down and billions of dollars go POOF into thin air.

It’s literally only a matter before we hit a recession and this time it will be the big one, the mother of all recessions and our economy, in all likelihood, will NEVER fully recover from. The government will be forced to step in and try to correct things.

American capitalists have been selling the rope they will be hung with for so long that they are almost out of rope. They have been trying to print money and use cheat codes but there is only so much blood you can extract from a rock.

It is going to take a massive restructuring of our economy to make it functional again, and that needs to happen soon because if we wait too long it will be like trying to waterproof a boat that is currently underwater.

It’s even worse because in the last 20 years Republicans have removed a lot of the protections that existed to prevent another Great Depression. When every major financial institution is gambling on the market WITH YOUR MONEY, when a crash happens it is going to crumble our entire economy. 

We are going to see another Great Depression soon unless we try to fix some of this shit. Bernie needs to rip off the bandaid because it is going to hurt a whole lot more if we keep putting it off. Our current economic course we are on right now is completely unsustainable. The only reason it’s been working for us is because America and the Dollar is seen as a stable investment, a stable place to put your money. When we fuck that up, and we will, investors all over the world are going to yank their money out all at the same time and instead invest in the Chinese economy that actually can show profit and growth. When that happens our economy is sure to have a crash that it will never recover from. We aren’t even doing capitalism right.

We either get the government to restructure our economy now, or the only way to sustain it will be to start another imperialist war and simply colonize another nation’s economy and resources. There is no other way. 

Socialism or Barbarism."

This is why in California the first cases don't show up in Chinatown, but instead show up in places like Bay Area suburbs, or near colleges.

EDIT: for the WSB Auts, this isn't like SPCE where it's hyped on revolutionary, lifechanging technology. There are literally dozens of companies funding coronavirus vaccine/treatment development. PLUS, clinical trials are slow to start in the US for 1 major reason: There's no sick people. 

For people to qualify for the clinical trial, they need to have been infected within a SPECIFIC timeframe prior to receiving treatment. There's literally not enough people for the trial to move along for now.

TLDR: wait 2 weeks for Americans to get sick so the clinical trial can move beyond testing just 1 person."

Roatan, Bay Islands  An American tourist aboard a cruise ship that arrived on Wednesday in Roatan, Bay Islands, died Thursday, February 27, at the public hospital of the Caribbean island of Honduras .  The victim responded to the name of Mashburn Dalrymple , 44, of US nationality. The first diagnosis indicated by the authorities is that the patient died of possible pneumonia due to the symptoms reported by her husband to the crew of the boat.  However, Forensic Medicine will treat the death of the patient following the sanitary protocols for suspected coronavirus , a disease she has in an emergency in the world due to the unstoppable increase in infections and deaths.  The lifting of the body occurred a few minutes ago inside the hospital of Roatán in charge of forensic doctors, agents of the Police Investigation Directorate (DPI), the Prosecutor's Office and the National Police.  According to the husband's account, Mashburn Dalrymple began presenting on Monday, February 24, cough, feverishness and chest pain on board the cruisewhich departed from the port of Galveston, Texas on Sunday, February 23. The ship continued its route through the Caribbean, on Tuesday, February 25, it landed in the port of Cozumel, Mexico , and on Wednesday, February 26, it reached the Bay Islands , an island area of Honduras ."

""The first challenge of sequencing a coronavirus genome is that it's made of RNA rather than DNA. Most of our tools for working with nucleic acids are specific to DNA. Fortunately, we've discovered an enzyme called ""reverse transcriptase"" that takes RNA and makes a DNA copy of it—transcription is the copying of DNA into RNA; this enzyme does the opposite, hence the name. (Reverse transcriptase was first identified in other RNA viruses that need to be copied into DNA as part of infection.) Using reverse transcriptase, researchers were able to make DNA copies of parts of 2019-nCoV as a first step to studying its genome.

But reverse transcription of samples from infected individuals would simply create a mess of DNA fragments from everything present: the patient's own cells, harmless bacteria, and so on. Fortunately, DNA sequencing and analysis techniques have become so advanced that it's now possible to just sequence the whole mess, irrelevant stuff and all, and let computers sort out what's present. Software is able to take what we know about the average coronavirus genome and identify all of the fragments of sequence that *look* like they came from a coronavirus. Other software can determine how all these fragments overlap and then stitch them together, producing a near-complete coronavirus genome.""

Treatment doesn't need to involve hospitalization for most cases. Drink plenty of fluids. Get plenty of rest. You'll most likely get better on your own. In rare cases where the disease is particularly bad, you may require support from a medical provider to remain properly hydrated/fed. But there is no actual process for treating the disease beyond supporting normal immune functions.

It's basically a new version of the common cold or flu. Which is really, really bad, because those diseases kill tons of people every year. But it's also not that big a deal, because most people will recover just fine."

Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sent more than a dozen workers to receive the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, without proper training for infection control or appropriate protective gear, according to a whistleblower complaint.

The workers did not show symptoms of infection and were not tested for the virus, according to lawyers for the whistleblower, who is a senior HHS official based in Washington who oversees workers at the Administration for Children and Families, a unit within HHS.

The whistleblower is seeking federal protection because she alleges she was unfairly and improperly reassigned after raising concerns about the safety of these workers to HHS officials, including those within the office of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. She was told Feb. 19 that if she does not accept the new position in 15 days, which is March 5, she would be terminated.

The whistleblower has decades of experience in the field, received two HHS department awards from Azar last year, and has received the highest performance evaluations, her lawyers said.
The complaint was filed Wednesday with the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal watchdog agency. The whistleblower’s lawyers provided a copy of a redacted 24-page complaint to The Washington Post. A spokesman for the Office of the Special Counsel said he could not comment on complaints filed with the office.

The complaint alleges that HHS staff were “improperly deployed” and were “not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation.” The complaint also alleges that the workers were potentially exposed to coronavirus because appropriate steps were not taken to protect them, and staff were not trained in wearing personal protective equipment, even though they had face-to-face contact with returning passengers. The workers were in contact with passengers in an airplane hangar where evacuees were received and on two other occasions: when they helped distribute keys for room assignments and hand out colored ribbons for identification purposes.

“We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act. We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time,” HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said.

The whistleblower, in her complaint, states that “appropriate steps were not taken to quarantine, monitor, or test [the workers] during their deployment and upon their return home.” The repatriated Americans were among those evacuated from Wuhan and quarantined on military bases in California and Texas because they were considered at high risk for contracting the flu-like illness.

About 14 personnel from the Administration for Children and Families, or ACF, were sent to March Air Force base in Riverside County, California, and another team of about 13 ACF personnel were sent to Travis Air Force in Fairfield, California, according to the complaint and the whistleblower’s lawyer, Ari Wilkenfeld. Several people within HHS voiced objection to sending the ACF personnel to receive passengers, according to a person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
AD

A second person familiar with the situation said the workers were not tested for coronavirus because none of them met the criteria, which was restricted at that time to people who had recent travel to China or contact with a confirmed case. The workers also did not exhibit any symptoms, the person said. If they had, appropriate protocol would have been followed.
The deployments took place Jan. 28 to 31, around the time when the first planeload of evacuees arrived at March, and Feb. 2 to Feb. 7, during the time when additional flights were arriving at Travis. The planes each carried about 200 Americans who were repatriated from Wuhan.

After their deployments, the workers returned to their normal duties, some taking commercial airline flights to return to their offices around the country, the lawyers said.

“Our client was concerned that ACF staff — who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus — were allowed to leave quarantined areas and return to their communities, where they may have spread the coronavirus to others,” said Lauren Naylor, one of the whistleblower’s lawyers.

The whistleblower is also seeking assistance from the office of Rep. Jimmy Gomez, (D-Ca.), a member of the House Ways and Means committee and vice chair of the House Oversight Committee, according to a Gomez spokesman.

During a hearing Thursday, Gomez asked Azar whether any employees from ACF could have been sent to help with the repatriation of Americans from Wuhan, China without any training in emergency response. Azar replied that some ACF employees were involved.
AD

Asked what sort of health and safety training the personnel received, and whether any of them were exposed to high-risk evacuees from China, Azar said: “They never should have been without P.P.E,” referring to personal protective equipment.
Asked whether any protocols may have been broken, given the urgency on the ground, Azar replied that urgency was never a reason for breaking safety protocols. “I don’t believe that has taken place,” Azar said said, adding that health and safety protocols “should always be followed.” He said that he did not personally know the names of the team, but that other department officials did. Pressed by Gomez what the department would do if untrained employees were exposed to the virus, Azar said: “I’d want to know the full facts, and we’d take appropriate remedial efforts.”
AD

The whistleblower said she received an email Jan. 25 about a potential deployment within ACF to support repatriation of the evacuated Americans, according to her lawyer. She initially supported the efforts because they had the “appearance that this was within ACF’s scope,” Naylor said. But later, she discovered the teams were dispatched without her knowledge by other senior officials at HHS. It was part of the agency’s “all-hands-on-deck” mission, Naylor said, but it broke agency protocol about what kinds of employees should respond to health emergencies. The whistleblower said she later found out about the deployment when she heard directly from some employees and other senior officials at HHS.

Some workers expressed concern about the lack of protective gear to the ACF team leader on the ground. That person joined ACF in September and had “no training or experience in any federal emergency management, public health emergency response, or safety or operational protocols to run the mission,” the complaint states.

ACF personnel typically deal with supporting people recovering from natural disasters, such as floods and fires, and helping victims apply for temporary assistance, all of which are under the category of human services, the whistleblower’s lawyers said. HHS officials broke established protocols for emergency support by sending ACF workers to a health emergency, for which they have no training, Naylor said. ACF, which has about 1,300 employees, has come under attack in recent years because of its role in sheltering and taking custody of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border who were separated from them by the Department of Homeland Security.
AD

The workers’ concerns about potential exposure to coronavirus were not addressed, the whistleblower’s lawyers said. “She was involuntarily assigned to a position in a subject matter where she has no expertise,” said Wilkenfeld, her lawyer, in an interview Thursday. The agency said the reason for the reassignment was “necessary to meet the needs of the department,” according to a memo she received. “If I did not accept involuntary reassignment, I would be terminated from federal service through adverse personnel action,” according to her complaint.

The mortality rate is higher then flu, and it's spreading across the globe at a concerning rate. 

The long period between infection & being symptomatic, during which you are contagious, likely means it's already got far more of a foothold in the states than we are yet aware of.

Lets review this comment in 2 weeks, and see how north america is doing, regarding being immune to the coronavirus. 

It is not alarmist to assume that it WILL become wide spread within the state by years end, hell, likely before summer. It's not gonna kill us all, far from in fact, but it is poised to kill far more then the flu."

America basically has only a few things keeping our economy and the market afloat right now, we have tech industries, financial industries, a strong dollar, and a large consumer base. All of these things will take a hit if the market crashes. All of them are heavily dependent on the market. Everything is connected to it, which is why people are seeing things like their retirement accounts go down because of the recent market crash.

Our government has already been essentially subsidizing our financial and tech industries by keeping taxes and interest rates artificially low, but there is only so much funny money you can create to keep these bubbles afloat. We have massively more consumer and corporate debt than we even have money, consumer and corporate debt is growing far faster than our economy. This isn’t the sign of a healthy economy. 

When these massive sectors of our economy crash because of the market, there will be nothing we can really do besides straight up printing money to bail out banks and corporations, which will only increase inflation and decrease the value of our dollar, which will hurt us even more. American and foreign investors will pull out and invest in more stable economies that can show growth like China.

Our economic policies over the last 50 years have essentially put us into an un-winnable situation. Our economy is unsustainable without cheap Chinese manufacturing, American financial institutions skimming off of the top of worldwide trade via the stock market and the strength of the dollar and our consumer base, all of which are heavily dependent on the market. We’ve been running along a razor wire praying everything remains intact. 

Our economy is a house of cards right now, as we are seeing. A reduction in Chinese manufacturing has caused our market to crash because investors simply don’t have faith that our industries will grow or create profit, which will become increasingly difficult. Look at companies like Uber and Tesla with massive valuations and high stock prices that only subsist on investor money. It’s a glorified ponzi scheme.

Rich corporations may be able to find other markets or automate things, but when American workers are no longer being paid anything, our consumer base will collapse. 

Again, it’s really an un-winnable situation. If we continue on this course, it’s not a question of if our economy will collapse, it’s when. Anything that will pull us out of it will be costly, unpopular, and in all likelihood crash the market for a while anyway.

Coronavirus is fucking us right now because we are uniquely unprepared to deal with something like this in every sense, medically, politically, and economically. 

We’ve spent decades prioritizing short term growth and kicking the can down the road, and now we are starting to catch glimpses of the end or that road."

So on top of this you have a job, especially if you don't wanna be *that* grad student living in the crappy grad dorms they give you. It's also nice to have some sort of life, friends, go out. Better maintain that GPA too because that can get you thrown out.

By the way, that's if you want to work in a pharmacutical lab, like this guy is doing. There are other things you can do with chemical engineering, and whatever actual field you go into has their own requirements. Like, say you want to work for the EPA. Add a master's degree in, I think it's Public Safety, and that masters is a 4 year program, on top of your BS (luckily they allow you to take that while persuing your BS), then your masters in Chemical Engineering.  ***Then*** and only once you have both masters, you gotta go to the Air Force base in Ohio for *at least* two years, but, let's be real, just like college has a 4 year program, you rarely get it done in 4 years. Most ppl are on the base for 4 years, on average.

Start out life with a few hundred thousand in debt, which is always great for your credit score, finding an apartment, turning on utilities. Practically no friends left (especially if you take that Ohio detour) because you were too busy for them. Long days, inconsistent hours until you make seniority at the company.

But no, we don't care to invest the time and the sacrifice it takes to work in that field. Friends, family, all taking a back seat so someone else doesn't die from cancer. From the flu. The Coronavirus. To make a 2 year old who's lived most of their life in a hospital not suffer from the dehabilitating immune disorder they have. 

Let's trust someone on Google, who studied from the school of being a mom, who hasn't read the studies, or even begin to know *how* to read the studies. An hour of researching other ppl, putting in even less work than the guy who wrote your middle school history textbook (believe it or not, it's filled with innacuracies because they put about as much work into researching and writing it as the antivaxxer mom with a blog). 

***She*** cares more than scientist who has dedicated at least 10 years to school alone (not counting HS) sacrificing his friends, starting a family, his own family, his own sleep, so *your* child doesn't die. Ruins his financial future, and will never be out of debt. 

I'm not saying that other ppl don't care. That the scientist cares more about children than there own mom. But to suggest one is more cold than the other. You don't give up your life because you hate people. You do it because you love them. You do it because you can see less people dying of AIDS, Hep C, the flu,  Ebola, mad cow. Because the one mom doesn't suffer from cancer. Because that child gets to go home and will live a relatively normal life.

And you may never even see these ppl. They are a number, not a face. But when it works, you are part of that. You know you were part of that with every FB post by someone who is telling the world their mom is in remission.

Source: I was a chemical engineering major. Yeah, there were aspects I loved. I'm just a very social person, and no matter what you do, science is a lonely job. And no matter how much I wanted it, I was miserable actually doing it. I'm still studying chemistry... For the hell of it I guess, but I've moved over to the AI programming and creation program, and I'm 1,000x happier doing that work. 

Yeah, miss chemical engineering a lot. Believe me, it was not an easy change."

The number represents a leap from the previous day, when there were 20 cases. The increase could be even greater, since another 213 notifications were sent by states, but the ministry's technicians were unable to make the analysis before the bulletin was finalized.

Coronavirus: see questions and answers about Covid-19
On Wednesday (26), the government confirmed the first positive case of coronavirus in Brazil. This is a man who lives in São Paulo, is 61 years old, and came from Italy.

In this new bulletin, no other case was confirmed. The growth in the number of cases occurs in parallel to the dispersion of cases in Europe and as a consequence of changes in protocol.

""The only change in the criteria for suspect cases is that we have now expanded the number of countries (now 16) that the patient has been in. Before it was just China"". - João Gabbardo dos Reis, Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Health
Suspicions of Covid-19

According to the executive secretary of the portfolio, João Gabbardo dos Reis, the technicians did not have time to analyze all the notifications received from the state health secretariats. He takes it for granted that among the more than 200 pending notifications, many will be classified as suspect cases. The executive secretary even mentioned the possibility of about 300 cases, considering the 132 suspects and the notifications that will still be confirmed.

Gabbardo explained that among the 132 suspects, two cases have already been tested for common respiratory viruses and have tested negative. Now they undergo specific analysis for the coronavirus.

Among the patients under investigation, 121 have a history of travel to countries with transmission of the disease, 8 other patients have had contact with suspected cases and three are contacts of the 61-year-old patient already confirmed with Covid-19.

For the early races, people were looking at Vietnam, but now it turns out that Bahrain got quite a few cases,

So I guess talking about it now makes sense. I just hope they already discuss concrete scenarios (with specific criteria) and plans for it, rather than saying ""too eary to say, let's talk again in 4 weeks"".

It’s true that Koontz named a fictional biological weapon “Wuhan-400” in this novel. It’s also true that Wuhan, China, is the city at the center of the 2020 coronavirus outbreak. However, that’s pretty much where the similarities end. 

Here are a few things this “prediction” gets wrong:

     In Koontz’s novel, “Wuhan-400” is a human-made weapon. The coronavirus, on the other hand, was not. 

     In the novel, “Wuhan-400” has a 100% fatality rate. While researchers are still learning about the coronavirus, the current fatality rate sits at about 2%. 

      The fictional “Wuhan-400” has an extremely quick incubation period of about four hours, compared to COVID-19 which has an incubation period between two and 14 days."

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/

Fortunately children seem to not seem badly affected by the disease. So far there have been zero deaths of children under age 9. It's mostly the olds and people with preexisting conditions that are at risk. 

Preexisting conditions stats aren't good. Cardiovascular disease (10.5% mortality), Diabetes (7.3%), Chronic respiratory disease (6.3%), Hypertension (6.0%), and Cancer (5.6%).

That's like killing 1 in 10 of the stereotypical fatass american middle aged demographic.

What is concerning for me, as a healthy 20-something is the potential to impact US supply chains and food access. Most urban and suburban grocers have only three days of food, and if we start to see regional quarantines or labor shortages, stores could start running out of food. So my plan is to buy some beans and rice, if I get sick ride it out like a flu, and maybe have my company place the workforce on mandatory leave?

America being America I'm expecting poor access to service for many sick, companies not willing to give sick leave, exorbitant doctors bills, and lots of other stupid shit that can turn a disease that could be managed into a public panic. And if it goes widespread I expect that a lot of old and unhealthy people may die, again fortunately not children, but I really worry for marginalized people like the homeless and impoverished old people."

He said none of his patients who had travelled back from at-risk countries had been given any information at airports or sea ports on what to do if they developed symptoms of coronavirus.

James said his practice had seen patients arriving back from affected areas, some of whom had been on cruises around many regions experiencing coronavirus outbreaks, who had not been given any information on what to do if they developed symptoms.

2020-02-27,_Doctor_Teeth_,nfl,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/faf3n0/thursday_talk_thread_yes_thats_the_thread_name/fiyrper/,"2% isn't high but to put it in perspective the mortality rate for the regular seasonal flu every year is roughly .1-.2%, so we're talking something that is potentially 10-20 times more deadly than the regular flu. in 2018, about 60,000 people died in the US from the flu. That means if the coronavirus infects the same number of people, we could be dealing with over a half million people dead from it. 

But even still, if you are under the age of like, 60, you are pretty safe. Nevertheless, someone on a podcast framed the 2% mortality rate in a way that I think is helpful: assuming it spreads to the same level as, say, the regular flu, you probably won't die, but everyone will probably know one person who does die.

The other concern is that while the mortality rate is 2%, roughly 10-20% of people who have been infected have required hospitalization. There's a very serious concern that our hospitals simply cannot accommodate that many people if the disease spreads out of control.

Finally, the biggest concern for most people is just how it will impact like....every day life. It's going to affect international supply chains, it's going to cause school closures, it's going to mean grocery stores are low on supplies and/or empty due to panic, the government might substantially limit travel. like, all of those things will probably impact your life in some direct or indirect way.

Edit: I should also add that another thing I learned on this podcast (today's episode of The Daily) is that this thing could come back in the fall. Apparently the spanish flu back in 1918 had a ""first wave"" in the winter/early spring but then went away during the summer and then came back again in a bigger second wave in the late fall/winter going into 1919. So, if we don't figure out a vaccine we could have another 
""wave"" of coronavirus after the summer/fall."

This is the Crux of the issue. 

Ebola was fecal-oral transmission. It requires poor hygiene for transmission.  Makes it deadly to underdeveloped and emerging nations with poor hygiene practices, but in Western nations where hand washing is much more common & frequent, food safety, and hygiene and cleanliness overall are all much much better, it struggles to infect new patients. 

Coronavirus is droplet transmission - coughing & sneezing emits an aerosol of virus particles that can then be inhaled or otherwise gain access to a new victim.  You can wash your hands every 10 minutes but if an infected individual sneezes in your face, you're still exposed."

About a year and a half ago my CPTSD blew up again. I thought a bunch of stuff I had worked on from my childhood had gotten out of hand. Wrong! It was my partner gaslighting next about a porn addiction, aka how he was coping with his own CPTSD. 

Now he’s in therapy and I’m working through that new trauma.

How people can’t see that Trump is no different than my lying, cheating, stealing, abusive, narcissistic, alcoholic father is beyond me. 

On top of dealing with the baseline childhood trauma, the lying/gaslighting/self-image and trust issues created by the new trauma, I feel like nothing I do matters because the idiot in charge of the country is going to get us nuked or killed in a Coronavirus pandemic. 

I’m at the point in my healing where I was starting to rekindle a love of art, something that died when I was 22 and had to drop out of art school because my dad stole my identity and the whole fucking system is rigged against working class people. I can’t quite seem to get started again because I constantly feel like there is no point. Like I should be focused on more important things, like trying to save US democracy or like if I have to leave my home, for one reason or another, the stupid watercolor set I bought, but haven’t opened yet, wouldn’t be important enough to take anyway.

Bought in August of last year and total return as of today has been 8.04%. As the amount of money I put in was an amount I was willing to lose I'll probably ride it out or maybe sell if it gets back down to purchase value and try out other investments. 

I'm not completely confident in my investing abilities so I feel like 'playing' with $5k to test the market and learn is a good way to go about it at the moment. 

I do feel for those who do have large sums of money in the market. I think this is only the beginning in terms of the coronavirus outbreak. I've been following the news closely and if all countries began properly testing everyone with flu-like symptoms I believe the number of cases will be in the thousands per country at the very least. That'll obviously tank the market - an end-of-the-world scenario for some or a fire-sale scenario for others.

Could the impending doom and 'apocalyptic' scenario of a market crash and global recession which many here have been almost wishing for or prophesying about finally come?

Several new cases of corona have been confirmed in Sweden, the Public Health Agency reports on Thursday evening. There are five new cases around Sweden. Three have been infected after travel abroad, two have been infected in Sweden.

Another five people in Sweden have been detected infected by the coronavirus. This applies to three people in Västra Götaland, one person in the Uppsala Region and one person in the Stockholm region, the Public Health Agency writes in a press release on Thursday evening.

Two of the people in Västra Götaland have had close contact with the person who was previously found infected during Wednesday. The third person in Västra Götaland has been infected during a trip in northern Italy.

A person in Uppsala has been infected during a trip in Germany. That person is now receiving care.

One person in the Stockholm region was infected during a trip in Iran and is now treated in isolation at the Karolinska University Hospital's infectious clinic.

Now we work according to our routines. The patient receives care and we carry out infection tracking to reach any persons the patient may have had contact with. It is important to emphasize that what we have now confirmed is a case of a person who has been infected outside Sweden and not here in Stockholm, says Per Follin, Infectious Disease Surveyor at Infectious Diseases Stockholm in a press release.

In total, there are now seven cases of corona in Sweden.

The public health authority now estimates that the risk of more people being discovered in Sweden infected by the new corona virus abroad is high.

It was expected that we would receive new cases of infection in Sweden. So far, all cases of covid-19 are connected to travelers, directly or indirectly through close contact with an infected person and we currently do not see any general spread of infection out in the community, says Britta Björkholm, Head of Department at the Public Health Authority in a press release.

The Public Health Authority will hold a press conference at 20:00."

2020-02-27,chimchimcharoo412,Coronavirus,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fakk9a/us_workers_without_protective_gear_assisted/fiyuadv/,"Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sent more than a dozen workers to receive the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak,without proper training for infection control or appropriate protective gear, according to a whistleblower complaint.
The workers did not show symptoms of infection and were not tested for the virus,according to lawyers for the whistleblower, a senior HHS official based in Washington who oversees workers at the Administration for Children and Families, a unit within HHS.
The whistleblower is seeking federal protection, alleging she was unfairly and improperly reassigned after raising concerns about the safety of these workers to HHS officials, including those within the office of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. She was told Feb. 19 that if she does not accept the new position in 15 days, which is March 5, she would be terminated.
The whistleblower has decades of experience in the field, received two HHS department awards from Azar last year and has received the highest performance evaluations, her lawyers said.
The complaint was filed Wednesday with the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal watchdog agency. The whistleblower’s lawyers provided a copy of a redacted 24-page complaint to The Washington Post. A spokesman for the Office of the Special Counsel said he could not comment on complaints filed with the office.
The complaint alleges HHS staff were “improperly deployed” and were “not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation.” The complaint also alleges the workers were potentially exposed to coronavirusbecause appropriate steps were not taken to protect them and staffers were not trained in wearing personal protective equipment, even though they had face-to-face contact with returning passengers. The workers were in contact with passengers in an airplane hangar where evacuees were received and on two other occasions: when they helped distribute keys for room assignments and hand out colored ribbons for identification purposes.
In some instances, the teams were working alongside personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in “full gown, gloves and hazmat attire,” the complaint said.
“We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act. We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time,” HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said.
The whistleblower, in her complaint, states that “appropriate steps were not taken to quarantine, monitor, or test [the workers] during their deployment and upon their return home.” The repatriated Americans were among those evacuatedfrom Wuhan and quarantined on military bases in California and Texas because they were considered at high risk for contracting the flu-like illness.
About 14 personnel from the Administration for Children and Families, or ACF, were sent to March Air Force base in Riverside County, Calif., and another team of about 13 ACF personnel were sent to Travis Air Force in Solano County, Calif., according to the complaint and the whistleblower’s lawyer, Ari Wilkenfeld. In Solano County this week, the first U.S. patient was confirmed to be infected with coronavirus who did not travel to a region where it is spreading or have known contact with someone diagnosed with the disease.
Several people within HHS voiced objection to sending the ACF personnel to receive passengers, according to a person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
A second person familiar with the situation said the workers were not tested for coronavirus because none of them met the criteria, which was restricted at that time to people with symptoms and either a recent trip to China or close contact with a person confirmed to be infected with covid19. If the workers had exhibited symptoms, appropriate protocol would have been followed.
The deployments took place Jan. 28 to 31, around the time when the first planeload of evacuees arrived at March, and Feb. 2 to Feb. 7, during the time when additional flights were arriving at Travis. The planes each carried about 200 Americans who were repatriated from Wuhan.
After their deployments, the workers returned to their normal duties, some taking commercial airline flights to return to their offices around the country, the lawyers said.
“Our client was concerned that ACF staff — who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus — were allowed to leave quarantined areas and return to their communities, where they may have spread the coronavirus to others,” said Lauren Naylor, one of the whistleblower’s lawyers.
The whistleblower is also seeking assistance from the office of Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), a member of the House Ways and Means committee and vice chair of the House Oversight Committee, according to a Gomez spokesman.
During a hearing Thursday, Gomez asked Azar whether any employees from ACF could have been sent to help with the repatriation of Americans from Wuhan without any training in emergency response. Azar replied that some ACF employees were involved.
Asked what sort of health and safety training the personnel received and whether any of them were exposed to high-risk evacuees from China, Azar said: “They never should have been without P.P.E,” referring to personal protective equipment.
Asked whether any protocols may have been broken, given the urgency on the ground, Azar replied urgency was never a reason for breaking safety protocols.
“I don’t believe that has taken place,” Azar said said, adding that health and safety protocols “should always be followed.” He said he did not personally know the names of the team, but other department officials did. Pressed by Gomez what the department would do if untrained employees were exposed to the virus, Azar said: “I’d want to know the full facts, and we’d take appropriate remedial efforts.”

The whistleblower said she received an email Jan. 25 about a potential deployment within ACF to support repatriation of the evacuated Americans, according to her lawyer. She initially supported the efforts because they had the “appearance that this was within ACF’s scope,” Naylor said. But later, she discovered the teams were dispatched without her knowledge by other senior officials at HHS. It was part of the agency’s “all-hands-on-deck” mission, Naylor said, but it broke agency protocol about what kinds of employees should respond to health emergencies. The whistleblower said she later found out about the deployment when she heard directly from some employees and other senior officials at HHS.

Some workers expressed concern about the lack of protective gear to the ACF team leader on the ground. That person joined ACF in September and had “no training or experience in any federal emergency management, public health emergency response, or safety or operational protocols to run the mission,” the complaint states.
ACF personnel typically deal with supporting people recovering from natural disasters, such as floods and fires, and helping victims apply for temporary assistance, all of which are under the category of human services, the whistleblower’s lawyers said. HHS officials broke established protocols for emergency support by sending ACF workers to a health emergency for which they have no training, Naylor said. ACF, which has about 1,300 employees, has been criticized in recent years because of its role in sheltering and taking custody of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border who were separated from family members by the Department of Homeland Security.
The workers’ concerns about potential exposure to coronavirus were not addressed, the whistleblower’s lawyers said.

“She was involuntarily assigned to a position in a subject matter where she has no expertise,” Wilkenfeld, her lawyer, said in an interview Thursday. The agency said the reason for the reassignment was “necessary to meet the needs of the department,” according to a memo she received. “If I did not accept involuntary reassignment, I would be terminated from federal service through adverse personnel action,” according to her complaint.

Getting a flu shot is also just a no brainer thing to do and a decent thing to do, irrespective of the coronavirus threat. 

Even if you are otherwise healthy and contract the flu but have no or mild symptoms, you might still spread the flu virus to someone elderly, sick or otherwise immunocompromised who might develop serious complications from the flu."

>Falcon Aviation Academy’s location at the Newnan-Coweta County Airport shut down most of its operations suddenly on Wednesday afternoon, according to documents provided by former employees and students of the flight school.
The flight school, which also has locations at Peachtree City’s Falcon Field and the Athens-Ben Epps Airport, primarily trains Chinese aviation students, and the program suspension appears to be connected to the outbreak of coronavirus in China.

>The Peachtree City and Athens programs also ceased operations, according to staff at both airports.

>In a message to Chinese students, academy representatives state that “due to external factors beyond our control that have impacted the Chinese training operation and enforcement, Falcon Aviation Academy will be suspending your training from 4 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 26.""

>The message states that Falcon is “working with your airline to determine next steps for you.”

>Chinese students were directed in the message to remain at their apartments and await further communications. The message ends with Falcon and its team apologizing for “the interruption to your training and for any inconvenience caused.""

>Some students live in apartments around Coweta County, while others live in a former motel on U.S. 29 South, which was purchased by the academy and converted into dorms.

>Some employees were terminated Wednesday, while others will remain with the company, according to the documents provided to The Newnan Times-Herald.

>An email to staff from Falcon Human Resources Manager Jennifer Reid says the company has been forced to reduce staffing because of the suspension of the Chinese program.

>In the email, employees are instructed to gather their personal belongings and collect envelopes with their names on them in order to find out their next steps.

>Jessica Bailey said she was a shuttle driver for the Chinese program for seven months. When she got to work Wednesday, she said, police were telling everyone to get their things and go home.
“Students are still here and don’t know what to do. Many are on the verge of graduating,” she said. “We just want answers.”

>There were numerous vehicles in the parking lot at Falcon on Thursday afternoon, but the doors to the building were locked.

>When contacted two weeks ago about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak could have on the Chinese training program, Reid said it was too early to provide a fair assessment.

>“Many of our contacts have just returned to work this past Monday,” Reid said on Feb. 14. “Our most recent class arrived in early December, almost a month before news of this new virus was reported, and none of the students exhibited sickness.""

>Reid said on Feb. 14 the company was continuing to monitor news reports and checking in with official government agencies “in anticipation of the virus diminishing and commerce with China returning to normal.""

>Officials at Falcon could not be reached for comment on Thursday. Calls are answered by an automated system that gives no indication of problems, and there was no notice on either the company’s website or Facebook page of the program shutdown.

>Facebook posts from Feb. 19-21 seem to indicate business as usual. A Feb. 20 post shows an airplane wing in the clouds and states “If your dreams look like this, they look a lot like ours and WE WANT TO TALK TO You! Let Falcon Aviation Academy help you reach your goals through our Airline Professional Pilot Program” followed by several hashtags, including #cantstop and #wontstop."

Part of the reason it's been so hard to contain and manage this virus is that someone can be infected and never show it.

It's true this isn't like seasonal flu for a few core reasons.

Seasonal flu is already known. We have preparations. One of the interesting traits is that people under 30 rarely get infected; the theory I've heard is people that get common cold (which are other strains of corona virus) often recently (ie. children) have gained natural resistance to corona-like viruses. But still the thing is our infrastructure and managing the whole scenario. Conventions and ideas on how to triage are not well defined yet.

Seasonal flu has a vaccine. I remember when H1N1 came out, and people were terrified. Long-story the virus won, it was so bad that they removed the identifier, it used to be called n2009-AH1N1 virus. But it completely overtook the other H1N1 strains and is now the common strain. What happened? Well the virus became less dangerous, as resistance overall improved (herd immunity also improves resistance) and a vaccine was developed.

This isn't to say that the virus shouldn't be something we care for, but that we are acting accordingly (though the president's budget strategy in the US is really looking limited right now) to the threat level. While we should be worried and check it, we shouldn't panic and even in the worst case scenario it won't be a collapse of society. The worst-worst case, a spanish-flu level pandemic you won't die, and people close to you won't die, but you will know someone that died. That's the worst in death tolls levels that we could see from a virus like this. Generally we should expect it to be different."

I'm copying this from a previous post.

It's important to note that biologics typically target a specific protein. For example cosentyx targets inf-17. Stelara targets il12 and 23 and TREMFYA is il-23 Each of these cytokines plays different roles in the immune response (check out the first link below to see specific examples). In the link below you can see that people with il-17 are at higher risk for fungal infections like candida while il-6 blockers are more likely to get other infections.

It seems that we have specific sections of our immune system which are compromised but that is different than say someone with diabetes. High blood sugar among other complications from diabetes lowers overall immunity. It has a much greater impact on many parts of the immune system. The second link is a well sourced explanation of all the ways diabetes impacts the immune system.

So as you can see if we compare our suppression of one protein to the effects of diabetes there is clearly a difference. So while I think it would be prudent to avoid being sick I don't believe we are in the same extent immunocompromised as people we see dying from the coronavirus . Should it start to spread elsewhere in the world as significantly as it is in China then you could come off your meds for a bit but I don't think you have to worry about being in a high risk class where death is more likely. Obviously I'm assuming you have no other ailments and are otherwise a healthy individual.

Hope this helps!

Not that I think your capable of grasping it (this comment is directed towards others not you), you don’t need to see news predicting an upswing in the future if your intuition is that the downturn in effect is pure over speculation.

The news spurring you to buy is the one that caused the 1000 point drop. Intuitively you know (because as a social being, as well as someone who witnessed the stupidity of u/createdtopostthisnow earlier) that speculation about the coronavirus is probably larger than what the overall consequences will end up being.

Recognize that today was not a “correction” the correction will take place once people realize that they overreacted and things start to get moving again.

- the timing and geography don’t work for blaming trump for the epidemic. The us has offered China every assistance to handle this, but there’s 51 cases in the us vs 80,000 in China. 
- the US assessed contributions to the WHO, what were talking about with his cuts, is not a [large percentage of their budget or even the majority of us contribution.](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-government-and-the-world-health-organization/). We’re talking about less than $60m for a worldwide organization with a ~$2.25 billion annual budget. This isn’t going to send The WHO under here. 
- that’s the budget moving forward for 2020. As in, it hasn’t been collected and passed along to the WHO yet. You can’t say trumps actions over the past month caused an ongoing epidemic than began months ago. It’s not like the WHO would have come up with a vaccine this month but trump started talking about cutting funding and the doctors walked out in protest. He could have doubled funding and we’d be in the exact same position right now that we’re currently in. 

Tl;dr - how exactly was trump supposed to stop an epidemic in China? How exactly is a $60m cut over the next year to a $2.25 budget supposed to have impeded the work over the past 2 months at the WHO? These actions certainly make us less safe moving forward, but are not the cause of the current epidemic."

The CDC has sent 10 staffers to help trace her contacts, Newsom said.

Solano County is also home to Travis Air Force Base, where several hundred people were quarantined after returning on repatriation flights from Wuhan and the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Multiple positive coronavirus cases have been reported among those groups. But Dr. Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health, said there is no evidence of a connection between the woman and the returning travelers.

Newsom said the state expected that the virus would transmit within the community.

“What happened in Solano County did not surprise anybody,” Newsom said. “I think the only thing ... that surprised folks was it didn’t happen sooner.”


Some local governments have declared states of emergency amid coronavirus fears, including Santa Clara County on Feb. 10, San Diego County last week, San Francisco on Tuesday and Orange County on Wednesday.

Such a declaration creates a mechanism for officials to ask for mutual aid from state and federal partners in the event that resources are exhausted, Orange County health officer Nichole Quick said Wednesday.

Los Angeles County officials also are discussing whether to declare a public health emergency.

There is no defined criteria, such as a certain number of coronavirus cases, for what merits an emergency declaration, said L.A. City emergency management department general manager Aram Sahakian in a meeting with city council members on Wednesday.


“If the core group preparing for this incident feels and sees the need for additional resources and additional multi-agency coordination, they can pull the trigger on it,” he said. “It doesn’t mean it’s out of control. It doesn’t mean we’re going to panic.”

The last time the L.A. county declared a public health emergency was in 2017 during a Hepatitis A outbreak.

The Hepatitis A outbreak required extraordinary measures because the disease was difficult to contain and required widespread vaccination efforts, said L.A. County health department epidemiologist Dr. Prabhu Gounder in a meeting with city council members on Wednesday. California officials declared a state of emergency at that time as well.

“At the time, there was a shortage of Hepatitis A vaccine. We would not have been able to get this additional vaccine for the response without the state declaration,” Gounder said."

""You don't even need a second type of the virus. ADE is happening with the same virus that was cured the first time. You just need to get reinfected""

Dengue, and I thought MERS (?), seemed to require reinfection with different versions of the virus...which was slightly reassuring given the lack of mutation or emergence of novel strains of this coronavirus (AFAIK).

If this is confirmed, as you said, it really does limit the likeliehood of a quick vaccine being developed. Hopefully they are carefully following the reinfection cases. I havent heard if they are experiencing more severe symptoms on the second round."

Francis will proceed with the rest of his planned work Thursday, but “preferred to stay near Santa Marta,” the Vatican hotel where he lives, officials said.

Preliminary fatality rate is only 0,57 % which is positive if it remains that low.

36 remains in serious/critical condition

5.7% of the cases have so far ended up serious/critical. The most worrying stat.

These cases have had the virus for a good while, but I'm not certain of the time line here.

While the demographic is older than average, they were healthy enough to go cruising around the world and they were wealthy which often indicates decent health. Still I would estimate a higher risk than the population in general.

All in all I think it indicates a considerable degree of undetected, mild / asymptomatic cases and that the observed fatality rate is therefore overestimated.

US companies will post no earnings growth this year as the coronavirus outbreak becomes widespread, Goldman Sachs warned, as fears over the economic fallout from the epidemic have intensified.

The bank revised lower its baseline earnings per share estimate to $165 this year, down from $174 previously — representing no growth. By comparison consensus is for companies on S&P 500 in aggregate to post earnings growth of about 7.7 per cent this year, according to data provider FactSet.

We likely will not know a solid number until this is all over. Everyone is just guessing. The death rate varies wildly from location to location. Hubei has a much higher death rate than anywhere else in china, going by china's numbers. The numbers outside of china are too low and too early to really give us any sense of it, statistically.

Everyone is guessing. Even the experts are just giving their best guess. Except the people still saying its just the flu, they're lying. 

This site has a good run down of calculation types : [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#correct](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#correct)  


My personal suspicion is that the death rate is lower than calculations show because mostly mild and asymptomatic cases are getting missed. It's much easier, even if not foolproof, to confirm at death or admission to hospital than it is to scan the entire asymptomatic/mild cold population. The closest we have to a model for how many people may be asymptomatic  or mild but still test positive would be if someone did a full analysis on the diamond princess cases, but remember there the demographics skew much older than the general population. And even diamond princess didn't test everyone for some reason i cannot fathom. And like you said, the tests are not perfect either.

So I would assume the real rate is lower than we're seeing, but even a 1% death rate is much higher than the flu. 

It also varies hugely by age group. Age and preexisting conditions are the big factors. This thing hits worse the older you are. The very very incomplete statistics weirdly seem to show that its patterns don't hit 'young and old' but just 'old'. But that could change. It could all change. It's just too early in this thing to tell.

For comparison, our best guess for the 1918 pandemic is 2-3% but our estimate for that is also wild guessing, highly geographically variable, and also contends with government misreporting and censorship. Epidemiology is hard.

  
TL;DR - its worse than the flu, we don't know how much worse, and we likely won't for sure ever, or at least until its over. we're probably missing more of the mild / asymptomatic cases than deadly ones, even if testing is not perfect for either group, so the rate is probably lower, but not as low as seasonal flu."

Dear Members of the NYU Community,

While there are and have been no cases of anyone in the NYU community contracting the coronavirus known now as COVID-19, here in New York or elsewhere, developments resulting from the spread of the virus continue to be felt widely: in industry, in financial markets, in travel, among public health authorities and providers, and among the regions where its reach has been greatest.  

So, this is an apt moment to update you again, particularly because of the changes in circumstances for our fellow community members at NYU Florence.

As you may have heard in recent news accounts, the incidence of new coronavirus cases has increased sharply in northern Italy.  In response, the Italian government has taken swift action, including quarantining a set of towns in regions to the north of Tuscany, where NYU Florence is located.

While we do not believe there is a particularly pressing health threat to the NYU Florence community, the events of the last few weeks has conveyed a sharp lesson to us about how countries, in their public health efforts to curb the spread of the virus, can act swiftly and unexpectedly in ways that could abruptly restrict our community members' ability to travel.

So, against this backdrop, out of an abundance of caution, and guided by the priority we place on the well-being of our students, we have made the decision to:

* Cancel classes for the rest of the week at NYU Florence
* Have all students promptly travel home or to another appropriate location, which staff will assist them in doing with logistical and financial support
* Suspend operations at the campus on Thursday
* Resume holding classes remotely starting next Monday, making use of the tools being used by NYU Shanghai as well as the experience we have gained.

We plan to have the NYU Florence community carry on in this manner until at least March 29, when we hope everyone can reconvene at Villa La Pietra.  We are also currently advising students elsewhere in Europe against [travel](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/health-alerts/travel-guidance.html) to northern Italy.

We know that for many of these students, the opportunity to spend a semester in Florence -- a world center of culture, art, and beauty -- was a dream.  As a community, we share their sense of disappointment and regret that this illness has emerged to disrupt their studies in this manner, and their hope that things will be back to normal at the end of March. 

At NYU Shanghai, classes - which are meeting remotely - successfully got underway last week, and [they are proceeding well](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/news/so-far-so-good-nyu-shanghai-completes-first-week-distance-learning).  Vice Chancellor Jeff Lehman, who is teaching a course this semester called “Creativity Considered,” conveyed to me that while everyone would, naturally, prefer to be together in a classroom, he and his co-teacher were pleased to find that the online tools we have employed have, in fact, allowed him to maintain authentic discussion and engagement.  He said he has received similar, positive reports from other members of the NYU Shanghai faculty.  And the students have not only been resolute and patient, but [gracious in their praise (PDF)](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/nyuStories/documents/Shanghai-Thankyou.pdf) for the work that faculty and academic support did to get the semester underway.

Although US health officials have indicated that they do [expect to see some spread of the virus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/02/25/cdc-coronavirus-inevitable/) in the US, there have not yet been any cases in New York City.  Classes started here on January 27, and the vast majority of our community had assembled here by that time; by this point, we are well outside the incubation window for those who were here for the start of classes. 

In the 60-plus years since NYU opened a site in Madrid, it has increasingly deepened its commitment to global education and engagement.  Today, it is at the forefront of global higher education among US universities.

No one believed it would be easy, and that was not why we embraced that trajectory.  The determination to engage the world also meant engaging the world's challenges; that is intentional: we want our students and faculty to help find the needed solutions.  Having chosen this direction, NYU will inevitably be among the first universities to grapple with the complexities of increasingly interconnected world. 

Global is the right course for NYU. And if it sometimes presents us with hurdles, our reaction should be to surmount them calmly, resiliently, and resolutely, as we have in this instance."

2020-02-27,Rethgil,Coronavirus,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/faifsg/i_have_read_everything_from_this_is_apocalyptic/fiycw4i/,"Two main problems make this thing bad.

1. A virus that kills or shows symptoms quick is actually good in that stopping the spread is easier because you can see who has it, whoe doesnt, and isolate them safely before they spread it to lots of other people. But the coronavirus doesnt show itself for 14 to 24 days. Compared to other previous scary viruses, thats bad-thats a long time.  Some people show no symptoms but spread it. Thats bad. Buuuuut..... the death rate is allegedly low, compared to previous scary viruses, which is a good thing. If we believe the official numbers.

2. People havent considered the global economy which has a big role in this. Since the global crash in  2008, and tbe many invasions, many or most countries  have very few resources such as hospitals, experts, resources, spare economic means available, to deal with unexpected costly events like this. So that also impacts every nations ability to act, to care for ill people, or contain or research things. Also, despite this,, more people than ever travel abroad and thus spread hings internationally.  Though obviously this is stopping pretty fast now.

So consider those two factors. So long as the death rate stays low, and IF national givernments are pressured by their citizens to act fast and give proper care and spend money, although many people may get ill, most should recover, and it should hopefully be over in months.

Bad side? That at some point the virus will mutate, as all do. We have to hope systems are in place by that point, so that if the mutation means the death rate evolves to 10 or more percent,  that governments have by that time built more hospitals, employed more doctors,  bought plenty of detection kits and so on.

Short answer? Like anything,  the risk partly comes down to how much money our leaders are prepared to spend defending the poor and sick or would rather keep it all for the rich and privelleged who can afford to avoid public transport, crowds, crowded offices, and get tbe best healthcare through their wealth."

2020-02-27,dvdmovie1,investing,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fak7l3/thoughts_on_expedia_expe/fiyoo6h/,"1. Expedia has been considerably weak over the last year even before Coronavirus. Management was booted and Barry Diller is currently running the company; there will probably be further changes made.

2. Booking has been the better run company for a long time now with a great CEO.

3. I'd rather own Hilton or Marriott; both are certainly not going to do well in a downturn or this situation, but looking long-term, I like those businesses better than something like Expedia.

4. Would really space out any travel stock purchases considerably. This situation is going to effect travel in particular and best case is probably if things stay around these levels for a while. Worst case and these names can go a lot lower.

5. There has been considerable concern about Google getting further into travel and this has effected Expedia in particular. In terms of the Google aspect, there was a good speech by Chamath Palihapitiya about Google late last year. (https://www.travolution.com/articles/113365/phocuswright-2019-googles-search-for-its-next-act-is-harming-travel-firms)

""Palihapitiya said this can be seen in how Google is being run. “The first thing they do is separate the core search business, which is effectively Google, from everything else.

“The second thing to buy themselves more time is they turn up the heat on the core search business to make more money. The longer they take to find that second act the more you’re fucked.”

My wife and I had a couple of disagreements like this early on but are now on the same page as the inevitable progression of this disease becomes ever more apparent.

She finally admitted after a while that the reason she was getting snappy with me was because she was scared. She's a nurse and is working on the front lines with no guidance from the hospital, no idea when the first coronavirus patient will show up under the radar and knows exactly what bad pneumonia looks like.

Our preparations have eased our minds to a degree and now we know we'll just do the best we can and hope for the best while continuing to take all precautions possible. It eased my mind a lot one morning when she woke up and suggested we practice putting on a respirator correctly because ""most people don't know what the hell they're doing.""

I can't really provide a full estimate since I'm the type of person that doesn't really operate off of a budget when it comes to travelling. I'll identify places I want to go before the trip and try to go to them. 

But for our first trip, we focused on sushi, ramen, udon, and some misc. foods/snacks. The items that were least worth it were all in Tsukiji (not counting the actual sit down restaurants that are in there, moreso the vendors that serve street food). It's not necessarily that they were overpriced, but moreso that they didn't provide anything outstandingly delicious. We ate so much there that we ended up skipping lunch. 

Our most expensive meal was sushi for lunch, which ended up costing us about $120 each. We tried sushi at other restaurants as well that were much lower in price than our lunch meal, and the quality was excellent. 

But if we are still able to go on our next trip, we have another high end sushi restaurant booked. We're making a more conscience effort to go to more ramen/tsukemen restaurants. 

Most memorable cheap eats: 

 * Lawsons Spicy Nuggets. I cannot preach enough about these bad boys. They're about 200 JPY and are so damn tasty (especially when fresh). 

 * Mochi donuts from Mister Donut. About 150 JPY depending on which you get. Mochi donuts are becoming more of a craze here in the States, but Mister Donut is the first place I've had them and they're still my favorite ones. There's a light chewiness to them and weren't too sweet. My parents liked the more savory options, but my wife and I preferred the sweeter choices. The strawberry one tasted like Pocky."

I am traveling to Japan next month (3/2-3/30) and am seeing museums/events/attractions get canceled or closed to contain coronavirus. I'm looking for some 'back-up' ideas of things to see and do if the items on my itinerary get shut down. Obviously, we don't know for sure what will be closed or open as the situation changes, so looking for things most likely that won't be canceled or closed even if things escalate. For example, even though teamlab planets or Disney aren't closed now there is a chance they might be in the coming weeks so I'm looking for back-ups for those activities just in case. Even if the interior is closed of shrines, I am assuming I would still be able to go to the shrine and appreciate it from the outside. This will mostly be a list of open-activity things that you don't book or get tickets for. Looking for any suggestions of things to consider!

Tokyo:

Yoyogi park and Meiji Shrine

Shinjuku Gyoen

Explore Akihabara, Asakusa, Shibuya, etc.

Sumida Park

Ueno Park

Sensoji Temple

Day trip to Hakone



Osaka:

Himeji (even if I can't go inside it)

Osaka Castle



Kyoto:

Assuming I will still be able to visit major shrines/ parks (Arashiyama bamboo grove and monkey park, fushimi inari, kinkaku-ji, philosphers path, kiyomizu-deru)

Kibune to Kurama Hike

Nara:

Temples and deer park
